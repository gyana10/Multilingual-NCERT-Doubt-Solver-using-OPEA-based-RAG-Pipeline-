At the same time, it aims to prepare students to engage constructively with the opportunities and challenges of the 21st century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. By nurturing students’ inherent abilities across all five planes of human existence (pañchakośhas), the Foundational and Preparatory Stages set the stage for further learning at Middle Stage. Spanning Grades 6 to 8, the Middle Stage serves as a critical three-year bridge between the Preparatory and Secondary Stages. The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages — including at least two languages native to India — to Science, Mathematics, Social Science, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas, as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy — a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. Ganita Prakash, the textbook of Mathematics for Grade 7, Part I, aligns with the expectations of NEP 2020 and NCF-SE 2023, with respect to creating a spark for initiating mathematical thinking. This textbook designed for Grade 7 students, takes forward its journey through the world of mathematics that started in Grade 6. During this journey the concepts and problems emerge from daily life situations and so it is expected that students will be able to relate to them with ease. The book makes efforts to encourage the students to observe and explore the patterns around them and discover mathematical concepts on their own. The content attempts to integrate mathematics with other subject areas such as science, social science with cross-cutting themes like environmental education, value education, inclusive education, and Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS). Colourful illustrations and interactive exercises form the basis of this textbook that would develop a strong foundation among children in understanding more complex mathematical"}

Throughout the book, stories, conversations and anecdotes have been incorporated to make abstract mathematical concepts more relatable and accessible to young learners. Puzzles and innovative problems will not only engage the students in thoughtfully relating the mathematical concepts to the world around them and help them in deepening their understanding of mathematics, but also prepare them to understand the concepts of the emerging field of computational thinking. The focus is on collaboration and active engagement through student-centered approach to education. However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years.

{"class": "class 7", "subject": "maths", "page_no": 5, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "ABOUT THE BOOK Mathematics helps students develop not only basic arithmetic skills, but also the crucial capacities of logical reasoning, creative problem solving, and clear and precise communication (both oral and written). Mathematical knowledge also plays a crucial role in understanding concepts in other school subjects, such as Science and Social Science, and even Arts, Physical Education, and Vocational Education. Learning Mathematics can also contribute to the development of capacities for making informed choices and decisions. Understanding numbers and quantitative arguments is necessary for effective and meaningful democratic and economic participation. Mathematics thus has an important role to play in achieving the overall aims of school education. Mathematics at the Middle Stage is a major challenge and has to perform the dual role of being both close to the experience and environment of the child and being abstract. It must perform the dual role of developing intuition while also maintaining and emphasising rigour. It must perform the dual role of enhancing critical and logical thinking while also developing artistry and creativity and a sense of elegance and aesthetics. Finally, Mathematics must perform the dual role of providing students plenty of opportunities for exploration and discovery of concepts on their own while also teaching best- known methods in the global repertoire of mathematics. The present textbook has made an attempt to address the above mentioned goals and challenges of learning mathematics. The writers of this book have aimed to strike a judicious balance between informal and formal definitions and methods to develop in students both intuition and rigour. The book also provides numerous opportunities for student-student and student–teacher interaction in the classroom to promote active and experiential learning. A number of questions, puzzles, and interactive exercises are posed throughout the book to encourage constant exploration. Many of the questions are open- ended to stimulate in-class discussion. The first chapter of this book, ‘Large Numbers Around Us’, is an introduction to the world of lakhs and crores, and millions and billions through engaging explorations and contexts. Chapter 2, ‘Arithmetic Expressions’, considers expressions having multiple operations and discusses how they can be written and read without ambiguity. Chapter 3, ‘A Peek Beyond the Point’, introduces the usage of the decimal point and additions and subtractions involving decimal numbers. Chapter 4, ‘Expressions using Letter-Numbers’ builds on the chapter on Arithmetic Expressions to guide students to take the first steps into the world of algebra. The fundamental notions of letter-numbers and algebraic expressions are introduced. Chapter 5, ‘Parallel and Intersecting Lines’, introduces some fundamental building blocks of geometry and has a balance of engaging activities like paper folding and rigorous mathematical reasoning. Chapter 6, ‘Number Play’, covers aspects of computational thinking and problem solving through puzzles and concepts of parity, the Virahāṅka-Fibonacci sequence, and cryptarithms. Chapter 7, ‘A Tale of Three Intersecting Lines’,"}
{"class": "class 7", "subject": "maths", "page_no": 6, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "vi explores, through construction, some of the striking properties of a triangle related to the lengths of their sides and angles. Chapter 8, ‘Working with Fractions’, builds on the students’ understanding of fractions, and explores the multiplication and division of fractions. The methods and formulas of the great Indian mathematician Brahmagupta (628 CE) for performing these operations on fractions is brought alive with fresh examples and interesting puzzles. In all chapters, an attempt has been made to emphasise connections with other subjects including Art, History, and Science. By weaving together storytelling and hands-on activities, we hope that an immersive learning experience will be created that ignites curiosity and fosters a love for mathematics. It is hoped that teachers would give children the opportunity to discuss, play, engage with each other, provide logical arguments for different ideas, and find loopholes in arguments presented. This is necessary for the learners to eventually develop the ability to understand what it means to prove something and also become confident about underlying concepts. The mathematics classroom should not expect a blind application of algorithms but should rather encourage children to find many different ways to solve problems. As per the NEP 2020, computational thinking has also been gently introduced through puzzles, games, and interactive exercises that encourage such thinking. Indian rootedness has also been kept in mind while giving contexts for different concepts. The contributions of Indian mathematicians have been given as part of a problem-solving approach to make students aware of India’s rich mathematical heritage and its global contributions to mathematics. The concepts and problems are related to daily life situations. An attempt has been made to use contexts and materials with which the students are familiar. Learning material sheets have been given at the back of the book that may be photocopied and used. At many places, exercises or activities are given to encourage peer group efforts and discussions. The textbook intends to address the learning needs of a diverse group of students in the classroom. We have tried to link concepts learnt in initial chapters with ideas in subsequent chapters to show the connectedness and unity of mathematics. We hope that teachers will use this as an opportunity to revise these concepts in a spiralling way so that children are able to appreciate the entire conceptual structure of mathematics. We hope that teachers may give more time to the ideas of fractions, negative numbers and other notions that are new to students. Many of these are the basis for further learning in mathematics. Finally, this book aims to be more than just a textbook—it’s a passport to a world of mathematical discovery and exploration. Whether used in the classroom or at home, we hope that it may inspire students to embark on their own mathematical adventures, empowering them to see the beauty and relevance of mathematics in everything around them. With its engaging approach and comprehensive coverage of Grade 7 mathematics concepts, this book hopes and aims to captivate young minds and set them on a lifelong journey of mathematical discovery."}

This task calls for providing a fertile environment that allows for the flowering of mathematical thinking in the minds of students. Classrooms, where students just listen and write down whatever is being told to them or written on the board, are deficient in the conditions required for learning mathematics. Instead, classrooms need to be places where students are engaged in playing with mathematical concepts, finding and discussing patterns, and developing creative strategies together to solve problems. Students should also be posing problems to each other and discussing possible solutions with each other. In fact, these are the very conditions that have led to the development of the entire field of mathematics so far, and so one cannot expect students to pick up mathematical thinking and understanding without these conditions. Fortunately, it is not difficult to create such conditions in the classroom. It just requires an interesting question, problem, pattern, or challenge to be thrown open to the students on a regular basis, and sufficient time to be given to them to play with, discuss, and work on it as a class or in pairs or groups. Along with it, an environment that accepts mistakes and acknowledges their importance in learning needs to be nurtured. While creating the spark for initiating mathematical thinking in classrooms is not difficult, sustaining it may be challenging and may involve efforts from your side. Nevertheless, even if just the first part of throwing open a question, problem, pattern, or challenge is done at least once or twice a week, accompanied by sufficient waiting time from your side for students to play, discuss, and work on it, it can have a great positive impact on how the students view and approach mathematics. It should be noted that this positive impact will not happen overnight. That takes time and depends on various factors such as the number of opportunities you give for problem solving, your patience, and the encouragement you give to the students. To support you in posing problems, all the problems or questions in this book are marked using the icon . This icon is an indicator of a potential opportunity to start off a process of problem solving and exploration in the classroom. You will find some of the problems labelled “Math Talk”. Such questions can especially be made as topics for classroom discussion. An owl mascot appears at various points in the textbook to highlight important mathematical processes, ways of thinking, and problem-solving approaches. These can be brought out during classroom discussions, both where the owl is present and also in other similar situations."}
{"class": "class 7", "subject": "maths", "page_no": 12, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "xii To develop students’ mathematical thinking and understanding of concepts, a sufficient number of problems are given. Trying to “cover” all of them must not happen at the cost of students not getting to spend quality time on playing with and discussing them. It is important to understand that the exploratory problems are not only for promoting problem solving skills; they also serve in strengthening procedural fluency when children start engaging in exploration. Efforts must be made in making students independent learners. One essential aspect required for this is an ability to read and understand mathematical text. To promote this skill, students should be encouraged to read the book by themselves and in groups. Give opportunities to them to interpret what they read and express it to others. This will also address the big problem that students face in speaking mathematics and interpreting word problems. This book contains a number of open-ended problems. It also contains new treatments of certain concepts. If you are not able to solve them or follow some of them immediately, it is perfectly okay! Not everyone knows everything. Along with trying to understand and reflect upon such content, it will be very useful to take it to the classroom and open it up for discussion. After the discussion, things that are clear and those that are not yet clear can be clearly summarised. This process itself can throw a lot of light on the content. In these discussions, you can participate as a fellow seeker, and when students see a teacher seek and think to understand something, it sets a wonderful example for them. It is hoped that you and your students will have a great and fruitful time using this book! Summary of Key Points Time for Exploration 1. It is important to routinely pose new problems, questions, patterns, or challenges to the students and give them sufficient time to play with, discuss, and work on them, individually and in groups. 2. During this time, an environment that accepts mistakes and acknowledges their importance in learning needs to be nurtured. 3.

Getting a Feel of Large Numbers You may have come across interesting facts like these: • The world’s tallest statue is the ‘Statue of Unity’ in Gujarat depicting Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. Its height is about 180 metres. • Kunchikal waterfall in Karnataka is said to drop from a height of about 450 metres. It is not always easy to get a sense of how big these measurements are. But, we can get a better sense of their size when we compare them with something familiar. Let us see an example. Look at the picture on the right. Somu is 1 metre tall. If each floor is about four times his height, what is the approximate height of the building? Which is taller — The Statue of Unity or this building? How much taller? ____________m. We can see that the height of the Statue of Unity is close to 4 times the height of Somu’s building. How much taller is the Kunchikal waterfall than Somu's building? ____________m.

Eshwarappa asked Roxie and Estu, “Is a lakh big or small?” Roxie feels that 1 lakh is a large number: • “We had one lakh varieties of rice — that is a lot.” • “Living 1 lakh days would mean living for 274 years — that is a really long time!” • “If 1 lakh people stood shoulder to shoulder in a line they could stretch as far as 38 kilometres.” Estu, however, thinks it is not that big: • “Do you know that the cricket stadium in Ahmedabad has a seating capacity of more than 1 lakh? One lakh people in such a small area!” • “Most humans have 80,000 to 1,20,000 hairs on their heads. Imagine, 1 lakh hairs fit in such a tiny space!” • “I heard that there are some species of fish where a female fish can lay almost one lakh eggs at once very comfortably.

In the American system, the digits are grouped uniformly in a 3-3-3-3… pattern from right to left (thousands, millions, billions, etc.). The Indian system of naming numbers is also followed in Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Maldives, Afghanistan, and Myanmar. The words lakh and crore originate from the Sanskrit words lakṣha (लक्ष) and koṭi (कोटि‍). The American system is also used in many countries. Observe the number of zeroes in 1 lakh and 1 crore. 1 lakh, written in numbers would be 1 followed by 5 zeroes. 1 crore, written in numbers would be 1 followed by 7 zeroes. A lakh is a hundred times a thousand, a crore is a hundred times a lakh and an arab is a hundred times a crore (i.e., a hundred thousand is 1 lakh, 100 lakhs is 1 crore, and 100 crores is 1 arab).

There are situations where it is better to round down (rounding down is when the approximated number is less than the actual number).

Such phrases are called arithmetic expressions. Every arithmetic expression has a value which is the number it evaluates to. For example, the value of the expression 13 + 2 is 15. This expression can be read as ‘13 plus 2’ or ‘the sum of 13 and 2’. We use the equality sign ‘=’ to denote the relationship between an arithmetic expression and its value. For example: 13 + 2 = 15. Example 1: Mallika spends ₹25 every day for lunch at school. Write the expression for the total amount she spends on lunch in a week from Monday to Friday. The expression for the total amount is 5 × 25. 5 × 25 is “5 times 25” or “the product of 5 and 25”. Different expressions can have the same value. Here are multiple ways to express the number 12, using two numbers and any of the four operations +, – , × and ÷: 10 + 2, 15 – 3, 3 × 4, 24 ÷ 2. Choose your favourite number and write as many expressions as you can having that value. Comparing Expressions As we compare numbers using ‘=’, ‘<’ and ‘>’ signs, we can also compare expressions. We compare expressions based on their values and write the ‘equal to’, ‘greater than’ or ‘less than’ sign accordingly. For example, 10 + 2 > 7 + 1 ARITHMETIC EXPRESSIONS 2"}

In such cases, we need some tools and rules to specify how exactly the expression has to be evaluated. To give an example with language, look at the following sentences: (a) Sentence: “Shalini sat next to a friend with toys”. \u0007Meaning: The friend has toys and Shalini sat next to her. (b) \u0007Sentence: “Shalini sat next to a friend, with toys”. Meaning: Shalini has the toys and she sat with them next to her friend. This sentence without the punctuation could have been interpreted in two different ways. The appropriate use of a comma specifies how the sentence has to be understood. Let us see an expression that can be evaluated in more than one way. Example 4: Mallesh brought 30 marbles to the playground. Arun brought 5 bags of marbles with 4 marbles in each bag. How many marbles did Mallesh and Arun bring to the playground? Mallesh summarized this by writing the mathematical expression — 30 + 5 × 4."}
{"class": "class 7", "subject": "maths", "page_no": 45, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "Arithmetic Expressions 27 Without knowing the context behind this expression, Purna found the value of this expression to be 140. He added 30 and 5 first, to get 35, and then multiplied 35 by 4 to get 140. Mallesh found the value of this expression to be 50. He multiplied 5 and 4 first to get 20 and added 20 to 30 to get 50. In this case, Mallesh is right. But why did Purna get it wrong? Just looking at the expression 30 + 5 × 4, it is not clear whether we should do the addition first or multiplication. Just as punctuation marks are used to resolve confusions in language, brackets and the notion of terms are used in mathematics to resolve confusions in evaluating expressions. Brackets in Expressions In the expression to find the number of marbles — 30 + 5 × 4 — we had to first multiply 5 and 4, and then add this product to 30. This order of operations is clarified by the use of brackets as follows: 30 + (5 × 4). When evaluating an expression having brackets, we need to first find the values of the expressions inside the brackets before performing other operations. So, in the above expression, we first find the value of 5 × 4, and then do the addition. Thus, this expression describes the number of marbles: 30 + (5 × 4 ) = 30 + 20 = 50. Example 5: Irfan bought a pack of biscuits for ₹15 and a packet of toor dal for ₹56. He gave the shopkeeper ₹100. Write an expression that can help us calculate the change Irfan will get back from the shopkeeper. Irfan spent ₹15 on a biscuit packet and ₹56 on toor dal. So, the total cost in rupees is 15 + 56. He gave ₹100 to the shopkeeper. So, he should get back 100 minus the total cost. Can we write that expression as— 100 – 15 + 56 ? Can we first subtract 15 from 100 and then add 56 to the result? We will get 141. It is absurd that he gets more money than he paid the shopkeeper! We can use brackets in this case: 100 – (15 + 56). Evaluating the expression within the brackets first, we get 100 minus 71, which is 29. So, Irfan will get back ₹29."}
{"class": "class 7", "subject": "maths", "page_no": 46, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 28 Terms in Expressions Suppose we have the expression 30 + 5 × 4 without any brackets. Does it have no meaning? When there are expressions having multiple operations, and the order of operations is not specified by the brackets, we use the notion of terms to determine the order. Terms are the parts of an expression separated by a ‘+’ sign. For example, in 12+7, the terms are 12 and 7, as marked below. 12 7 + 12 + 7 = We will keep marking each term of an expression as above. Note that this way of marking the terms is not a usual practice. This will be done until you become familiar with this concept. Now, what are the terms in 83 – 14? We know that subtracting a number is the same as adding the inverse of the number. Recall that the inverse of a given number has the sign opposite to it. For example, the inverse of 14 is –14, and the inverse of –14 is 14. Thus, subtracting 14 from 83 is the same as adding –14 to 83. That is, 83 – 14 + 83 – 14 = Thus, the terms of the expression 83 – 14 are 83 and –14. Check if replacing subtraction by addition in this way does not change the value of the expression, by taking different examples. Can you explain why subtracting a number is the same as adding its inverse, using the Token Model of integers that we saw in the Class 6 textbook of mathematics? All subtractions in an expression are converted to additions in this manner to identify the terms. Here are some more examples of expressions and their terms: – 18 – 3 + –18 – 3 = 6 × 5 3 + 6 × 5 + 3 = 2 – 10 + 2 – 10 + 4 × 6 = 4 × 6 + Note that 6 × 5, 4 × 6 are single terms as they do not have any ‘+’ sign. In the following table, some expressions are given. Complete the table. Try This"}

We will start with expressions having only additions (with all the subtractions suitably converted into additions). Does changing the order in which the terms are added give different values? Swapping and Grouping Let us consider a simple expression having only two terms. Example 6: Madhu is flying a drone from a terrace. The drone goes 6 m up and then 4 m down. Write an expression to show how high the final position of the drone is from the terrace. The drone is 6 – 4 = 2 m above the terrace. Writing it as sum of terms: 6 – 4 + 2 = Will the sum change if we swap the terms? – 4 6 + 2 = It doesn’t in this case.

Let us add these terms in the following two different orders: – 7 10 + – 11 + (adding the first two terms and then adding their sum to the third term) – 7 10 + – 11 + (adding the last two terms and then adding their sum to the first term) What do you see?

Take some more expressions and check. Consider expressions with more than 3 terms also. Can you explain why this is happening using the Token Model of integers that we saw in the Class 6 textbook of mathematics? Thus, the addition of terms in any order gives the same value. Therefore, in an expression having only additions, it does not matter in what order the terms are added: they all give the same value. Now let us consider expressions having multiplication and division also, without the order of operations specified by the brackets. The values of such expressions are found by first evaluating the terms. Once all the terms are evaluated, they are added. For example, the expression 30 + 5 × 4 is evaluated as follows: 30 30 5 × 4 20 + + 30 + 5 × 4 = 50 = = The expression 5 × (3 + 2) + 78 + 3 is evaluated as follows: 5 × (3 + 2) 3 + 5 × (3 + 2) + 78 + 3 = + 7 × 8 Where (3+2) is first evaluated and this sum is multiplied by 5 (= 25). The expression 7 × 8 is evaluated (= 56). This simplifies to 25 + 56 + 3 = 84. Manasa is adding a long list of numbers. It took her five minutes to add them all and she got the answer 11749.

To evaluate this expression, we need to subtract 250 – 100 = 150 from 500: 500 – (250 – 100) = 500 – 150 = 350. If we were to directly subtract 250 from 500, then we would have subtracted 100 more than what we needed to. So, we should add back that 100 to 500 – 250 to make the expression take the same value as 500 – (250 – 100). This sequence of operations is 500 – 250+100. Thus, 500 – (250 – 100) = 500 – 250 + 100. Check that 500 – (250 – 100) is not equal to 500 – 250 – 100. Notice again that when the brackets preceded by a negative sign are removed, the signs of the terms inside the brackets change. In this case, the signs of 250 and – 100 change to – 250 and 100. Example 14: Hira has a rare coin collection. She has 28 coins in one bag and 35 coins in another. She gifts her friend 10 coins from the second bag. Write an expression for the number of coins left with Hira. This can be expressed by 28 + (35 – 10). We know that this is the same as 28 + (35 + (–10)). Since the terms can be added in any order, this expression can simply be written as 28 + 35 + (–10), or 28 + 35 – 10. Thus, 28 + (35 – 10) = 28 + 35 – 10 = 53. When the brackets are NOT preceded by a negative sign, the terms within them do not change their signs upon removing the brackets. Notice the sign of the terms 35 and – 10 in the above expression. Rather than simply remembering rules for when to change the sign and when not to, you can figure it out for yourself by thinking about the meanings of the expressions.

This is also the same as paying for two vegetable cutlets and two rasgullas: 2 × 43 + 2 × 24. Therefore, 2 × (43 + 24) = 2 × 43 + 2 × 24. If another friend, Sangmu, joins them and orders the same items, what will be the expression for the total amount to be paid?

The guides march in 3 rows with 5 guides in each row (see the figure below). How many scouts and guides are marching in this parade? The number of boy scouts marching is 4 × 5. The number of girl guides marching is 3 × 5. The total number of scouts and guides will be 4 × 5 + 3 × 5.

Can you explain why? Is 5 × (4 + 3) = 5 × (3 + 4) = (3 + 4) × 5? The observations that we have made in the previous two examples can be seen in a general way as follows. Consider 10 × 98 + 3 × 98. This means taking the sum of 10 times 98 and 3 times 98. 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 10 times 3 times Clearly, this is the same as 10 + 3 = 13 times 98. Thus, 10 × 98 +3 × 98 = (10 + 3) × 98. Writing this equality the other way, we get (10 + 3) 98 = 10 × 98 + 3 × 98. Swapping the numbers in the products above, this property can be seen in the following form: 98 × 10 + 9 × 83 = 98 (10 + 3), and 98 (10 + 3) = 98 × 10 + 98 × 3. Similarly, let us consider the expression 14 × 10 – 6 × 10. This means subtracting 6 times 10 from 14 times 10. 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 14 times Clearly, this is 14 – 6 = 8 times 10. Thus, 14 × 10 – 6 × 10 = (14 – 6) × 10, or (14 – 6) × 10 = 14 × 10 – 6 × 10 This property can be nicely summed up as follows: The multiple of a sum (difference) is the same as the sum (difference) of the multiples.

Yes, we can. The example below compares how the same length is represented when the unit is split into 10 equal parts and when the unit is split into 4 equal parts. If an even more precise measure is needed, each quarter can further be split into four equal parts. Each part then measures 1 16 of a unit, i.e., 16 such parts make 1 unit. Then why split a unit into 10 parts every time? The reason is the special role that 10 plays in the Indian place value system. For a whole number written in the Indian place value system — for example, 281 — the place value of 2 is hundreds (100), that of 8 is tens (10), and that of 4 is one (1). Each place value is 10 times bigger than the one immediately to its right. Equivalently, each place value is 10 times smaller than the one immediately to its left: 10 ones make 1 ten, 10 tens make 1 hundred, 10 hundreds make 1 thousand, and so on. 10,000 1000 100 10 1 × 10 ÷ 10 × 10 ÷ 10 × 10 ÷ 10 × 10 ÷ 10 In order to extend this system of writing numbers to quantities smaller than one, we divide one into 10 equal parts.

Estimating Sums and Differences Sonu has observed sums and differences of decimal numbers and says, “If we add two decimal numbers, then the sum will always be greater than the sum of their whole number parts. Also, the sum will always be less than 2 more than the sum of their whole number parts.” Let us use an example to understand what his claim means: If the two numbers to be added are 25.936 and 8.202, the claim is that their sum will be greater than 25 + 8 (whole number parts) and will be less than 25 + 1 + 8 + 1. What do you think about this claim? Verify if this is true for these numbers. Will it work for any 2 decimal numbers? What about for the sum of 25.93603259 and 8.202? Similarly, come up with a way to narrow down the range of whole numbers within which the difference of two decimal numbers will lie. Note to the Teacher: Estimating the result before computing may help in identifying if a mistake happens with the calculation. 3.8 More on the Decimal System Decimal and Measurement Disasters Decimal point and unit conversion mistakes may seem minor sometimes but they can lead to serious problems.

(1 euro-cent = 1/100 euro). • In 1983, a decimal error nearly caused a disaster for an Air Canada Boeing 767. The ground staff miscalculated the fuel, loading 22,300 pounds instead of kilograms—about half of what was needed (1 pound ~ 0.453 kg). The plane ran out of fuel mid-air, forcing the pilots to make an emergency landing at an abandoned airfield. Fortunately, everyone survived. Several incidents have occurred due to incorrect reading of decimal numbers while giving medication. For example, reading 0.05 mg as 0.5 mg can lead to using a medicine 10 times more than the prescribed quantity. It is therefore important to pay attention to units and the location of the decimal point. Deceptive Decimal Notation Sarayu gets a message: “The bus will reach the station 4.5 hours post noon.” When will the bus reach the station: 4:05 p.m., 4:50 p.m., 4:25 p.m.? None of these! Here, 0.5 hours means splitting an hour into 10 equal parts and taking 5 parts out of it. Each part will be 6 minutes (60 minutes/10) long. 5 such parts make 30 minutes. So, the bus will reach the station at 4:30. Here is a short-story of a decimal mishap: A girl measures the width of an opening as 2 ft 5 inches but conveys to the carpenter to make a door 2.5 ft wide. The carpenter makes a door of width 2 ft 6 inches (since 1 ft = 12 inches, 0.5 ft = 6 inches), and it wouldn’t close fully. I said the door’s width should be 2.5 ft. It is 2.5 ft!

Does this mean 5 overs and 5 balls or 5 overs and 3 balls? Here, 5.5 overs means 5 5 6 overs (as 1 over = 6 balls), i.e., 5 overs and 5 balls. Where else can we see such ‘non-decimals’ with a decimal-like notation? A Pinch of History – Decimal Notation Over Time Decimal fractions (i.e., fractions with denominators like 1 10 , 1 100 , 1 1000 , and so on) are used in the works of a number of ancient Indian astronomers and mathematicians, including in the important 8th century works of Śhrīdharāchārya on arithmetic and algebra. Decimal notation, in essentially its modern form, was described in detail in Kitāb al-Fuṣūl fī al-Ḥisāb al Hindī (The Book of Chapters on Indian Arithmetic) by Abūl Ḥassan al-Uqlīdisī, an Arab mathematician, in around 950 CE. He represented the number 0.059375 as 0ˈ 059375. In the 15th century, to separate whole numbers from fractional parts, a number of different notations were used: • a vertical mark on the last digit of the whole number part (as shown above), • use of different colours and • a numerical superscript giving the number of fractional decimal places (0.36 would be written as 36 2 ). In the 16th century, John Napier, a Scottish mathematician, and Christopher Clavius, a German mathematician, used the point/period (‘.’) to separate the whole number and the fractional parts, while François Viète, a French mathematician, used the comma (‘,’) instead. Currently, several countries use the comma to separate the integer part and the fractional part. In these countries, the number 1,000.5 is written as 1 000,5 (space as a thousand separator). But the decimal point has endured as the most popular notation for writing numbers having fractional parts in the Indian place value system. Figure it Out 1.

We shall see how this helps us in thinking about these relationships and patterns, and in explaining why they may hold true. Example 1: Shabnam is 3 years older than Aftab. When Aftab’s age 10 years, Shabnam’s age will be 13 years. Now Aftab’s age is 18 years, what will Shabnam’s age be? _______ Given Aftab’s age, how will you find out Shabnam’s age? Easy: We add 3 to Aftab’s age to get Shabnam’s age. Can we write this as an expression? Shabnam’s age is 3 years more than Aftab’s. In short, this can be written as: Shabnam’s age = Aftab’s age + 3. Such mathematical relations are generally represented in a shorthand form. In the relation above, instead of writing the phrase ‘Aftab’s Age’, the convention is to use a convenient symbol. Usually, letters or short phrases are used for this purpose. Let us say we use the letter a to denote Aftab’s age (we could have used any other letter), and s to denote Shabnam’s age. Then the expression to find Shabnam’s age will be a + 3, which can be written as s = a + 3. If a is 23 (Aftab’s age in years), then what is Shabnam’s age?

Letters such as a and s that are used to represent numbers are called letter-numbers. Mathematical expressions containing letter-numbers, such as the expression a + 3, are called algebraic expressions. Given the age of Shabnam, write an expression to find Aftab’s age. We know that Aftab is 3 years younger than Shabnam. So, Aftab’s age will be 3 less than Shabnam’s. This can be described as Aftab’s age = Shabnam’s age – 3. If we again use the letter a to denote Aftab’s age and the letter s to denote Shabnam’s age, then the algebraic expression would be: a = s – 3, meaning 3 less than s. Use this expression to find Aftab’s age if Shabnam’s age is 20. Example 2: Parthiv is making matchstick patterns. He repeatedly places Ls next to each other. Each L has two matchsticks as shown in Figure 4.2. Fig. 4.2 How many matchsticks are needed to make 5 Ls? It will be 5 × 2. How many matchsticks are needed to make 7 Ls? It will be 7 × 2. How many matchsticks are needed to make 45 Ls? It will be 45 × 2. \u0007Now, what is the relation between the number of Ls and the number of sticks? First, let us describe the relationship or the pattern here. Every L needs 2 matchsticks. So the number of matchsticks needed will be 2 times the number of L’s. This can be written as: Number of matchsticks = 2 × Number of L’s Now, we can use any letter to denote the number of L’s. Let’s use n. The algebraic expression for the number of matchsticks will be: 2 × n. This expression tells us how many matchsticks are needed to make n L’s. To find the number of matchsticks, we just replace n by the number of L. Example 3: Ketaki prepares and supplies coconut-jaggery laddus.

Many times they could have been read in multiple ways and it was confusing. We used swapping (adding two numbers in any order) and grouping (adding numbers by grouping them conveniently) to find easy ways of evaluating expressions. Swapping and grouping terms does not change the value of the expression. We also learnt to use brackets in expressions, including brackets with a negative sign outside. We learnt the distributive property (multiple of a sum is the same as sum of multiples). Let us revise these concepts and find the values of the following expressions: 1. 23 – 10 × 2 2. 83 + 28 – 13 + 32 3. 34 – 14 + 20 4. 42 + 15 – (8 – 7) 5. 68 – (18 + 13) 6. 7 × 4 + 9 × 6 7. 20 + 8 × (16 – 6) Let us evaluate the first expression, 23 – 10 × 2. First we shall write the terms of the expression. Notice that one of the terms is a number, while the other one has to be converted to a number before adding the two terms. 23 – 10 × 2 = 23 + –10 × 2 = 23 + –20 = 3 w – 1 w 85"}

It has brackets with a negative sign outside. This can be evaluated in two ways — by solving the bracket first (like the solution on the left side) or by removing the brackets appropriately (as on the right side). Now, find the values of the other arithmetic expressions. Algebraic expressions also take number values when the letter- numbers they contain are replaced by numbers. In Example 1, for finding Shabnam’s age when Aftab is 23 years old, we replaced the letter-number a in the expression a + 3 by 23, and it took the value 26. 4.3 \u0007Omission of the Multiplication Symbol in Algebraic Expressions Look at this number sequence: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, ...

{"class": "class 7", "subject": "maths", "page_no": 106, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 As in the previous cases, we will first describe how to get the perimeter when the length and the breadth of the rectangle are known: Find the sum of length + breadth + length + breadth. Let us use the letter-numbers l and b in place of length and breadth respectively. Let p denote the perimeter of the rectangle. Then we have p = l + b + l + b As we know, these represent numbers, and so the terms of an expression can be added in any order. Hence the above expression can be written as: = l + l + b + b As l + l = 2 × l = 2l, and b + b = 2 × b = 2b, we have p = 2l + 2b. Notice that the initial expression (l + b + l + b) and the final expression (2l + 2b) that we got for the perimeter look different. However, they are equal since the expression was obtained from the initial one by applying the same rules and operations we do for numbers; they are equal in the sense that they both take the same values when letter- numbers are replaced by numbers. For example, if we assign l = 3, b = 4, we get l + b + l + b = 3 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 14, and 2l + 2b = 2 × 3 + 2 × 4 = 14. We call the expression 2l + 2b the simplified form of l + b + l + b. Let us see some more examples of simplification. Example 5: Here is a table showing the number of pencils and erasers sold in a shop. The price per pencil is c, and the price per eraser is d. Find the total money earned by the shopkeeper during these three days. Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 Pencils (Price ‘c’) 5 3 10 Erasers (Price ‘d’) 4 6 1 Let us first find the money earned by the sale of pencils. The money earned by selling pencils on Day 1 is 5c.

So in total, the letter-number c is added (5 + 3 + 10) times. This is what we have seen as the distributive property of numbers. Thus, 5 × c + 3 × c + 10 × c = (5 + 3 + 10) × c (5 + 3 + 10) × c can be simplified to 18 × c = 18c. If c = ₹50, find the total amount earned by the scale of pencils. Write the expression for the total money earned by selling erasers. Then, simplify the expression. The expression for the total money earned by selling pencils and erasers during these three days is 18c + 11d. Can the expression 18c + 11d be simplified further? There is no way of further simplifying this expression as it contains different letter-numbers. It is in its simplest form. In this problem, we saw the expression 5c + 3c + 10c getting simplified to the expression 18c. Check that both expressions take the same value when c is replaced by different numbers.

The expression (40x + 75y) – (6x + 10y) is simplified to 34x + 65y, which is the total amount paid in rupees. Could we have written the initial expression as (40x + 75y) + (– 6x – 10y)?

The positions where B occurs are 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, and so on. We can see that the position of the nth appearance of Design B is one less than the position at which Design C appears for the nth time.

Patterns or relationships that are easily written using algebra can often be long and complex in ordinary language. This is one of the advantages of algebra. SUMMARY Math Talk 105"}

Activity 1 Draw two lines on a plain sheet of paper so that they intersect. Measure the four angles formed with a protractor. Draw four such pairs of intersecting lines and measure the angles formed at the points of intersection. What patterns do you observe among these angles? In Fig. 5.2, if ∠a is 120°, can you figure out the measurements of ∠b, ∠c and ∠d, without drawing and measuring them? We know that ∠a and ∠b together measure 180°, because when they are combined, they form a straight angle which measures 180°. So, if ∠a is 120°, then ∠b must be 60°. Similarly, ∠b and ∠c together measure 180°. So, if ∠b is 60°, then ∠c must be 120°. And ∠c and ∠d together measure 180°. So, if ∠c is 120°, then ∠d must be 60°. Therefore, in Fig. 5.2, ∠a and ∠c measure 120°, and ∠b and ∠d measure 60°. When two lines intersect each other and form four angles, labelled a, b, c and d, as in Fig. 5.2, then ∠a and ∠c are equal, and ∠b and ∠d are equal! Is this always true for any pair of intersecting lines? Check this for different measures of ∠a. Using these measurements, can you reason whether this property holds true for any measure of ∠a? We can generalise our reasoning for Fig. 5.2, without assuming the values of ∠a. \u0007Since straight angles measure 180°, we must have ∠a + ∠b = ∠a + ∠d = 180°. Hence, ∠b and ∠d are always equal. Similarly, ∠b + ∠a = ∠b + ∠c = 180°, so ∠a and ∠c must be equal. Adjacent angles, like ∠a and ∠b, formed by two lines intersecting each other, are called linear pairs. Linear pairs always add up to 180°. 107"}

Vertically opposite angles are always equal to each other. From the above reasoning, we conclude that whenever two lines intersect, vertically opposite angles are equal. Such a justification is called a proof in mathematics. Figure it Out List all the linear pairs and vertically opposite angles you observe in Fig. 5.3: Linear Pairs ∠a and ∠b, … Pairs of Vertically Opposite Angles ∠b and ∠d, … Measurements and Geometry You might have noticed that when you measure linear pairs, sometimes they may not add up to 180°. Or, when you measure vertically opposite angles they may be unequal sometimes. What are the reasons for this? There could be different reasons: • Measurement errors because of improper use of measuring instruments — in this case, a protractor • Variation in the thickness of the lines drawn. The “ideal” line in geometry does not have any thickness! But it is not possible for us to draw lines without any thickness In geometry, we create ideal versions of “lines” and other shapes we see around us, and analyse the relationships between them. For example, we know that the angle formed by a straight line is 180°. So, if another line divides this angle into two parts, both parts should add up to 180°. We arrive at this simply through reasoning and not by measurement. When we measure, it might not be exactly so, for the reasons mentioned above. Still the measurements come out very close to what we predict, because of which geometry finds widespread application in different disciplines such as physics, art, engineering and architecture. 5.2 Perpendicular Lines Can you draw a pair of intersecting lines such that all four angles are equal?

In fact, ∠f = ∠b irrespective of the measure of ∠f. Why? Because ∠b is the corresponding angle of ∠f. Similarly, ∠b = ∠d irrespective of the measure of ∠b. Why?

No. Explore what happens to the sum of (a) 4 odd numbers, (b) 5 odd numbers, and (c) 6 odd numbers. Let us go back to the puzzle Kishor was trying to solve. There are 5 empty boxes. That means he has an odd number of boxes. All the number cards contain odd numbers. They should add to 30, which is an even number. Since, adding any 5 odd numbers will never result in an even number, Kishor cannot arrange these cards in the boxes to add up to 30. Two siblings, Martin and Maria, were born exactly one year apart. Today they are celebrating their birthday. Maria exclaims that the sum of their ages is 112. Is this possible? Why or why not? As they were born one year apart, their ages will be (two) consecutive numbers. Can their ages be 51 and 52? 51 + 52 = 103. Try some other consecutive numbers and see if their sum is 112. The counting numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... alternate between even and odd numbers. In any two consecutive numbers, one will always be even and the other will always be odd!

Write a formula to find the nth odd number. Let us first describe the method that we have learnt to find the odd number at a given position: (a) Find the even number at that position. This is 2 times the position number. (b) Then subtract 1 from the even number.

Try solving the problem below. You might have realised that it is not possible to find a solution for this grid. Why is this the case? The smallest sum possible is 6 = 1 + 2 + 3. The largest sum possible is 24 = 9 + 8 + 7. Clearly, any number in a circle cannot be less than 6 or greater than 24. The grid has sums 5 and 26. Therefore, this is impossible! In the earlier grids which we solved, Kishor noticed that the sum of all the numbers in the circles was always 90. Also, Vidya observed that the sum of the circled numbers for all three rows, or for all three columns, was always 45. Check if this is true in the previous grids you have solved. Why should the row sums and column sums always add to 45? From this grid, we can see that all the row sums added together will be the same as the sum of the numbers 1 – 9. This can be seen for column sums as well. The sum of the numbers 1 – 9 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45. A square grid of numbers is called a magic square if each row, each column and each diagonal, add up to the same number. This number is called the magic sum. Diagonals are shown in the picture. Trying to create a magic square by randomly filling the grid with numbers may be difficult! This is because there are a large number of ways of filling a 3 × 3 grid using the numbers 1 – 9 without repetition. In fact, it can be found that there are exactly 3,62,880 such ways. Surprisingly, the number of ways to fill in the grid can be found without listing all of them. We will see in later years how to do this. Instead, we should proceed systematically to make a magic square. For this, let us ask ourselves some questions. 1. What can the magic sum be? Can it be any number? 6 5 21 19 26 11 9 The 3 row sums added together gives 45! So does adding the column sums. 4 7 5 6 1 2 3 9 8 4+6+3 5+2+8 3+9+8 6+1+2 4+7+5 7+1+9 134"}

We have seen that in a 3 × 3 grid with numbers 1 – 9, the total of row sums will always be 45. Since in a magic square the row sums are all equal, and they add up to 45, they have to be 15 each. Thus, we have the following observation. Observation 1: In a magic square made using the numbers 1 – 9, the magic sum must be 15. 2. What are the possible numbers that could occur at the centre of a magic square? Let us consider the possibilities one by one. Can the central number be 9? If yes, then 8 must come in one of the other squares. For example, In this, we must have 8 + 9 + other number = 15. But this is not possible! The same issue will occur no matter where we place 8. So, 9 cannot be at the centre. Can the central number be 1? If yes, then 2 should come in one of the other squares. Here, we must have 2 + 1 + other number = 15. But this is not possible because we are only using the numbers 1 – 9. The same issue will occur no matter where we place 1. So, 1 cannot be at the centre, either. Using such reasoning, find out which other numbers 1 – 9 cannot occur at the centre. This exploration will lead us to the following interesting observation. Observation 2: The number occurring at the centre of a magic square, filled using 1 – 9, must be 5. Let us now see where the smallest number 1 and the largest number 9 should come in a magic square. Our second observation tells us that they will have to come in one of the boundary positions. Let us classify these positions into two categories: 8 9 1 2 5 135"}

The Virahāṅka–Fibonacci Numbers thus provide a beautiful illustration of the close links between Art, Science, and Mathematics. Discovery of the Virahāṅka Numbers The Virahāṅka numbers first came up thousands of years ago in the works of Sanskrit and Prakrit linguists in their study of poetry! In the poetry of many Indian languages, including, Prakrit, Sanskrit, Marathi, Malayalam, Tamil, and Telugu, each syllable is classified as either long or short. A long syllable is pronounced for a longer duration than a short syllable — in fact, for exactly twice as long. When singing such a poem, a short syllable lasts one beat of time, and a long syllable lasts two beats of time. This leads to numerous mathematical questions, which the ancient poets in these languages considered extensively. A number of important mathematical discoveries were made in the process of asking and answering these questions about poetry. One of these particularly important questions was the following. How many rhythms are there with 8 beats consisting of short syllables (1 beat) and long syllables (2 beats)? That is, in how many ways can one 27 20 25 22 24 26 23 28 21 139"}

Phrased more mathematically: In how many different ways can one write a number, say 8, as a sum of 1’s and 2’s? For example, we have: 8 = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2, 8 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1, 8 = 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2, 8 = 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2, etc. Do you see other ways?

The reason this method works is that every 5-beat rhythm must begin with either a ‘1+’ or a ‘2+’. If it begins with a ‘1+’, then the remaining numbers must give a 4-beat rhythm, and we can write all those down. If it begins with a 2+, then the remaining number must give a 3-beat rhythm, and we can write all those down. Therefore, the number of 5-beat rhythms is the number of 4-beat rhythms, plus the number of 3-beat rhythms. How many 6-beat rhythms are there? By the same reasoning, it will be the number of 5-beat rhythms plus the number of 4-beat rhythms, i.e., 8 + 5 = 13. Thus, there are 13 rhythms having 6 beats. Use the systematic method to write down all 6-beat rhythms, i.e., write 6 as the sum of 1’s and 2’s in all possible ways. Did you get 13 ways? This beautiful method for counting all the rhythms of short syllables and long syllables having any given number of beats was first given by the great Prakrit scholar Virahāṅka around the year 700 CE. He gave his method in the form of a Prakrit poem! For this reason, the sequence 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, . . . is known as the Virahāṅka sequence, and the numbers in the sequence are known as the Virahāṅka numbers. Virahāṅka was the first known person in history to explicitly consider these important numbers and write down the rule for their formation. Other scholars in India also considered these numbers in the same poetic context. Virahāṅka was inspired by earlier work of the legendary Sanskrit scholar Piṅgala, who lived around 300 BCE. After Virahāṅka, these numbers were also written about by Gopala (c. 1135 CE) and then by Hemachandra (c. 1150 CE). In the West, these numbers have been known as the Fibonacci numbers, after the Italian mathematician who wrote about them in the year 1202 CE — about 500 years after Virahāṅka. As we can see, Fibonacci was not first, nor the second, not even the third person to write about these numbers! Sometimes the term “Virahāṅka–Fibonacci numbers” is used so that everyone understands what is being referred to. So, how many rhythms of short and long syllables are there having 8 beats? We simply take the 8th element of the Virahāṅka sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ... Thus, there are 34 rhythms having 8 beats. 141"}

Can one construct triangles having any given sidelengths? Are there lengths for which it is impossible to construct a triangle? Let us explore this. Construct a triangle with sidelengths 3 cm, 4 cm, and 8 cm. What is happening? Are you able to construct the triangle? Here is another set of lengths: 2 cm, 3 cm, and 6 cm. Check if a triangle is possible for these sidelengths. Try to find more sets of lengths for which a triangle construction is impossible. See if you can find any pattern in them. We see that a triangle is possible for some sets of lengths and not possible for others. How do we check if a triangle exists for a given set of lengths? One way is to actually try to construct the triangle and check if it is possible. Is there a more efficient way to check this? Triangle Inequality Consider the lengths 10 cm, 15 cm and 30 cm. Does there exist a triangle having these as sidelengths? To tackle this question, let us study a property of triangles. Imagine a small plot of plain land having a tent, a tree, and a pole. Imagine you are at the entrance of the tent and want to go to the tree. Which is the shorter path: (i) the straight-line path to the tree (the red path) or (ii) the straight-line path from the tent to the pole, followed by the straight-line path from the pole to the tree (the yellow path)?

Did you spot any other type of triangle? The classification of triangles as equilateral and isosceles was based on equality of sides. Equilateral triangles have sides of equal length. Isosceles triangles have two sides of equal length. Scalene triangles have sides of three different lengths. Can a similar classification be done based on equality of angles? Is there any relation between these two classifications? We will answer these questions in a later chapter. We used angle measures when classifying a triangle as a right- angled triangle. What are the other types of triangles based on angle measures? A classification of triangles based on their angle measures is acute- angled, right-angled and obtuse-angled triangles. We have already seen what a right-angled triangle is. It is a triangle with one right angle. Similarly, an obtuse-angled triangle has one obtuse angle. What could an acute-angled triangle be?

She used 1 4 litre of milk for this. How much milk is there in each cup of tea? Leena used 1 4 litres of milk in 5 cups of tea. So, in 1 cup of tea the volume of milk should be: 1 4 ÷ 5. Writing this as multiplication, we have: 5 × (milk per cup) = 1 4. We perform the division as follows as per Brahmagupta’s method: The reciprocal of 5 (the divisor) is 1 5. Multiplying this reciprocal by the dividend ( 1 4 ), we get 1 5 × 1 4 = 1 20. So, each cup of tea has 1 20 litre of milk. Example 4: Some of the oldest examples of working with non-unit fractions occur in humanity’s oldest geometry texts, the Śhulbasūtra. Here is an example from Baudhāyana’s Śhulbasūtra (c. 800 BCE).

Each square brick has an area of 1 5 × 1 5 = 1 25 square units. The total area to be covered is 7 1 2 sq. units = 15 2 sq. units. As (Number of bricks) × (Area of a brick) = Total Area, Number of bricks = 15 2 ÷ 1 25. The reciprocal of the divisor is 25. Multiplying the reciprocal by the dividend, we get 25 × 15 2 = 25 × 15 2 = 375 2 . Example 5: This problem was posed by Chaturveda Pṛithūdakasvāmī (c. 860 CE) in his commentary on Brahmagupta’s book Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta. Four fountains fill a cistern. The first fountain can fill the cistern in a day. The second can fill it in half a day. The third can fill it in a quarter of a day. The fourth can fill the cistern in one fifth of a day. If they all flow together, in how much time will they fill the cistern? Let us solve this problem step by step. In a day, the number of times — • the first fountain will fill the cistern is 1÷ 1 = 1 • the second fountain will fill the cistern is 1 ÷ 1 2 = _____ • the third fountain will fill the cistern is 1 ÷ 1 4= _____ • the fourth fountain will fill the cistern is 1 ÷ 1 5 = _____ The number of times the four fountains together will fill the cistern in a day is ___ + ____ + ___ + ____ = 12. Thus, the total time needed by the four fountains to fill the cistern together is 1 12 days. 191"}

A Dramma-tic Donation The following problem is translated from Bhāskarāchārya’s (Bhāskara II’s) book, Līlāvatī, written in 1150 CE. “O wise one! A miser gave to a beggar 1 5 of 1 16 of 1 4 of 1 2 of 2 3 of 3 4 of a dramma. If you know the mathematics of fractions well, tell me O child, how many cowrie shells were given by the miser to the beggar.” Dramma refers to a silver coin used in those times. The tale says that 1 dramma was equivalent to 1280 cowrie shells. Let’s see what fraction of a dramma the person gave: ( 1 2 × 2 3 × 3 4 × 1 5 × 1 16 × 1 4) th part of a dramma. 193"}

Upon simplifying to its lowest form, we get 6 7680 = 1 1280. So, one cowrie shell was given to the beggar. You can see in the answer Bhāskarāchārya’s humour! The miser had given the beggar only one coin of the least value (cowrie). Around the 12th century, several types of coins were in use in different kingdoms of the Indian subcontinent. Most commonly used were gold coins (called dinars/gadyanas and hunas), silver coins (called drammas/tankas), copper coins (called kasus/panas and mashakas), and cowrie shells. The exact conversion rates between these coins varied depending on the region, time period, economic conditions, weights of coins and their purity. Gold coins had high-value and were used in large transactions and to store wealth. Silver coins were more commonly used in everyday transactions. Copper coins had low-value and were used in smaller transactions. Cowrie shells were the lowest denomination and were used in very small transactions and as change. If we assume 1 gold dinar = 12 silver drammas, 1 silver dramma = 4 copper panas, 1 copper pana = 6 mashakas, and 1 pana = 30 cowrie shells, 1 copper pana = 1 48 gold dinar ( 1 12 × 1 4) 1 cowrie shell =____ copper panas 1 cowrie shell =____ gold dinar. A Pinch of History As you have seen, fractions are an important type of number, playing a critical role in a variety of everyday problems that involve sharing and dividing quantities equally. The general notion of non-unit fractions as we use them today — equipped with the arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — developed largely in India. The ancient Indian geometry texts called the Śhulbasūtra — which go back as far as 800 BCE, and were concerned with the construction of fire altars for rituals — used general non-unit fractions extensively, including performing division of such fractions as we saw in Example 3. Fractions even became commonplace in the popular culture of India as far back as 150 BCE, as evidenced by an offhand reference to the reduction of fractions to lowest terms in the philosophical work of the revered Jain scholar Umasvati. 194"}

We have already seen his methods for adding and subtracting general fractions. For multiplying general fractions, Brahmagupta wrote: “Multiplication of two or more fractions is obtained by taking the product of the numerators divided by the product of the denominators.” (Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta, Verse 12.1.3) That is, a b × c d = a × c b × d . For division of general fractions, Brahmagupta wrote: “The division of fractions is performed by interchanging the numerator and denominator of the divisor; the numerator of the dividend is then multiplied by the (new) numerator, and the denominator by the (new) denominator.” Bhāskara II in his book Līlāvatī in 1150 CE clarifies Brahmagupta‘s statement further in terms of the notion of reciprocal: “Division of one fraction by another is equivalent to multiplication of the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second.” (Līlāvatī, Verse 2.3.40) Both of these verses are equivalent to the formula: a b ÷ c d = a b ×d c = a × d b × c . Bhāskara I, in his 629 CE commentary Āryabhaṭīyabhāṣhya on Aryabhata’s 499 CE work, described the geometric interpretation of multiplication of fractions (that we saw earlier) in terms of the division of a square into rectangles via equal divisions along the length and breadth. Many other Indian mathematicians, such as Śhrīdharāchārya (c. 750 CE), Mahāvīrāchārya (c. 850 CE), Caturveda Pṛithūdakasvāmī (c. 860 CE), and Bhāskara II (c. 1150 CE) developed the usage of arithmetic of fractions significantly further. The Indian theory of fractions and arithmetic operations on them was transmitted to, and its usage developed further, by Arab and African mathematicians such as al-Hassâr (c. 1192 CE) of Morocco. The theory was then transmitted to Europe via the Arabs over the next few Bhāskara I’s visual explanation that 1 5 x 1 4 = 1 20 1 20 1 5 1 4 195"}
