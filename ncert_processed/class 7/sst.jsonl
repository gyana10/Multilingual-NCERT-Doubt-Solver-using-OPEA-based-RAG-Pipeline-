At the same time, it aims to prepare the students to engage constructively with the opportunities and challenges of the 21st century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. By nurturing students’ inherent abilities across all the five planes of human existence, (pañchakośhas), the Foundational and the Preparatory Stages set the stage for the further learning at Middle Stage. Spanning Grade 6 to Grade 8, the Middle Stage serves as a critical three year bridge between the Preparatory and Secondary Stages. The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages — including at least two languages native to India — to Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas, as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy — a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, and practising"}

The Social Science textbook for Grade 7 — Exploring Society: India and Beyond Part 1 — has been prepared for the second year of the middle stage. It carries forward the themes and approach of Grade 6; the focus is on core concepts and major developments. It endeavours to keep the students engaged in learning through illustrations, maps and pictures laid out in an attractive design. There are abundant reflective exercises and activities embedded in the text to support exploration, discovery and meaning-making. The thematic approach with a multidisciplinary lens continues, helping students to understand ideas and concepts holistically. The text integrates the values we desire our students to develop, is rooted in the Indian cultural context and introduces global perspectives in an age-appropriate manner. For all practical purposes, it has, to my mind, succeeded in its curricular goals: first, to foster natural curiosity among students through a proper selection of content, and second, through a pedagogical approach in line with the recommendations of NCF-SE 2023. However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years.

In Social Science, this year we will further explore about our country, India, across all the five themes we began with last year. You will also get glimpses of our interactions with the rest of the world in the past as well as the present. As you are older now, there will be a little more independent reading, writing and doing. This year too we have tried to keep the text to a minimum — the book has lots of colourful maps, pictures and illustrations. Since good education should promote understanding and reflection, we have created opportunities for you to explore, discover, think, create, ask questions and propose answers. Look for the ways in which each theme brings together multiple inputs from several disciplines — whether history, geography, political science or economics. This brings us closer to real life and helps us understand the events of today better. Finally, we will start exploring some of the people, places and ideas that strengthened India’s foundations, as well as delve into some of the aspects of society today. You will observe that the threads of the past continue to be part of today’s tapestry and give us the design for strengthening it for tomorrow. A number of people put their hearts and heads in the preparation of this textbook. It has given us all great joy, and we offer it to you with the hope you will experience some of this joy when you discover new horizons or figure out an original answer to some of the challenging questions we sometimes like to throw at you! We need to add an important detail. In this textbook, every part of it — text, side box, image or map — can be subject to evaluation and assessment. There are however four exceptions:"}

But we will also encounter some words in Sanskrit and a few other Indian languages. The Roman alphabet cannot make their pronunciation clear without some additional marks or signs, such as dashes, dots or accents, called ‘diacritical signs’ or ‘diacritics’. You can ignore all these signs if you wish, and you don’t need to remember them. However, as we are using only a few simple signs, you will find it easy to get used to them. You will also find that they help you pronounce Sanskrit words fairly correctly. Here is how they work:  A short dash (called ‘macron’) over a vowel makes it long. For instance, dāna is pronounced ‘daana’; līlā is pronounced ‘leelaa’; sūtra is sootra.  śh and ṣh are pronounced more or less as ‘sh’ in ‘shall’ (there is a slight difference, since they correspond to श and ष in the Devanagari script, but you can ignore it in practice). So śhāstra is pronounced ‘shaastra’; kṣhīra is ‘ksheera’.  Consonants with a dot below them (ḍ, ṭ and ṇ mainly) are ‘hard’, i.e. pronounced by hitting the tongue on the palate; without a dot, they are soft, with the tongue on the teeth. (As a rough comparison, in the preceding English word ‘teeth’, the first ‘t’ is hard, while the final ‘th’ is soft.) Examples of hard consonants: Āryabhaṭa, gaṇa, paṭhana (studying), pīṭha, goṣṭhī (association, assembly), dhanāḍhya (rich), aṇu (atom)."}

We choose to write it as ṛi, although in some parts of India it is also pronounced as ṛu. So we write ‘Ṛig Veda’, for instance.

When she asked him, “How does India look from space?”, he replied, “Sāre jahān se achchha” — better than the whole world. (This is the title of a well-known poem of the early 20th century.) LET’S EXPLORE Look at the map of India at the end of this book. What are you able to observe? Recall your lesson on different types of landforms — mountains, plains and plateaus. Which landforms can you identify on the map? What do the different colours on the map mean? (Hint: The legend on the map shows the heights of each area.) As you go through this chapter, remember to refer periodically to the physical map. India is the seventh-largest country in the world, and a part of Asia. Along with its neighbours — Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar — it forms the region known as the Indian Subcontinent (subcontinent, since it is part of the continent of Asia). Often, for the purpose of discussion, we refer to five regions — the great mountain zone, the plains of the Ganga and the Indus, the desert region, the southern peninsula, and the islands. In this chapter, we will ‘fly’ over these zones, providing you with a bird’s-eye view of these features and offering glimpses of what things look like in close-up at some of these places. It would be difficult to go into all the details at this stage since, as you will soon see, India is large and diverse. The Himalayan Mountain range stands as a natural barrier in the north, while the Thar Desert and the Arabian Sea mark its western limits. To the south, the Indian Ocean and to the east, the Bay of Bengal form a natural boundary. These geographical features create a separation between India and the rest of the continent and have played a crucial role in shaping India’s climate, culture, and history."}

These rivers and their tributaries provide water for drinking, farming, and industrial use, connecting with the lives of hundreds of millions of people. Hence, the Himalayas are sometimes called the ‘Water Tower of Asia’. The Himalayas are also important to many cultures and belief systems.

As India pushed against Eurasia, the land between them crumpled and rose up — just like how a carpet wrinkles when you push it. That’s how the mighty Himalayan mountains were formed! Amazingly, India is still pushing into Asia today, very slowly — about five centimetres each year, which is much slower than the rate at which your hair grows. This means the Himalayas are still growing taller, just a tiny bit each year — about five millimetres, but over a millennium, that adds up to five metres! Fig. 1.4.

What is weather? Weather is a state of the Earth’s atmosphere at a particular time and place. But what is an atmosphere? In simple terms, it is the layer of gases that surround some planets — in the case of our Earth, we call these gases ‘air’. The Earth’s atmosphere may be compared to a cake with several layers. The layer closest to the surface of the Earth is called the ‘troposphere’, and that is where all land-based plants and animals (including humans!) live and breathe. It is also where almost all weather phenomena, which we will explore in this chapter, take place. The troposphere extends to a height of 6 to 18 kilometres from the ground; it is less thick at the poles (where the cold air contracts) and thicker in the tropical zone (where the warmer air expands). You will study more about the other layers in your Science classes. We use many words to describe the weather — hot, cold, rainy, cloudy, humid, snowy, windy, and so on.

(Hint: Think how knowing the weather a few hours or a few days in advance would help you plan some activities.) From early times, humans have closely observed Nature and learnt to read her signals to forecast the weather. Observing birds flying low, ants carrying eggs, squirrels gathering nuts, frogs croaking loudly, or even the opening and closing of pine cones, provided valuable information about coming rain or storms. This knowledge has been passed down from generation to generation. Even today, in many parts of India, people use traditional ways to predict the weather, especially the arrival of the monsoon.

Do they just look up at the sky and guess? No, they’ve got some cool gadgets, a few of which we will now look at. Meteorology: Meteorology is the systematic study of weather and its evolution. This study is the basis for weather forecasting. Fig. 2.3.1. Ants shifting their eggs to higher ground is a natural behaviour that indicates an expected change in the weather, especially heavy rain.

Some simply measure the ambient temperature; others record the maximum and minimum temperatures during a day. Thermometers often use a coloured liquid which expands when the temperature increases. However, more and more, digital thermometers are preferred as they are more precise and can record more data. Indeed, temperature recordings can be used to collect some useful statistics, including:  Range of temperature or the maximum temperature minus the minimum temperature during a particular period of time (usually 24 hours).  Mean daily temperature or the maximum temperature plus the minimum temperature of the day divided by two.

But you may also have experienced that the weather sometimes feels ‘heavy’, as before a thunderstorm. This is related to atmospheric pressure, which is the pressure exerted by the weight of the air above and around us. The atmospheric pressure is higher near the sea coast and lower as we go higher up into the mountains. When you climb a mountain, the air gets thinner than in the plain below. As a result, the air pressure is lower, and there is less oxygen available for lower pressure (cooler air) higher pressure (warmer air) Fig. 2.7"}

With less oxygen getting into your blood, your body has to work harder to keep you moving! That’s why people sometimes feel breathless, dizzy or tired at high altitudes. This does not mean that the atmospheric pressure is always high in the plains below or on the coast. In fact, it sometimes drops dramatically, resulting in what meteorologists call a ‘depression’ or ‘low-pressure system’, which can sometimes develop into a storm or even a cyclone. THINK ABOUT IT Why do you think it would be important to measure atmospheric pressure? Who are the people most likely to use such measurements? The instrument used to measure atmospheric pressure is called a barometer. As with thermometers, there are several types of barometers. The unit they display is generally the millibar (abbreviated as mb). The normal atmospheric pressure at the sea coast is around 1013 mb; a pressure below 1000 mb indicates a depression. THINK ABOUT IT ​People who journey to places at a high altitude are advised to make pauses on the way to allow the body to acclimatise. Our army personnel serve in high-altitude places like Khardung la in Ladakh, which is over 5600 metres above sea level.

Speed and direction are two important factors when we describe the wind. THINK ABOUT IT Have you seen seeds like these flying in the wind? What would happen to the seeds if there was no wind? The wind is an important element of the weather. Its direction and speed help in weather forecasting. Besides, air pilots and sailors need to be aware of wind data, as the wind has a great influence on flying or sailing. Farmers also use the wind direction to predict where rain might come from. Also, a greater wind speed will cause the soil to dry faster. So, how do we measure this direction and speed? A wind vane (or weather vane) has a rotating arm with a pointer at one end and a tail at the other. When the wind blows, the tail is pushed, and the pointer turns in the direction of the wind. It responds even to a light breeze. Fig. 2.9"}

Similar socks are used in industries that release ash or gases. The simplest instrument to measure the wind direction and speed is the anemometer. It has three or four metal cups that rotate on a vertical shaft when the wind blows — the stronger the wind, the faster the rotation. A meter attached at the bottom counts how many times the anemometer spins in a certain period of time and calculates the wind speed in kilometres per hour (km/h). e) Humidity Humidity is the last element of the weather on our list. It refers to the amount of water vapour present in the air. It also depends on factors like temperature, wind, pressure and location.

Before we move forward, we need to remember our Science lesson from Grade 6 about the states of water. This will help us to understand how humidity is measured. LET’S REMEMBER Æ When water evaporates, it causes a cooling effect. Æ If the amount of water in the air is already high (more humidity), water evaporates slowly. That is typically the case on a rainy day. Humidity of the air is measured as relative humidity: air that would contain absolutely no water vapour (which is impossible in natural conditions) is rated at 0%, while air saturated with water vapour will have a humidity of 100%. In practice, dry weather has a relative humidity range between 20% and 40%, while humid weather usually falls between 60% and 80% relative humidity. THINK ABOUT IT If the humidity in Delhi is at 52% while in Kochi it is 84%, in which of the two places are wet clothes likely to dry faster? And where are you likely to sweat more, assuming the temperature is the same in both places? But how do we measure such numbers? This is done through an instrument called a hygrometer. Again, there are several types of hygrometers, depending on the principle they are based on. The measurement of humidity is of great importance in many industrial processes, such as food processing.

But, quite often, what they really mean is ‘weather’, and not ‘climate’. What’s the difference? ‘Weather’ is what we experience every hour or day: it might be raining, or there could be bright sunshine, a lot of wind, etc. The weather keeps changing. Climate, on the other hand, is the pattern of weather an area or a region experiences over a long period of time — several decades at least. This pattern varies from region to region. Before we come to the various types of climates, let us briefly stop to introduce seasons. Seasons occur as the Earth revolves around the Sun. Each season lasts for a few months and recurs every year. As we know, there are several seasons in the year — spring, summer, monsoon, autumn and winter — that occur in a cycle. Are seasons related to the weather or to the climate? The answer is: to both. The weather changes with the season, that is, it can be dry and hot in the summer months, or humid and rainy during the monsoon. Further, the pattern of seasons in a region is closely connected with the climate. There are four main seasons across most regions of the world — spring, summer, autumn and winter. However, India receives rainfall during a specific period of the year — the ‘rainy season’ or monsoon — along with the other four. Traditionally, in many parts of India, the year is divided into six seasons or ṛitus — vasanta (spring), grīṣhma (summer), varṣhā (rainy season), śharad (autumn), hemanta (pre-winter), śhiśhir (winter). Specific rituals and festivals are associated with these six ṛitus, such as Vasanta Pañchamī or Śharad Pūrṇima. Fig. 3.2"}

This is equally true of its climate:  In the north, the Himalayan mountains have an alpine climate with cold, snowy winters and cool summers (the word ‘alpine’ comes from the Alps, a mountain range of Europe). That’s probably where you will see the thickest clothing in India!  Lower in the Himalayas, and in many hilly areas of India, the climate is often said to be temperate, as the winters are moderately cold and the summers not too hot. That is where we find many ‘hill stations’, much frequented by people seeking relief from the heat in the plains below.  In the northern plains, the climate is subtropical, with very hot summers and cold winters. This is where most of India’s wheat is grown.  In the west, the Thar Desert has an arid climate featuring extremely hot days, cool nights, and very little rainfall. People there have had to develop unique ways to collect and save water.  The western coastal strip receives heavy rainfall during monsoon months, creating a tropical wet climate, which is favourable to the growing of rice and spices.  The central Deccan Plateau has a semi-arid climate with hot summers, mild winters and moderate rainfall during the rainy season.  Eastern India and the southern peninsula experience a tropical climate with a mild winter and distinct wet and dry periods controlled by monsoon winds (more on them soon).

There are many factors at work. Some are general ones — on the scale of the planet — while others are regional or even local. Let’s examine a few. a) Latitude LET’S REMEMBER We studied about latitudes in Grade 6. Do you remember that latitudes measure the distance from the Equator, increasing as we move away from it (either northward or southward)? While the climate around the Equator is extremely hot, as the latitude increases it becomes temperate and then cold or frigid. Why is this so? Places near the Equator, that is, at low latitudes, are warmer, while those near the poles (high latitudes) are colder. This happens due to the angle at which the sun’s rays hit a particular area. At the Equator, the rays are nearly perpendicular, and so all their energy is focused on a smaller area of the Earth’s surface. In the polar regions, the rays are inclined or oblique, and the energy is distributed over a larger surface. Moreover, they have to pass through more of the Earth’s atmosphere, as the diagram shows, which further dissipates their energy. As a result, the polar regions receive less heat than the equatorial zone. We can see this in India too: Kanniyakumari and the Nicobar Islands being close to the Equator are warm or hot almost throughout the year, whereas places in the north, such as Srinagar, are much cooler. Solar radiation Atmosphere At the equator exposure to the sun’s rays is concentrated, but near the poles it is dispersed over a wide area Fig. 3.4"}

India has many including Munnar, Theni, Udhagamandalam (Ooty), Madikeri, Mahabaleshwar, Mount Abu, Shimla, Nainital, Darjeeling, Tawang, Shillong, etc. We know they are located at a higher altitude than the plains below, but how does that explain their cooler temperature? You will later learn the full answer in your Science classes. To keep things simple for now, the temperature decreases as the altitude increases because: 1. The atmospheric pressure, and therefore the air density, decreases as the altitude increases (as we saw in the chapter ‘Understanding the Weather’), and as the air gets less dense, it gets cooler. 2. The sun heats the surface of the Earth, and so the farther away from the surface, the less hot the air will be. The Himalayas are so high that many peaks maintain a temperature below water’s freezing point, keeping them covered in snow. Udhagamandalam (Ooty) Shimla Darjeeling Munnar Fig. 3.5"}

The range of summer temperatures in Ooty is 10–25° while that in Coimbatore is 25 –38°. Why do you think there is such a difference in temperature between these two places? c) Proximity to the sea Temperatures in coastal areas do not vary much; the summers are not too hot and the winters are not too cold. That is because the sea acts as a moderator for the temperature. This diagram sums up the phenomenon, and your Science textbook explains this further while discussing the heating and cooling of land and water in coastal regions. The result is that those regions tend to be more temperate. As you move inland from the coast, the temperatures get more extreme — summer temperatures will be higher and winter temperatures lower. For instance, Mumbai and Nagpur are located at a similar latitude, but Mumbai, being near the sea, has cooler summers (around 32°C) and milder winters (around 18°C), while Nagpur, away from the coast, experiences up to 44°C in summer and about 10°C in winter. As you can see, Mumbai’s range of temperature (i.e. the difference between the maximum and the minimum) is about 14°C while the range at Nagpur reaches 34°C.

States like Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh often receive winds blowing from the west. Having travelled over the deserts of Arabia to Afghanistan, they bring dry and hot air that causes severe heat waves in summer. In winter cold winds from across the Himalayas creep into the Himalayan foothills, resulting in cold waves. Winds affect not only temperature, but also humidity, and in turn, precipitation. We saw dry winds coming from distant deserts; in contrast, winds coming from the sea bring moisture over the land, which may result in rainfall. We will soon see the case of the monsoon winds.

Describing the climate involves a description of the patterns of temperature, precipitation (rain or snowfall, occurrence of fog or mist) and wind conditions in a region over three decades or more. A microclimate is a climate localised in a small area, which differs from the climate in the surrounding region. It has a unique pattern of temperature, humidity, precipitation, etc., in a small geographical area. For instance, enclosed valleys and some forests have micro- climates of their own. So do ‘urban heat islands’, that is, some cities that have a large number of buildings and other concrete structures and very little vegetation; all this traps the heat and they are often much warmer than the surrounding region. Microclimates can influence the local flora and fauna, the crops grown, and impact human health and well-being. Fig. 3.8. Aravallis and urban heat islands"}

During the monsoon months, the rivers fill up, the soil is soaked with water, crops grow and life thrives. Strictly speaking, the word ‘monsoon’, which comes from the Arabic word mausim, meaning ‘season’, refers to seasonal winds over a large area of the Indian Ocean and surrounding regions, including Australia, Africa and South Asia. There is a yearly pattern to the monsoons. Their mechanism is complex, but based on the simple fact that land heats up or cools down faster than the ocean. Monsoons bring out the fundamental relationship between temperature, pressure and wind movement. To put it simply, as summer begins, the Asian landmass heats up, creating a powerful low-pressure system over it. Since air always flows from high pressure to low pressure, winds are drawn from the cooler, high-pressure ocean towards the hot land. These ocean winds carry moisture that condenses over the warmer land and falls in the form of heavy monsoon rains. (That is why ‘monsoon’ commonly refers to the seasonal rains rather than the winds.) Equator Africa Arabia southwest monsoon India Equator Africa Arabia northeast monsoon India B. Winter The pattern reverses in winter, when the landmass cools down more rapidly than the ocean. Now the land has a high-pressure system while the ocean remains warmer with relatively lower pressure.

This is commonly called the summer or southwest monsoon (‘southwest’ reflecting the direction the winds come from). As winter approaches, the winds reverse and blow from the land to the ocean, as we just saw.

When the low- pressure system is intense and the wind speeds are high, this may result in a cyclone. As winds collect moisture, they form clouds and rotate inwards towards the centre of the depression. This centre, which is cloudless, is called ‘the eye of the cyclone’.

In the Earth’s natural carbon cycle, carbon dioxide (CO2) and other gases are released gradually into the atmosphere and trap heat from the Sun. This natural ‘greenhouse effect’ warms Earth enough to support life. However, human activities like industry, transportation, and agriculture have released enormous amounts of these ‘greenhouse gases’ in just a few centuries. This sudden increase traps extra heat, causing rapid global warming and disrupting the climate patterns that plants, animals, and human societies have adapted to over thousands of years. In India, rising temperatures are perceptible in many regions. Early in 2025, for instance, the country’s average temperature was 1 to 3°C above normal, as a result of which the winter was much shorter and milder than usual. This affects not only agricultural production but also many small-scale industries. This is only one example showing how a warmer planet will present us with increasing challenges. Understanding the relationship between the causes of climate change and disasters can help us to prepare better for these challenges. It also supports the need for more environment- friendly practices and building resilience and adaptation in communities. Governments worldwide, including India’s, attempt to promote measures of climate mitigation, such as cutting down on greenhouse gas emissions, planting trees, boosting renewable energy and improving energy efficiency, promoting sustainable lifestyles, etc. But these often clash with a desire for economic growth and increased consumption.

Some of its cities were abandoned; in others, some people continued living there, but reverting to a rural or village lifestyle. They had to, since all the components of the Harappan urban order had disappeared: elaborate structures, both private and public; crowded streets and busy markets; different communities with specialised occupations (metalsmiths, potters, builders, weavers, craftspeople, and so on); a writing system; a sanitation system; the presence of an administration; and, behind it all, a larger state structure with a ruling class at the head.

How do we know this? Mainly from two sources: (1) archaeological excavations that have confirmed the existence of those ancient urban centres, and (2) ancient literature describing them — late Vedic, Buddhist and Jain literatures are full of references to these new urban centres. This new phase is often called India’s ‘Second Urbanisation’ — which, incidentally, has continued right up to today! Let us see how this phase emerged. Janapadas and Mahājanapadas Towards the end of the 2nd millennium BCE, regional cultures gradually reorganised themselves in north India. As people formed clans or groups, probably sharing a common language and common customs, each clan came to be associated with a territory or janapada led by a rājā or ruler. (‘Janapada’ is a Sanskrit word which means ‘where the people (jana) have set foot (pada),’ that is, have settled down.) The janapadas grew as trade networks expanded and connected them. By the 8th or 7th centuries BCE, some of those early states had merged together; the resulting bigger units were known as mahājanapadas. Although the texts have different lists of them, the more frequent list gives the names of 16 mahājanapadas, extending from Gandhāra in the northwest to Anga in the east and to Aśhmaka in central India, close to the Godavari River (see map).

Often, the gateways through the rampart walls would be deliberately kept narrow, so guards may control the movement of people and goods entering or leaving the city. It is fascinating to note that most of those ancient capitals continue to be living cities today — ‘modern’ cities that are often 2,500 years old! Early Democratic Traditions Each janapada had an assembly or council, called sabhā or samiti, where matters concerning the clan would be discussed. (Remember, from the chapter on ‘India’s Cultural Roots’, that the words sabhā and samiti first appear in the Vedas, India’s most ancient texts.)

More Innovations The age of the janapadas and mahājanapadas was an age of profound change, which would impact Indian civilisation until present times. In the chapter ‘India’s Cultural Roots’ in Grade 6, we saw the emergence of several new schools of thought — late Vedic, Buddhist, Jain in particular, and their respective literatures. Those schools disseminated their teachings and literature through scholars, monks and nuns travelling across India or people undertaking pilgrimages. Indian art also underwent a renewal; it will blossom in the age of empires. Urbanisation does not happen without technologies. Let us remember that the Harappan civilisation mastered copper and bronze metallurgy. Now, in this Second Urbanisation, a major shift in technology involved iron metallurgy. In several regions of India, the techniques of extracting and shaping iron were actually perfected from the early 2nd millennium BCE, but it took a few centuries for iron to become a part of daily life. By the late 2nd millennium BCE, iron tools had become widespread, facilitating agriculture on a bigger scale. Iron also made better weapons than bronze, lighter and sharper — swords, spears, arrows, shields, etc. As it happens, there is some evidence of warfare between neighbouring mahājanapadas — how frequent or how intense it was, of course, is impossible to tell. Such military campaigns, but occasionally alliances too, gave rise to new kingdoms and empires, which we will turn to later in our journey. Another innovation was the first use of coins in India, made necessary by growing trade. Very soon, coins were exchanged across different regions and even with other parts of the world.

Think about several possible factors why this happens. Æ List other such professions you expect in a complex society of the 1st millennium BCE. In an ideal society, all those groups would complement each other and work in harmony. But most of the time, these divisions also lead to inequalities: some groups acquire more wealth, power or influence than others. In other words, while equality is an ideal that human societies have often aspired to, very few, if any, have ever achieved it. In India, the society was organised in a two-fold system. One category was the jāti, a group or community of people with a specific professional occupation closely tied to their livelihood. The skills that defined a particular jāti — for instance, skill in agriculture, metallurgy, commerce or any craft — was generally transmitted from generation to generation. Often, a jāti would get further subdivided into sub-jātis, each of which developed customs and traditions of its own, for instance concerning marriage, rituals or food habits. Along with the jāti, there is another category, that of varṇa, a concept that emerged from Vedic texts. There were four varṇas: Brahmins were engaged in preserving and spreading knowledge, and in the performance of rituals; Kshatriyas were expected to defend the society and the land, and to engage in warfare if necessary; Vaishyas were supposed to increase the society’s wealth through occupations of trade, business or agriculture; finally, Shudras were the artisans, craftspeople, workers or servants."}

It comes from a Portuguese word, casta, as Portuguese travellers to India in the 16th century CE tried to make sense of Indian society. While a few scholars consider ‘caste’ to refer to varṇas, most take it to apply to jātis; yet others consider ‘caste’ to refer to the whole varṇa–jāti system. There is historical evidence, both in texts and inscriptions, that in the early period individuals and communities changed their professional occupations if circumstances demanded. For instance, a long drought or some natural calamity could force a community of farmers to migrate to a city and take up other occupations, or some Brahmins would turn to trade or even military activities. This complex system structured Indian society, organised its activities, including economic ones, and therefore gave it some stability. In time, however, the system became rigid and led to inequalities and discrimination towards the lower jātis or some communities excluded from the varṇa-jāti system. This process will be studied in a higher grade. The varṇa-jāti system has had a deep impact on Indian society, and generations of scholars have studied its countless aspects.

His authority extends over many villages, towns and kingdoms. My uncle told me that it takes close to two months on horseback to reach the borders of the territory!” “That sounds bigger than just a kingdom… What do you call it?” “It is called an Empire,” Ira stated with evident pride. What is an Empire? The word ‘empire’ comes from the Latin ‘imperium’, which means ‘supreme power’. Simply put, an empire is a collection of smaller kingdoms or territories over which a powerful ruler or group of rulers exert power, often after waging war against the smaller kingdoms. The smaller territories still had their own rulers, but they were all tributaries to the emperor, who ruled the whole territory from a capital, usually a major centre of economic and administrative power. In ancient Sanskrit texts, words commonly used for ‘emperor’ made this clear; they included samrāj, meaning ‘the lord of all’ or ‘supreme ruler’; adhirāja or ‘overlord’; and rājādhirāja or ‘king of kings’. Tributary: A tributary, in our case, is a ruler or a state that has submitted to an emperor and pays tribute— that is, money, gold (or other precious metals), grain, livestock, elephants or other valuable goods produced in their kingdom and is given to the emperor as a sign of submission, loyalty or respect. A synonym for ‘tributary’ is ‘vassal’, and another way to express this is to say that the tributary or vassal kingdoms accepted the emperor’s overlordship."}

Pen your ideas and share them with your class. Trade , trade routes and guilds Conducting military campaigns, especially in distant lands, is not as simple as it might seem. Maintaining an army is a costly affair: soldiers need to be fed, clothed, equipped with weapons, and paid; elephants and horses need to be cared for; roads or ships have to be built, and so on. All this requires considerable economic power, control over the workforce, and access to resources. We can now understand that economic activity — especially production and trade — is one of the keys to maintaining an empire and ensuring people’s welfare and quality of life, which a good ruler should be concerned with. Therefore, establishing and controlling trade routes all over the empire’s territory and beyond is of great importance. That way, the goods traded will grow in quantity and variety, and more trade means more income for the producers and increased tax collections for the ruler. Returning to the case of ancient India, what would have been the traded goods? There is plenty of evidence on this, at least, both from the literature and archaeological excavations — textiles, spices, agricultural produce, luxury items such as gems and handicraft products, and various animals were among the main items of trade. All this brisk trade was not limited to India; many Indian goods travelled towards distant countries by land or sea. More often than not, traders were not just isolated individuals carrying out their own business. They soon understood the benefits of joining forces and creating guilds (śhrenīs). Guilds were powerful associations of traders, craftsmen, moneylenders or agriculturists. As far as evidence shows, a guild had a head (who was usually elected) and executive"}

Second, as an ancient text put it, “Cultivators, traders, herdsmen, moneylenders, and artisans have authority to lay down rules for their respective classes”; in other words, guilds had the autonomy to create their own internal rules, and the king was not to interfere with them (and why should he, if trade flourished?). Guilds spread over large parts of India and endured for centuries. Even after they ceased to exist formally, their spirit continued to influence India’s trade and business activities, sometimes even to this day. The institution of guilds provides an excellent example of the self-organising abilities of Indian society. The ancient village unit, with its various committees and councils, provides another.

One of them, Magadha (modern-day south Bihar and some adjoining areas), rose in importance and set the stage for the fusion of many kingdoms into India’s first empire.

Greek records mention that in a few battles, “women fought side by side with their men.” Alexander himself was seriously wounded in a battle. Tired and homesick, his soldiers lost the will to fight and refused to move deeper into India, towards the Ganga River. Alexander and part of his army retreated to Persia, but through the coastal route in the south and Iran’s harsh desert regions, resulting in heavy losses to his troops out of thirst, hunger and disease. Back in Persia, Alexander faced rebellions and political turmoil.

Alexander challenged them with tricky questions in the form of riddles, warning that he would put those who gave wrong answers to death. However, the Gymnosophists responded to his questions calmly and intelligently. Alexander was impressed and, in the end, spared them all. Over the centuries, different versions of this story have been told, making it one of the most fascinating encounters in history! According to one account, Alexander asked, “Which is stronger, life or death?” One of the sages replied, “Life, because it endures while death does not.” Alexander then asked, “How can a man be most loved?” “If he is most powerful and yet does not inspire fear,” came the reply, perhaps as a hint to the mighty ruler! Historians view such exchanges as a meeting of two great traditions — Greek and Indian philosophies. The Mighty Mauryas After that brief sojourn to the northwest, let us return to Magadha, where we witnessed the decline of the Nanda empire. Around 321 BCE, just a few years after Alexander left India with his army, a new dynasty and new empire emerged: the Maurya Empire founded by Chandragupta Maurya. It quickly absorbed the Nanda empire’s territories and went on expanding beyond. As per many accounts, Chandragupta managed this feat with the help of an able mentor named Kauṭilya, who used his knowledge of politics, governance and economics to create an empire that remains one of the greatest in Indian history.

(Hint: Think back to what you have learnt at the beginning of this chapter) Kauṭilya’s central philosophy of governance is in tune with Indian values: “In the happiness of his subjects lies the king’s happiness; in their welfare his welfare. He shall not consider as good only that which pleases him but treat as beneficial to him whatever pleases his subjects.” In other words, however powerful a king may be, he must give first place to the people’s interests.

At the beginning of his reign, Aśhoka was quite ambitious. He had inherited a vast empire but further expanded it to cover almost the entirety of the Indian subcontinent, except for the southernmost region, but including present-day Bangladesh and Pakistan and parts of present-day Afghanistan. One encounter, however, is said to have changed the path of his life. According to one of his edicts he once marched on Kalinga (modern-day Odisha), where he waged a ferocious war. Seeing the enormous amount of death and destruction on the battlefield, Aśhoka chose to give up violence and, to the greatest extent possible, adopt the path of peace and non-violence that the Buddha taught. THINK ABOUT IT Aśhoka, in his edicts, tells the story of the Kalinga war. He could have chosen not to mention it and maintain his image as a peaceful, benevolent king for future generations. Why do you think he admitted to this destructive war? Embracing Buddhist teachings, Aśhoka sent emissaries to Sri Lanka, Thailand, Central Asia and beyond to spread the message of the Buddha far and wide. Fig. 5.16.

This could happen if, for example, the emperor needed more resources for long military campaigns or in times of drought; local rulers would be burdened with increasing demands for tribute, leading to resentment. Or if a powerful emperor was followed by one perceived to be weak, local kings or chieftains might simply decide to take a chance and stop paying tribute. Also, the larger an empire, the more difficult it is to hold it together, as Alexander experienced; far-off territories are often the first to split away from the empire. Finally, economic crises caused by natural calamities (such as a long drought or floods) could also shake an empire’s structure. Empires are, therefore, something of a paradox. On the one hand, they can bring about political unity, as the Mauryan empire did to almost the entire Subcontinent, and reduce or eliminate warfare among the smaller kingdoms — indeed, a well-managed empire could lead to greater prosperity than smaller, warring kingdoms.

This led to a breakup of the empire — hardly half a century after Aśhoka, as we mentioned in the last chapter. Many new kingdoms emerged across the subcontinent, which, often, were earlier tributary kingdoms under the overlordship of the Maurya empire. The northwest region became weak, exposing it to invasions from outside the subcontinent.

Once again, this will pave the way for regional powers to assert or reassert their dominance and establish new kingdoms. Coming of the Chedis Let us go back a little. Do you remember the Kalinga war mentioned in the previous chapter? After the decline of the Maurya Empire, Kalinga rose as a prominent power under the kings of the Chedi dynasty. Khāravela, one of their main rulers, was a devoted follower of Jain teachings; he was sometimes called bhikṣhu-rāja or monk-king, although he respected all schools of thoughts. Near Bhubaneswar, the famous Udayagiri-Khandagiri caves, likely developed for Jain monks, feature intricate panels and statues, and spacious rooms carved into the rock, showcasing the skill of the craftsmen. The design and craftsmanship of these caves make them notable examples of ‘rock-cut architecture’, a style of architecture that we will turn to in higher classes. Fig. 6.13.1.

Khāravela also proudly declares that he created a ‘council of ascetics and sages’ from a hundred regions and is ‘accomplished in extraordinary virtues, respector of every sect and repairer of every temple’. Once again, a ruler takes pride in extending his protection to all schools of thought. This is a fundamental part of what we may call the ‘Indian ethos’.

Picture yourself as a sculptor in that era, shaping stone into art with your own hands. What tools would you use? Kingdoms and Life in the South In India’s southern region, this period, between the 2nd or 3rd century BCE and the 3rd century CE, saw the rise to prominence of three powerful kingdoms — the Cheras, the Cholas and the Pānḍyas — which often competed with each other for control over the South, while also contributing to the region’s growth in trade and culture. Let’s remember how Aśhoka’s empire stopped at those south Indian kingdoms (which he mentions in his edicts), which suggests that they remained independent even at the height of Mauryan power. And although Khāravela claims that he defeated an alliance of south Indian kings that threatened his own territory, the location of that battle is unknown and he does not seem to have invaded the southern region.

The Sangam literature, the oldest in south India, consists of several collections or anthologies of poems and is much consulted by historians who investigate the society and culture of the times. Primarily, Sangam poetry expresses with great skill and delicacy personal emotions such as love or societal values like heroism and generosity. The Cholas The Sangams refer to three ‘crowned kings’ — the Cholas, Cheras and Pānḍyas. The Cholas were a powerful dynasty that ruled parts of south India from the 3rd century BCE to the 13th century CE.

The Cheras were known for their extensive trade connections with the Roman Empire and West Asia, exporting many goods from India to the outside world. The kingdom became a hub for the export of spices, timber, ivory and pearls. THINK ABOUT IT Have you ever wondered how historians uncover the trade relations between two distant kingdoms many centuries ago? Let’s take a moment to brainstorm and discuss how this information comes to light. The Chera kings issued a number of coins under their reign. Do you notice the royal emblem of Cheras on one such coin given below? The Pānḍyas The Pānḍyas’ rule over parts of Tamil Nadu and the surrounding regions, with their capital at present-day Madurai, goes back several centuries BCE. Successive kings expanded the Pāndyan kingdom. In his work Indika, Megasthenes mentions this kingdom as a prosperous one, with a strong administration and involved in active trade with distant powers like the Greeks and Romans, apart from much internal trade (Khāravela, for instance, states that he gets hundreds of pearls brought from the Pānḍya kingdom).

Invasions of the Indo-Greeks Having completed our brief journey into south India, it is time to return to the north, where a very different kind of development is about to occur. So far, we have only visited a few native dynasties; yet the same period also witnessed the arrival of invaders who entered through the northwest frontier and took control of the northwestern, northern, and central regions of the Subcontinent. Let us first examine the legacy of Alexander’s brief campaign in the Indus plains. While retreating from the areas he had conquered, he left satraps behind. Over time, these regional rulers established their independent domains and came to be known as ‘Indo-Greeks’. After the decline of the Mauryas, the areas in the northwestern regions (roughly present-day Pakistan and Afghanistan) were an easy target for the Indo-Greeks. However, while they arrived as conquerors, they were much influenced by the rich local culture. This cultural interaction led to a blend of Greek and Indian elements in governance, art, language, and daily life, shaping the cultural landscape of the region. The Heliodorus pillar, near Vidisha (Madhya Pradesh), is a notable example of such connections. It is named after an Indo- Fig. 6.19. The Heliodorus pillar near Vidisha"}

Those coins were made of gold, silver, copper and nickel often portraying a king on one side and Greek deities on the other. However, some coins, instead, depicted Indian deities like Vāsudeva-Kṛiṣhṇa and Lakṣhmī. The rule of the Indo-Greeks ended with the invasions of the Indo-Scythians or Śhakas (see a little below).

The sculptures feature a variety of deities reflecting the peaceful co-existence of various schools of thought. This era saw the rise of representations of deities — like Sūrya or the sun god — which looked more similar to humans and the increase in the development of religious art, laying the groundwork for later temple architecture in the subcontinent. The Gāndhāra style, which emerged in the western regions of Punjab, blended Greco- Roman elements with Indian features.

He set out on this long and difficult pilgrimage to visit sacred Buddhist sites, learn from renowned Indian scholars and collect manuscripts of Buddhist texts so he could take them back to China. Faxian travelled extensively across India, observing her culture, governance and society, and recorded his experiences and observations for the people of his homeland — and for us too — since his travelogue has survived to this day! Below is an excerpt from his travelogue, where he records his observations of the society in the Gupta era. The people are numerous and happy […] they have no need to register households or attend to officials. […] Those who farm royal land pay a portion of their grain. […] The king’s guards and attendants have salaries […] The cities are the greatest in the Middle Kingdom [i.e. the Gangetic plains], and the inhabitants are rich, prosperous, and practice kindness and righteousness. Heads of Vaishya families [i.e. merchants or traders] establish houses for charity and medicines […] the poor, orphans and the sick are cared for […] doctors provide treatment, and the needy receive food and medicines. […] The city has many wealthy Vaishya elders and foreign merchants, with beautiful homes […] The lanes are kept in good order. – A Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms (AD 399–414) (Translated by J.

Let us not, however, forget that elsewhere in his travelogue, Faxian also describes the harsh treatment of the chanḍālas, who were regarded as outcastes and lived outside the city limits. Just as you may have perceived the excerpt from Faxian’s travelogue differently from your friends, a group of historians may examine the same source and draw varied interpretations from it. Historians then look at more sources to corroborate their understanding. This reminds us of the need to assess multiple sources, perspectives and interpretations before drawing conclusions. Glimpses of the Gupta Empire Governance and administration Let us observe the map in Fig. 7.8. You will notice that many kingdoms coexisted during the same period. Some of them may have been at war with each other in their ambition to expand their control. Recall what we saw earlier about Kauṭilya’s ideas on ruling a kingdom. He advised rulers to form alliances (mitra) as one of the components of the saptānga. New kings … new titles Inscriptions and coins provide valuable insights into the titles adopted by Gupta rulers, such as ‘mahārājadhirāja’, ‘samrāṭ’, and ‘chakravartin’. These titles reflected their claim to supreme authority and emphasised their superiority over earlier rulers who used simpler titles like ‘rājan’ and ‘mahārāja’. The Gupta rulers used various strategies, including military conquests, diplomacy, and alliances, to expand and consolidate their vast empire. The last method included matrimonial alliances. A well-known example is that of Prabhāvatī Gupta, Outcastes: Someone who has been rejected from a social or cultural group; in this case, a category of people considered socially too low to be part of the varṇa system."}

Tragically, the Vākāṭaka prince died early, making her the regent ruler of the kingdom. During her reign, she ensured that the ties between the Vākāṭakas and the Guptas remained strong.

Instead of controlling everything from a central authority, they divided the empire into provinces and granted land to local rulers, priests and chieftains. These land grants were carefully inscribed on copper plates to keep accurate records — many of which have been discovered by archaeologists in recent times. This system helped ensure proper tax collection and allowed the Gupta rulers to govern efficiently while still giving local leaders some control over their regions. Thriving trade The primary source of revenue of the Gupta’s was land tax. Other sources included fines, taxes on mines, irrigation, trade and crafts. This revenue was used for administration, maintaining the army, building temples and infrastructure, and supporting scholars and artists. As we see once again, for such an empire to sustain itself, it had to promote a vibrant internal and external trade. In the Gupta era, India traded with the Mediterranean world, Southeast Asia and China, exporting textiles, spices, ivory and gemstones. The Indian Ocean trade network connected Indian ports to distant markets. One significant stop on the way to the Mediterranean markets was Socotra Island, strategically located in the Arabian Sea. Archaeological evidence, such as pottery, inscriptions in the Brahmi script, and designs such as a Buddhist stūpa, has established the presence of Indian traders there over several centuries, apart from traders from Egypt, Arabia, Rome and Greece. This small island carries evidence of the rich cultural exchanges that trade promoted in the Indian Ocean. New Ideas and Wonders: The Classical Age As we saw, Gupta rulers were devout followers of Viṣhṇu; this is often reflected in their coins and inscriptions. However, they also supported other traditions and schools of thought. They patronised Buddhist institutions, including the renowned Nālandā university and several other Buddhist vihāras (monastery). Their approach was inclusive and open. We will explore these institutions further in higher grades."}

Texts like the Charaka Saṃhitā and Suśhruta Saṃhitā, which laid the foundation for Ayurvedic practices still in use today, were compiled and given their final shape during the Gupta period. They deal with a wide range of topics — the cataloguing and diagnosing of diseases, their treatments, the importance of diet in maintaining good health, the preparation of medicines, and surgical techniques advanced for their time. Importantly, Āyurveda emphasises holistic healing and a deep connection between the mind, body, and nature. The Quest for Beauty The Gupta rulers created a supportive environment where creativity and craftsmanship thrived; some of the iconic works of history were produced during this time. Many key centres of art emerged during these times, including Sārnāth (near Varanasi in present-day Uttar Pradesh), known for its exquisite sculptures of the Buddha, and the awe-inspiring Ajanta caves (in present-day Maharashtra). The rock-cut caves and detailed carvings of deities at Udayagiri (Madhya Pradesh) are another example of this abundant artistic production. ‘Gupta art’, as it is sometimes called, set high standards of aesthetics and beauty that left a lasting impact.

The fierce Hūṇa tribe from central Asia repeatedly attacked the empire, weakening its control over north India. At the same time, the rise of powerful regional rulers led to internal conflicts. However, was this truly the end, or the beginning of a period that marked a turning point in Indian history? We will explore this question in the next part of this book. Meanwhile in the South and Northeast ... Let us go back to the map in Fig. 7.8. While the Guptas ruled in the north, the Pallavas emerged as a powerful dynasty in the south, gradually consolidating their power in parts of present- day Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Their origins are not clearly known, but they appear to have been a tributary power under the Sātavāhanas, whom we encountered in the previous chapter, and to have gained power as the Sātavāhanas declined.

Most of them were devotees of Śhiva and are credited with constructing magnificent temples and rock-cut caves, some of which we will visit when we explore classical Indian architecture. The capital of the Pallavas, Kānchipuram (in present-day Tamil Nadu), often known as the ‘city of a thousand temples’, developed as one of the major centres of learning in the south.

In the case of Buddhism, those are often places that were visited by the Buddha or where his relics are kept.

For at least 3,000 years, and with no modern means of transportation available, Indians have been crisscrossing the Subcontinent, resulting in its entire geography being considered sacred. We will return to this soon. Tīrtha: Literally, a place where one can cross a river or other body of water. Symbolically, it becomes a place where one can cross from the ordinary worldly life to a higher, spiritual life. Such places are held in high reverence and regarded as sacred. India has, for ages past, been a country of pilgrimages. All over the country, you find these ancient places, from Badrinath, Kedarnath and Amarnath, high up in the snowy Himalayas down to Kanyakumari in the south. What has drawn our people from the south to the north and from the north to the south in these great pilgrimages? It is the feeling of one country and one culture. — Jawaharlal Nehru, 1961 Here’s an excerpt from the writings of Dharampal, a historian and thinker: “I was travelling from Gwalior to Delhi … when I met a group of people … about twelve of them, some three or four women and seven or eight men ... They said that they had been on a pilgrimage, three months long, up to Rameswaram, among other places. They came from two different villages north of Lucknow. They had various bundles of things and some earthen pots with them ... They had taken all the necessities for their food—atta, ghee, sugar— with them … I asked them, “You are going to Delhi now?” “Yes!”, they replied. “You will stop in Delhi?” “No, we only have to change trains there. We’re going to Haridwar! ... We don’t have time … We have to go to Haridwar. And then we have to get back home.”"}

In Grade 6 we learnt that in such belief systems, people regard elements of Nature, such as mountains, rivers, trees, plants and animals, and sometimes stones too, as sacred. In Hinduism, for instance, this includes countless geographical sites or features of Nature, such as specific mountains, rivers and forests, which are regarded as particularly divine and are worshipped as deities; many rivers are regarded as devīs, while some species of trees, animals and plants are particularly holy. This tradition comes from the perception of a divine presence in all of Nature. Ultimately, the whole of planet Earth is considered sacred — she is Mother Earth or Bhūdevī. Here are a few more examples of such traditions:  The Niyam Dongar hill in the Niyamgiri Range of Jharkhand is sacred to the Dongria Khond tribe. They believe that the hill is the abode of Niyam Raja, the supreme deity who provides everything they need for sustenance. Cutting trees here is prohibited and considered a sign of disrespect to the deity.  In the early 2000s, the Government of Sikkim identified several sacred mountains, caves, lakes, rocks and hot springs that were to be protected against all forms of damage.  In the Nilgiris of Tamil Nadu, the Todas, a tribal community, regard many mountain peaks as sacred and associate them with their gods. To them, this sense of sacredness extends to many plants (which often become part of their rituals), Shola forests, wetlands, and even specific stones and individual trees. Fig. 8.5.

A similar aspiration exists with respect to the 12 jyotirlingas, which are considered highly auspicious. The 51 Shakti pīṭhas, too, cover the entire map of India (even parts of present-day Bangladesh and Pakistan). And there are many more regional networks. These networks crisscross India’s length and breadth, creating a sacred geography. As a result, the land itself becomes sacred. There is a story about the 51 Shakti pīṭhas. Shakti, the divine mother in the form of Satī, and her consort, Śhiva, were insulted by her father. An angry Satī immolated herself. Shiva was so livid that he took her body and refused to allow the last rites. Śhiva’s anger was dangerous for the world and the cosmos. So Viṣhṇu used his chakra to cut up Satī’s body. The Shakti pīṭhas are the places across the Subcontinent where the body parts of the divine mother fell one by one. The symbol behind the story is clear: the whole land becomes the body of the divine mother. LET’S EXPLORE Note the locations of the chār dhām. What do you think it implied for the people when they travelled north-south and east-west? While visiting the major sacred places connected to their respective faiths, pilgrims would naturally cover the geography of India. They would come across diverse languages, customs, clothing and foods along the way, but would notice the commonalities too. The 12 jyotirlingas are sacred shrines dedicated to Śhiva, a major deity of Hinduism. Each shrine has its own unique mythology and name."}

Apart from religious motivations, some, like merchants and traders, travelled to exchange goods; others travelled to discuss, debate and popularise their beliefs or to learn and study from eminent teachers in different parts of the country. However, though they were travelling for different purposes, their routes often converged. Discussions and debates, sharing of goods, experiences, and tales, enriched everyone. New ideas emerged, and old ones were adapted. This complex process became a major factor in the cultural integration of the Indian Subcontinent. Sacred Ecology Tīrthas are usually located on the banks of a river or a lake, in a forest or on a mountain. As we saw above, the natural landscape itself is thus seen or perceived as sacred space, or puṇyakṣhetra. This perception has helped us to protect and preserve Nature, since we are not distinct from her. So geography, culture and spirituality fuse together in these kṣhetras. Rivers and sangams (confluence of rivers) Rivers have been worshipped in India since Vedic times. The nadīstuti sūkta of the Ṛigveda is a hymn (sūkta) in praise of (stuti) rivers (nadī) that invokes 19 major rivers of ancient northwest India. Even today, many rituals involving water invoke the presence of some of the most important rivers of India: gange cha yamune chaiva godāvarī sarasvatī narmade sindhu kāverī jalesmin sannidhiṃ kuru Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari, Sarasvati, Narmada, Sindhu, and Kaveri, may you manifest in this water.

In local languages, these rivers are referred to with respect—for instance, ‘Ganga ji’ or ‘Yamuna ji’."}

Since it stays green almost through the year, it provides food and shelter to many types of birds and other animals. Over time, many rural and tribal communities across India decided to protect and preserve some natural forests from harmful activities such as hunting, tree felling or mining. They saw those forests as the abodes of deities — for example, Ryngkew or Basa in Meghalaya. Such special forests are called ‘sacred groves’ in English (see the table below for a few names in regional languages) and, thanks to their sacred status, have come to shelter great biodiversity of flora and fauna. Many sacred groves are also home to small water bodies and thus help in water conservation. There were many thousands of sacred groves in India. Sadly, these numbers have been shrinking as people have started encroaching on them for various purposes, from agriculture to industry.

Besides, bats play a critical role in the pollination of flowers and in the dispersal of seeds. Sacred groves thus evolve a harmonious relationship between the deity, the ecosystem, and humans. From pilgrimage to trade Pilgrims encounter traders and merchants along their journey. This interaction benefits both groups. Pilgrims need various items, which traders can provide.

As we studied in Grade 6, ‘democracy’ is best understood as ‘rule of the people.’ This means that the source of power and authority in a democracy are the people of the country. Let’s understand this with the example of a school. A school example A school is full of activities and things that must be done. Many day-to-day tasks need to be managed, and things need to be organised. For example, there are timetables to be made and followed, sports activities to be organised, food to be served during lunch time (also called the mid-day-meal), utensils to be cleaned, speakers to be decided for the morning assembly, and activities to be arranged for ‘No Bag Days’. The list is very long in terms of all that needs to be done in the school. With so many things to be done, the Head Teacher realised that a Student Committee should be appointed so that students can be part of making the relevant rules to get all this done, then help in implementation of the rules, and ensure that the rules are being followed. The question before the Head Teacher was — who will be part of the committee? The Head Teacher discussed this in the assembly. She proposed that it would be good if some students can take responsibility for these tasks. A student committee should be formed. Hearing this, the students got excited and started arguing. Naghma: Students in Grade 12 are the most senior; we will take care of everything. Shobha: But you will finish school in a few months. The students in Grade 11 should take care of everything. Gurpreet: If the students of only one grade will take care of everything, then how will they know about the problems that other grades face? Fig. 9.3 THINK ABOUT IT The school example helps us to understand the concept of representation and how it works. However, the students’ committee is different from Parliamentary and Legislative committees, as class representatives in a school are quite different from Members of Parliament (MPs) and Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs). What are these differences? Discuss with your teacher in the classroom and make a list."}

LET’S EXPLORE Which of the three methods do you think is most effective? Why? The first method may seem appealing, but if every student in the school is part of the committee, it will be difficult to reach decisions and manage implementation effectively. In the second method, since the Head Teacher selects the students for the committee, many students will not have a role and won’t have a way to ensure that their voices are heard regarding what they need and want. However, in the third method, students from each grade can choose one representative from among themselves — someone they believe will effectively advocate for their class’s needs. This representative will serve on the committee, meaning that the student committee will consist of representatives from each grade. This approach is a democratic way to choose representatives and form a committee. Functions of Government Previously, we discussed the various roles that a government plays in our lives, similar to the responsibilities of a student committee in a school. Just like the school committee, a government must create necessary rules, implement them, and ensure that everyone follows these rules. These three responsibilities are known as the functions of government. Representative: A person who is chosen to act or make decisions on behalf of another person or group of people"}

Finally, ensuring that the rules are followed is referred to as the judicial function. Democracy is defined as the ‘rule of the people’. This means that, similar to the third method of electing representatives in a school, in a democracy, the people select their representatives to govern them. However, not every country uses the same method for choosing these representatives. We will explore this topic in more detail in the following sections. DO YOU KNOW?

The government of any country evolves over time. Since countries have their own history, culture, and aspirations, it is natural that governments of different countries are different. Let’s look at some aspects that can make one form of government different from another. These differences will become clearer when we look at various types of government later in the chapter. Key differences between governments Who gets to decide that ‘this is the government’? How is the government formed? What are the different parts of the government and what do they do? 1. Who gets to decide that ‘this is the government’? This is the most basic difference across many types of government. Who or what says that ‘this is the government of our country’? That is, who or what gives the government its authority and power? For example, in a democracy like India, it is the people of the country who decide and are the source of authority, while in a theocracy, the source of authority is religious beliefs and the head of a religious institution. 2. How is the government formed? In a democracy, a government is formed usually through some kind of election. While in kingdoms which have kings or queens, the kind that you have read about in other chapters, usually someone from within the family continues to rule and decide how the government will be set up. There are other ways of forming a government, and even in democracies there can be different kinds of elections. 3. What are the different parts of the government and what do they do? Any government has many parts and systems, and these vary across different types of government. For example, the three functions of government referred to earlier — legislative, executive, and judiciary — can be performed by totally independent bodies or by the same body. The system to decide how the government will work can be written down in a book of fundamental rules of the country, called the ‘constitution’, which is what happens in most"}

Governments are designed to work towards certain values and ideals. Some governments, like the government of India, are designed to work towards equality and prosperity for all, while some other governments may be designed only for the prosperity of some families or groups. There are differences between different forms of government based on these four major aspects, but there could be other kind of differences. So, let us now look at some types or forms of government. Democratic Governments around the World Democracy is the most popular form of government in the modern world. In this part of the chapter, we will see that there are different kinds of democratic governments. Before we get into the differences, we should know that there are some fundamental principles of any democracy. Fundamental principles of democracy What is the government working for? What goals is it trying to achieve? Equality in a democracy means that every person has the right to be treated equally. It also means that everyone should have equal access to facilities like education and health, and that everyone is equal before the law. Freedom in democracy means that citizens have the right to make their own choices and express their opinions. Representative participation means that every person has a right to choose and elect their representatives. This is done through the process of elections. Elected representatives become a part of the legislature."}

For example, India provided universal adult franchise (meaning the right to vote in elections to all adults) from the very beginning of the Indian republic in 1950; on the other hand, in Switzerland, women got the right to vote only in 1971. Clearly, the above principles are ideals; not all democracies are able to put them in practice. But equally clearly, it is important for the citizens to keep these ideals in front of them. Different forms of democratic governments Let us now understand the different forms of democratic governments around the world. 1. Direct democracy This is a form of democracy where all the citizens of a country are directly responsible for all the rules, regulations and functions. They participate in all the decisions directly. In contemporary times, some kinds of this form are followed in a few countries, like Switzerland. The limitation of this form of government is that it is very hard to carry out in practice, particularly in larger countries — just as we saw in our school story: if everyone becomes a part of the Universal adult franchise grants every citizen (above a certain age) the right to vote to choose their representative. Fundamental rights of a citizen, such as — right to equality, right to freedom of speech and expression, and right against exploitation — are all provided and protected in a democracy. Independent judiciary ensures that every citizen’s fundamental rights are protected, and that laws are followed by the citizens and also by all the parts of the government."}

Representative democracy This is the form of democratic government in which the people elect their representatives through universal adult franchise, just like in India. In this form of democracy, the people do not directly govern, but the government is always accountable to the people. Elections are an integral part of representative democracy through which people can express changes in their choices as well. To accomplish this, elections happen in regular and fixed intervals of time. In India we have general elections every five years, while in the United States of America they occur every four years. DON’T MISS OUT As we stated in the beginning, democracies have evolved over time, and so have their characteristics. Even today, there are a lot of differences in the functioning of these democracies. It is useful to remember that when these countries adopted democracies, they may not have had all the principles of democracy as we understand them today. For example, effective Universal Adult Suffrage in the UK happened in 1928 and in the USA by 1965.

Parliamentary democracy In this form of government, the members of the executive are also part of the legislature. For example, in India, the prime minister and the council of ministers are also members of the parliament. The council of ministers are accountable to the legislature and continue working as long as they have the confidence of the legislature. In India, the council of ministers can continue working while they have confidence of the Lok Sabha. In this form of government, people elect the legislature but not the executive. Selected members of the legislature become ministers. b. Presidential democracy In this form of government, the executive works independently of the legislature. The president is elected by the people. The president does not need to have the confidence of the legislature for his / her position.

This was the case in at least two of India’s ancient mahājanapadas, as you might recall from the chapter ‘New Beginnings: Cities and States’. In the Vajji (or Vṛiji) mahājanapada, the Lichchhavi clan, in particular, practised collective decision-making, and leaders were chosen based on merit rather than birth. Key positions were filled through elections, and representatives from various clans met regularly to address issues and develop solutions to ensure the people’s welfare. As a result, such states have been called early republics. Indeed, the voice of the common people has been valued and upheld in India through the ages, even when the power was in the hands of a king or queen. A remarkable example from the Chola period is seen in the Uttaramerur inscriptions from the 10th century CE in Tamil Nadu, which provide us with details about the election of members to the village sabhā (local administrative body). We learn about the election process, including sealed ballot boxes, qualifications of members, their duties, and also the conditions that could lead to their dismissal. Fig. 9.6.

There were republics in other parts of the world too. In the 5th and 4th centuries BCE, Rome and Greece had republics. In some regions of Greece, free men could vote, but women, workers and slaves could not. Other areas had a system where only a small, privileged group could vote or make decisions. Other Forms of Government In the previous sections we saw that democracy is the most popular form of government in today’s world, and that there are different forms of democracy as well. Let us now look at other forms of governments, and understand their basic structures. 1. Monarchy As we saw in chapters of ‘Tapestry of the Past’, mahājanapadas were headed by kings, who were guided by the sabhā or samiti and were expected to take decisions and advice of these institutions seriously. As empires were built and expanded across India, kings began to gain immense power. Yet, they relied on a council of ministers and a network of officials to help them govern the empire. In many cases, the king also sought the advice of learnt scholars on matters related to dharma. Of course, there were also examples of kings who used their power to subjugate their people. In some parts of the world, kings had all the power; they made the laws, enforced them, and also decided the punishments. In some cases, they claimed to have received divine power from God. However, in many parts of India, the power of the raja was neither absolute nor beyond question. The king was Subjugate: To take control of people or a place by using force and make the people obey. Slave: A person who is forced to work for and obey another and is considered to be their property. Fig. 9.7. Adoration of the pillar of Sanchi Stūpa"}

A raja is not just a ruler; the welfare of his people is his highest priority. He must apply the law without bias to ensure fairness and equality. He must not get attached to power, as it fosters ego and corruption. He must seek guidance from wise advisors to ensure just and well-informed decisions. The raja must understand that his authority is temporary and bound by dharma. Fig. 9.8.

When the builders complained to the king that he did not even allow them to take measurements, the king blamed them for not asking the cobbler’s permission first. The king received the cobbler, who explained that his humble hut was like a mother to him and as precious to him as the palace was to the king: “The misery people feel when their homes are forcibly taken away can be described only by a god who has fallen from his celestial car or by a king who has lost his kingdom!” Nevertheless, the cobbler expressed his readiness to let go of his hut if only the king would come and respectfully ask for his permission — which the king did, giving him adequate money as compensation. “For those who desire happiness, there should be no false pride,” concludes the text, while the cobbler praised the king’s commitment to dharma, even towards a lowly subject! – From Rājataraṅgiṇī by the Kashmiri scholar Kalhaṇa (12th century CE) 2. Monarchies today A monarchy is the type of government that is ruled by a monarch. Kings and queens are called monarchs, who exercise their sovereign power. Monarchies are usually hereditary; typically, the eldest son of the ruling monarch becomes the next king. Today we have two types of monarchy: a. Absolute monarchy In an absolute monarchy the monarch has complete control in the making of laws, Sovereign: Sovereign indicates that the source of power of a country is independent from external influence. Monarchs: Kings or queens who inherit their position from their family, usually passing it from one generation to the next within the royal family."}

Saudi Arabia is an example of an absolute monarchy; here the king holds all power and governs according to Islamic law. However, he appoints a council that advises and assists him on governance; but he is not bound by the council’s advice. b. Constitutional monarchy Let us consider an example of a different kind of monarchy. The United Kingdom or Britain is also a monarchy. The head of the state is the king or queen, but he or she has only nominal power and the real power of the executive is exercised by the prime minister. The legislative power is exercised by the parliament. This means that all the laws are made by the elected parliament, and executive power is exercised by the Council of Ministers led by the prime minister. So while Britain has a king, it really is, today, a parliamentary democracy. This kind of monarchy is called a constitutional monarchy."}

Theocracy A theocracy is a form of government where the country is ruled by the rules of religion and religious leaders. Iran, whose full official name is ‘Islamic Republic of Iran’ has a unique political system combining elements of both a theocratic and democratic governance. Their constitution is based on the fundamental principles of Islam, the country’s official religion. The Supreme Leader, who has the ultimate authority over the legislature, executive and judiciary, is selected by a group of Islamic clerics and his term is for life. There are also an elected president and a parliament that take care of everyday governance. The intent of the republic is to establish a society based on Islamic norms. Other theocracies currently in existence include Afghanistan and Vatican City. 3. Dictatorship A dictatorship is a form of government in which one person, or a small group possesses absolute power — they do not have any limits imposed on them by a constitution or law. The 20th century witnessed many examples of dictators who created extremely difficult circumstances for the people; we will only see two of them here.  Soon after Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany in 1933, he passed laws that gave him full power and eliminated the opposition. He was now a dictator. Convinced of the superiority of his people, he believed that Germany should rule the world and dominate ‘inferior races’. He was responsible for the killing of at least six million Jews (this is known as the ‘Holocaust’) as well as hundreds of thousands of Roma and other groups of people.

It is a type of government where a small, powerful group makes all the important deci- sions; usually they are wealthy families or influential people. In some places in ancient Greece, aristocratic families ruled as oligarchies. In modern times, political commentators have observed that even some democracies show signs of oligarchy when a small group of politicians and wealthy businesspeople hold too much influence in governance.

You have read about different forms of government above and how the form of government defines the lives of its citizens. In the previous table, we could see that the representation of people’s choices and rights varies across the different forms. In a genuine democracy, the people can lead their everyday lives in the way they want. They can choose what to speak, what to wear, what beliefs to follow, and how to express themselves. All of this can be done in a democracy until and unless it harms someone else’s rights. In a democratic government, the people choose their government. The government is accountable for protecting the rights of its people and is responsible for providing basic needs to its citizens. If the government does not perform its functions properly, the people can change their representatives through elections. This ensures that there is a constant check of what the government does. Thus, the values and ideals of the government in a democracy should focus on the well-being of all its people. Our country is a democracy, and you can see many of the features of a democracy in our lives every day. It is therefore no wonder that more than half of the countries in the world have adopted democracy and democratic forms of government.

A simple answer is that it is a document that spells out a nation’s basic principles and laws. It lays out:  the framework of the three organs of the government (legislature, executive, and judiciary) and their roles and responsibilities;  checks and balances amongst the three organs of government to ensure fairness, responsibility and accountability;  the rights and duties of the citizens;  an outline of the long-term goals and aspirations of the nation.

For example, the ideals of ‘liberty, equality, fraternity’ were adopted from France’s constitution (which enshrined them from the French Revolution of 1789); the idea of the Directive Principles of State Policy (which we will study shortly) was inspired by the Irish Constitution; and the American Constitution helped shape the concept of an independent judiciary.

LET’S REMEMBER Æ There are three organs of government — legislature, executive and judiciary — and the ‘separation of powers’ is essential to their effective working. Æ The legislature makes the laws. Æ The law is implemented by the executive, which is headed by the prime minister. Æ The judiciary ensures that all laws made are in accordance with the Constitution. It also decides whether a law has been broken and what punishment is necessary. Æ We have a three-tier system of government — central, state and local (Panchayati raj system). Æ Some functions and responsibilities are reserved for the central government, and others are assigned to the state government. The Constitution addresses these points comprehensively. It clearly defines the roles, functions, responsibilities, and accountability measures for each organ of government. The electoral system has been laid down to ensure that every eligible citizen of the country is enabled to vote. Other core aspects of the Constitution are the Fundamental Duties, Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles of State Policy. The infographic (Fig. 10.14) provides us with examples of a few of the Fundamental Duties and Rights (which are listed in full in the beginning of all NCERT textbooks). The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP, as they are popularly called) represent the essence of the social and economic vision that the framers of the Constitution had for India. The examples we present in the infographic illustrate the principles they wanted governance to follow."}

They reflect the direction they wished the country take to make India better for all; for example, everybody in the country must have a good standard of living. But if the government does not make efforts to follow this, one cannot go to a judge and complain about it. The DPSP are more like guidelines than strict rules. Fundamental Rights, on the other hand are promises that must be kept. If someone treats you unfairly because of who you are, you can actually go to court and the judge can help you. The people who wrote our Constitution created this system on purpose. They wanted some rights that could be demanded immediately (Fundamental Rights) and some bigger goals (Directive Principles) that might take time to achieve as our country progressed.

Why do you think she said that the equality of women was not a new concept for India? Discuss in the class. Sir, the women of India are happy to step into their rightful heritage of complete equality with men in all spheres of life and activity. I say so because I am convinced that this is no new concept which has been postulated for the purposes of this Constitution, but is an ideal that has long been cherished by India, though social conditions for some time had tragically debased it in practice. This Constitution affirms that ideal and gives the solemn assurance that the rights of women in law will be wholly honoured in the Indian Republic. — Begum Aizaz Rasul, 22 November 1949, during the Constituent Assembly’s debates"}

Today, we use coins and notes to buy and sell things. People also use their mobile phones and computers for such transactions. The barter system was the earliest form of exchange. There is a lot of evidence of it from around the world. People used commodities such as cowrie shells, salt, tea, tobacco, cloth, cattle (cows, goats, horses, sheep), seeds, etc. Transaction: a piece of business that is done between people, especially an act of buying or selling.

They would have to find someone who wants the exact item that they want to give, and in return are also able to offer exactly what the other party wants. This scenario is called double coincidence of wants. Even if there are two people who want each other’s goods and are also willing to make an exchange, other issues could arise — in what proportion should the two goods be exchanged? In such cases, it becomes difficult to compare the value of one good against another. If one of the people feels that the exchange is disadvantageous, they would not be interested in the exchange. This is because there is no common standard measure of value. THINK ABOUT IT What are the instances of double coincidence of wants in the above example?

Interestingly, the mela begins with the Agni Puja or worship of fire, a prayer for universal wellbeing. Beginning in the 15th century, the chiefs of the Tiwa, Karbi, Khasi, and Jaintia tribal communities of Assam and Meghalaya would gather every year to discuss political issues and to maintain friendly relationships. Members of these communities began to gather around this event and soon it turned into a fair, where people would bring their produce and began exchanging them among each other.

These are often exchanged with people from the plains for rice cakes, and other types of food that cannot be grown in the hills.  Book exchange: Think of a fun club where you can trade your old books with friends!

What are the types of experiences people have in this process? Basic Functions of Money It is said that “necessity is the mother of invention.” As the types and numbers of things that were being exchanged grew, and the distances across which barter was beginning to take place became longer, it became clear that there was a need for a different system. A common medium of exchange would make trade easier and so, money came into existence. As more and more people began to use it for transactions — buying and selling goods and services — it became the accepted method of payment.

Will you request the shopkeeper to allow you to make the rest of the payment later? The fact that money is accepted as a way of making deferred payments makes money a standard of deferred payment. If the farmer uses money instead of wheat as a medium of exchange, he can keep the money for a longer time and use it for making purchases later. So, money acts as a store of value that can be used later. Isn’t it fascinating! Money also serves as a common denomination that measures the value of goods and services, and enables the comparison of goods and services in terms of their prices. For example, your parents pay money to the shopkeepers in exchange for various products. This money is used by the shopkeepers to pay salaries to their workers.

New Forms of Money As time has progressed and technology has advanced, other forms of money have come to be used today. Let’s look at some of them. Krishnappa sells seasonal fruit on a cart. Alongside the colourful fruit that he arranges neatly on his cart is a little card with a QR code. His customers scan the QR code with their mobile phones and pay for their purchase digitally. The payment then goes directly into Krishnappa’s bank account. Apart from tangible forms of money such as coins and paper notes, money has taken intangible forms that we cannot touch and feel. This is called digital money which is in electronic form. Have you observed other people around you making or receiving payments without using coins and notes? Different payment methods like debit cards, credit cards, net banking, UPI (Unified Payments Interface), etc., are also used for transactions. These mediums directly transfer money from one person’s bank account into another. You will learn more about the modern methods of monetary transactions later.

A place where people buy and sell goods is called a market. It is also known as bazaar, haat (in Hindi), and mārukatté (in Kannada). What is it called in your region? This can be at a physical place or, as is becoming popular today, online. Goods and services become available to individuals, households, and businesses through markets. For a long time, people have relied on markets to fulfil their needs and wants for goods and services. In addition, markets connect people, traditions, and ideas. Let’s see an example of a market from 16th century India. The Glorious Hampi Bazaar, Karnataka The Hampi Bazaar in Karnataka was one of the prosperous markets in the Vijayanagara Empire which was the centre of flourishing trade. The bazaar was located opposite the Virupaksha temple. The sheer abundance and prosperity of the city have been described in many foreign accounts. The famous Portuguese traveller, Domingos Paes, called Hampi “the best-provided city in the world” due to the wide variety of products traded in the market— grains, seeds, milk, oil, silk, animals like cows, rabbits, horses, and even birds like quails and partridges. Another Portuguese traveller, Fernao Nuniz, wrote about the bazaar, “There were craftsmen, also, working in their streets, so that you Fig. 12.3.

Prices and Markets What happens when there are many buyers and sellers in the market? How do prices respond to how buyers and sellers interact in the market? In the figure given below, the seller wants to sell the guavas at ₹80 per kg. However, buyers may not be willing to buy at that price. If a buyer finds the price very high, he will ask for a price that he is willing to pay. The seller may not be willing to sell at the price offered by the buyer because it would not be profitable for him. The buyer and seller negotiate until a mutually agreeable price is reached. The transaction can then be completed. If such a point is not reached, i.e. the point where the buyer and the seller agree on a price, the transaction may not take place. Let’s see some scenarios below to understand this. 1. What happens in case the seller fixes the price very high? D80/- Fig. 12.5"}

Markets Around Us Markets are present everywhere and in various forms. Physical and online markets A physical market is where buyers can meet the seller physically, and purchase goods or services in exchange for money. This is the most common type of market. It includes weekly markets and haats where vendors sell vegetables, other essential items, and handicraft items lined up on a cart. Local markets with shops and buzzing with vendors selling street food, knick-knacks, and so on are also physical markets. There are also multi-storey buildings, i.e., malls in cities and towns spanning large areas with stores inside. Today buyers and sellers need not necessarily meet in person to engage in a transaction. They can transact from a convenient location even thousands of kilometres away from each other. They can use shopping applications (apps) or websites on a phone or a computer. These apps or websites are created by businesses that make available a wide variety of goods and services. We will read about how this works in a section below. One can buy goods ranging from books, clothes, furniture, and grocery items to electronic items like TVs, mobile phones, and laptops, and get them delivered to their doorstep.

Although buying and selling is an economic activity that involves monetary exchange, interactions in the markets often move beyond just enquiring about the product or service or negotiations between parties. Often, a relationship develops between buyers and sellers that continues even across generations. Some families have long-lasting trusted relationships with their tailor, jeweller, and doctor over decades. Many families in India maintain an account with the local grocer that is settled at the end of the month. So, while the primary role of the market is to promote economic activities, it also has non-economic significance in many people’s lives.

LET’S EXPLORE Have you observed any such practices in your community or neighbourhood? Describe the practice as a drawing or in a short paragraph. Government’s Role in the Market Markets function through interactions of demand from buyers and supply by sellers. However, there are some situations in which this may not work very well. The government plays a crucial role in such situations. It monitors the interaction between consumers and producers, and fair determination of price. Controlling prices for protecting buyers and sellers The government controls the prices of certain goods. For example, it sets the maximum price that the seller can charge. Several essential goods and services, such as lifesaving drugs, have an upper limit on their prices. Another instance is where the government sets the minimum price at which essential agricultural products like wheat, paddy and maize can be sold. This ensures that farmers do not incur losses. The government also sets minimum wages for work done by employees so that employers make fair payments to them.

What do you think happens to the price of onions when this happens? Æ What will happen if the people supplying onions do not bring the required quantities to the market? What do you think the government should do in this situation? Ensuring quality and safety standards The government has a role in ensuring the welfare of consumers and protecting them from unfair practices. The government ensures that manufacturers follow the required quality and safety standards while producing goods and delivering services. For instance, pharmaceutical companies manufacture medicines for treating diseases. The government sets procedures for approvals of medicines and conducts sample testing to check if the produced drug meets standards of quality. These regulations ensure the quality and safety of the drugs so that there is no risk to the consumers’ health. Mitigating the external effects of markets Markets sometimes have significant effects beyond the selling and buying. For example, the markets for certain goods require production in factories that could pollute the environment. The government plays a crucial role in understanding and controlling such effects of markets. For example, what happens when the manufacturing of certain items, like single-use plastics, pollutes the environment and poses health risks to consumers? In such cases, the government intervenes by implementing strict regulations to mitigate these negative effects."}

Governments make rules to ensure markets work fairly and consumers are not exploited. However, too many rules can make it difficult for markets to function properly. Providing public goods Producers make and sell goods and services to be able to make a profit. However, there are some goods and services that producers do not expect to make a profit on; for example, public parks, roads, policing, and so on. In addition, you read about the rights that citizens have to certain welfare provisions in a previous chapter. So, the government provides these public goods and services.

What are the main features of a market? Recall a recent visit to a market to purchase a product. What are the different features of a market that you observed during this visit? 2. Remember the epigraph from a famous economist at the beginning of the chapter? Discuss its relevance in the context of the chapter you have read. 3. In the example of buying and selling of guavas, imagine that the seller is getting a good price, and is able to make a profit. He will try to get more guavas from farmers to be able to sell them at the same price and increase his earnings. What is the farmer likely to do in this kind of a situation? Do you think he will start thinking about the demand for guavas in the next season? What is likely to be his response? 4. Match the following types of markets with their characteristics: S.No. Markets Criteria 1 Physical market Goods and services flow outside the nation’s boundaries 2 Online market Deals in bulk quantities 3 Domestic market Serves the final consumers with goods and services 4 International market Requires physical presence of buyers and seller 5 Wholesale market Buyers and sellers meet virtually and can transact at any time 6 Retail market Lies within the boundaries of a nation 5. Prices are generally determined by the interaction between demand from buyers and supply by sellers. Can you think of products where prices are high despite lesser number of buyers demanding the product? What could be the reasons for that?"}

Look at the real life situation that a retail seller of vegetables encountered: A family came to shop for vegetables. The price of beans that the seller on the cart was offering was ₹30 / kg. The lady started to bargain with the seller to bring the price down to ₹25 / kg. The seller protested and refused to sell at that price saying he would make a loss at that price. The lady walks away. The family then goes to a super bazaar nearby. They buy vegetables in the super bazaar where they pay ₹40 / kg for the beans that is neatly packed in a plastic bag. What are the reasons that the family does this? Are there factors that affect buying and selling which are not directly connected to price? 7. There are some districts in India that are famous for growing tomatoes. However, during some seasons, the situation is not good for farmers. With a large quantity of harvest, there are reports of farmers throwing away their produce and all their hard work going to waste. Why do you think farmers do this? What role can wholesalers play in such situations? What are the possible ways of ensuring that the tomatoes are not wasted, and the farmers are also not at a loss? 8. Have you heard about or visited a school carnival / fair organized by your school or any other school? Discuss with your friends and teachers about the kind of activities organized by students there. How do they conduct selling and negotiation with the buyers? 9. Choose any 5 products and check out the label with the certification signs discussed in the chapter. Did you find products that did not have a logo? Why do you think this is so? 10. You and your classmates have manufactured a soap bar. Design a label for its packaging. What in your opinion should be mentioned on the label for the consumer to know the product better?"}
