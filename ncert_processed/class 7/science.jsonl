{"class": "class 7", "subject": "science", "page_no": 3, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "Foreword The National Education Policy 2020 envisages a system of education in the country that is rooted in an Indian ethos and its civilisational accomplishments in all fields of knowledge and human endeavour. At the same time, it aims to prepare students to engage constructively with the opportunities and challenges of the twenty-first century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. By nurturing students’ inherent abilities across all five planes of human existence (pañchakośhas), the Foundational and Preparatory Stages set the Stage for further learning at Middle Stage. Spanning Grades 6 to 8, the Middle Stage serves as a critical three-year bridge between the Preparatory and Secondary Stages. The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages—including at least two languages native to India—to Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas, as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy—a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. Curiosity, Textbook of Science for Grade 7 aligns with NEP 2020 and NCF-SE 2023, fostering experiential learning through real-world examples. It encourages curiosity, exploration, questioning, and critical thinking."}
{"class": "class 7", "subject": "science", "page_no": 4, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "iv iv The content attempts to integrate science subjects such as physics, chemistry, biology, and earth science with cross-cutting themes like environmental education, value education, inclusive education, and Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS). By incorporating hands-on activities, the textbook engages students in an integrated approach, promoting reflection and group discussions. The textbook emphasises creativity and innovation, positioning students as active learners. Additionally, the adopted pedagogy encourages critical thinking, reasoning, and decision-making. The textbook provides ample opportunities for peer learning, which enhances the overall learning experience for both teachers and students. The focus is on collaboration and active engagement through student-centred approach to education. However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years. \b Dinesh Prasad Saklani Director New Delhi \b National Council of Educational March 2025 \b Research and Training"}

You might still have more questions in science that you wish to explore! The Grade 7 textbook, the second in the Curiosity series picks up where we left off in Grade 6, continuing this exciting journey and helping you explore even more questions that you may wonder about. The Grade 7 textbook has been carefully crafted in alignment with the recommendations of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023. The textbook has been designed to meet curricular goals, covering key scientific concepts like matter, the physical and living world, health, hygiene, and the connection between science, technology and society. Like the Grade 6 textbook, this textbook also focuses on the nature of science and its processes. Each chapter includes creative activities, thought-provoking questions, and helpful illustrations. The textbook combines concepts from biology, chemistry, physics, and earth science, while weaving in cross-cutting themes like value education, inclusive education, environmental education, and the Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS). The goal is to encourage hands- on learning rather than rote memorisation. Through this approach, the Curiosity series aims to help learners think critically and become responsible members of society. Curiosity, Textbook of Science for Grade 7, has twelve chapters. Chapter 1, titled ‘The Ever-Evolving World of Science’, gives an overview of the ideas covered in the book and aims to get the readers excited about learning more about science. It develops a thread connecting all other chapters, showing how they are all linked together. It also highlights that science is primarily a way of thinking, observing, asking questions, and discovering by doing. It is a process rather than a compilation of facts. This fun introductory chapter is meant to excite the students and is non-evaluative. The chapters start with real-life situations to grab the students’ attention and to help them relate with their previous knowledge. The activities in the book are designed to give learners hands-on and minds-on experiences. These activities are inclusive and encourage working together to promote collaborative learning. After each activity, there are questions to help learners check their understanding and see how much they have learnt. We hope the questions make the students think deeply, reflect, and analyse ideas critically to arrive at a conclusion."}

Fascinating Facts The ‘Dive Deeper’ boxes contain advanced concepts that lead to questions for in-depth exploration of a topic. Dive eeper The ‘Holistic Lens’ offers horizontal connections to a concept from multiple perspectives. Holistic Lens ‘Science and Society’ links with real-life applications showing how science has contributed to societal development. Science and Society Some chapters also feature sections called ‘Know a Scientist,’ where students can learn about the contributions of Indian and international scientists related to the relevant topics. Know a Scientist This section includes brief biographies and shows how scientists have made a difference. Each chapter includes highlighted words that emphasise key concepts explained in the chapter. Some highlighted words outline the procedures in scientific activities. An interesting non-evaluative element that has been incorporated in some of the chapters is the introduction of certain verses from various Indian texts to promote rootedness in the learners as envisaged in NEP 2020. The box ‘Fascinating Facts’, highlights fun facts, interesting observations, and curiosity-driven questions."}

In a Nutshell Let Us Enhance Our Learning ‘Let Us Enhance Our Learning’ includes a range of exercises, from pictorial questions and puzzles to multiple-choice questions, offering a challenging and engaging experience. These questions not only help in self-evaluation but also evaluate the competencies developed in each chapter. We recommend that questions for evaluation be similar to the ones in this section. Exploratory Projects A unique feature of the book is ‘Exploratory Projects’, which involves activities designed to encourage the interaction of learners with their peers, parents, teachers, experts, and the community. Learners are encouraged to gather diverse information and draw their own conclusions. Some projects may require prior preparation and collaboration. The textbook is just one way to learn. Learners should also explore and observe their surroundings. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can further enhance learning when used appropriately. The QR codes across the textbook provide access to interactive resources like audio and video clips, puzzles, games, quizzes, and additional content, allowing learners to explore at their own pace and convenience. The journey of each learner through this science textbook is expected to be filled with joy. We hope that the curiosity sparked by this book will continue in the higher grades!

This again, is not just a textbook with facts — it is an invitation to question, to perform experiments, and to explore, as we try to understand the beautiful world we live in. The world of science covers everything — small and large, near and far. We may be looking at tiny cells inside a leaf, or the movement of the sun and the stars. We may be testing out the materials around us at home, or discussing how water ﬂ ows underground. As you go through the chapters in this book, you will start new adventures that challenge your thinking, expand your knowledge, and help you become an explorer, making small discoveries for yourself. Before we dive into our exciting journey, take a moment to observe something special about this book. Look at the page numbers — they follow the playful ﬂ ight of a butterﬂ y and the soaring of a paper plane! Just as a butterﬂ y ﬂ utters freely and a paper plane ﬂ ies into the sky, learning takes ﬂ ight when curiosity leads the way. Did you know that something as simple as a paper plane inspired real scientiﬁ c explorations of ﬂ ight? From early inventors studying bird wings to modern engineers designing aircraft, the dream of ﬂ ying started with simple observations and experiments. So, as you turn each page, let your imagination take ﬂ ight — exploring new ideas, discovering wonders, and reaching for the skies!"}

Science, as we said in Grade 6, is a process, so it is about a way of thinking that welcomes curiosity, asks questions, and is open to the unknown. In Grade 7, we will try to ask deeper questions: How do things work? Why do events happen the way they do? And what can we learn from the patterns that we see in nature? To do this, we have to step out of this book, step out of the classroom perhaps, and experience the world through activities and experiments. These are experiences that we hope will not just be interesting or exciting but also serve as stepping stones to a deeper understanding of the environment we live in and of our place on this planet. We believe that this will also help you to see science as an ongoing process of discovery. And not just about discovery alone, but also about responsibility. As young science explorers, you will soon see how human activities are linked to what happens in the natural world and are connected to the society we live in. You will, we hope, also see the role that science can play in addressing environmental challenges and help in creating a more sustainable world. But let’s get back into this book for now. You will read about topics in diﬀ erent ﬁ elds of science, from physics and chemistry to biology and earth sciences. While they might appear as diﬀ erent chapters, just as we had said in Grade 6, they are all interconnected. Scientiﬁ c ideas in one area often inspire discoveries in another, or at least allow us to ask questions in another area. So, let’s take a quick journey through our book for this year. We will start by looking at the properties of materials around us, mostly the things we experience but perhaps never ask questions about — why are some fruits sour? What happens when we wash a haldi stain on our school uniform?"}

We know from our experience that a torch battery runs out eventually, and can’t be used again. We’ll explore what kind of changes happen around us. Some changes can be reversed and others cannot be reversed. Batteries run out, ice melts into water, fruits ripen, rocks break into pebbles… what kind of changes are these? Some of these happen, or happen faster, when things are heated. We will look at how heat ﬂ ows — whether it is the melting of an ice cube in a glass, or the melting of a glacier. Water is, of course, everywhere, and with the heat from the Sun, it evaporates from the seas and falls as rain, perhaps trickling down into the ground, somewhere far away."}

Not just us humans, there are life processes that are essential to all animals for their survival. To grow, we have to eat and breathe, blood has to circulate the nutrients from the food all over the body and so on. But why animals alone? Don’t plants also need food to grow? How do they get their food? Do they also breathe? How? Over the time that life has evolved on our planet Earth, it has ﬁ gured out how to do this in a beautiful and carefully balanced way. Ah, but what is time? The clock on the wall or a wrist watch tells us the time and how it passes. We get prepared to go to school in the morning and are ready to sleep at night but have you thought about how we measure time? And how fast does something happen? Long before the age of electric clocks and digital watches, early humans observed the shadows of objects in the Sun and used the position of the shadows to tell the time. Light and shadows are not just useful for shadow puppets or to tell the time. Naturally, light helps us see and today, we’ve developed a lot of ways to generate light (so we can read a book at night, even when the Sun doesn’t shine).

Litmus is a natural substance obtained from lichens. It is available both as a solution and in the form of paper strips, known as litmus paper. The litmus paper is available in two colours—blue and red, as shown in Fig. 2.3. Substances that turn blue litmus paper to red are acidic in nature, while those that turn red litmus paper to blue are basic in nature. Since litmus shows diﬀ erent colours in acidic and basic solutions, it is called an acid-base indicator. Some other substances, both natural and synthetic, can also be used as indicators. Synthetic indicators are made in laboratories, and you will learn more about them in higher grades. HOLISTIC LENS Lichens are formed by the association of two living organisms, a fungus and an alga. They grow on rocks and trees in regions that have abundant rainfall and clean air. Do you ﬁ nd lichens on trees in your neighbourhood? Lichens Now, let us classify the substances sorted in Group A, Group B, and Group C in Table 2.2. The substances in Group A, such as lemon juice, amla juice, tamarind water, and vinegar turned the blue litmus paper to red, implying that these substances are acidic in nature. The substances in Group B, such as soap solution, baking soda solution, lime water, and washing powder solution turned the red litmus paper to blue. Hence, these substances are basic in nature. The substances in Group C, such as tap water, sugar solution, and salt solution, did not change the colour of either litmus paper.

{"class": "class 7", "subject": "science", "page_no": 38, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 18 Initially, when a drop of blue litmus solution is added to the lemon juice solution, the colour of the solution turns red. When lime water is added to this test tube, the colour of the solution eventually changes from red to blue. This shows that the solution in the test tube is no longer acidic. Lime water has neutralised the eﬀ ect of the acid. When the solution of an acid is mixed with the solution of a base in suﬃ cient quantity, we ﬁ nd that the resulting solution is neither acidic nor basic. Such reactions are called neutralisation reactions. In a neutralisation reaction, salt and water are formed with the evolution (i.e., release) of heat. Acid + Base →Salt + Water + Heat There are many examples in everyday life where you can observe the use of neutralisation processes. Let us ﬁ nd out! 2.3 Neutralisation in Daily Life y Situation 1: Keerthi was observing a butterﬂ y in the garden with her hand resting on a tree trunk. Suddenly, a red ant bit her, leaving her skin red with stinging pain (Fig. 2.11). Her brother helped her by applying moist baking soda to the aﬀ ected area, which relieved the pain. What do you think might be the reason for this? When an ant bites, it injects an acidic liquid (formic acid) into the skin. The eﬀ ect of the acid can be neutralised by rubbing moist baking soda, which is a base. What remedies do people use to treat ant bites in your region? Situation 2: On the Farmer’s Portal (an online platform from the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare), a query from a farmer states, “My plants are not growing well lately”. After a detailed discussion, it was found that the excessive use of chemical fertilisers (substances added to soil to help plants grow better) made the soil acidic. What remedy might be provided to him? When the soil is too acidic, the plants do not grow well. It can be treated with lime, which is a base. (Fig. 2.12).

Organic matter releases acids that neutralise the basic nature of the soil. Sometimes, the soil may be neutral, but the plants growing in it may still show poor health, which can be due to the deﬁ ciency of nutrients in the soil. Situation 3: Ashwin’s friend Gurbir stays near an industrial area. He shared with him that the ﬁ sh population in his neighbourhood lake was declining day by day! What do you think might be the causes for this? It may be due to factory waste being released into the lake. If the factory waste is acidic in nature, what could be done to save the ﬁ sh in the lake? The factory waste can be neutralised by adding basic substances before releasing into the lake. Let us wrap up! Now, can you explain why the words ‘Welcome to the Wonderful World of Science’ appeared on Ashwin and Keerthi’s paper sheets when the liquid was sprayed on them? Do you think that one possibility could be using a turmeric solution for the spraying liquid and a soap solution for writing on the paper? In a Nutshell Substances around us may be classiﬁ ed as acidic, basic, and neutral in nature. Extracts of lichen, red rose, red hibiscus, purple cabbage, turmeric, etc., can be used to indicate the nature of substances. Substances that show diﬀ erent colours in acidic and basic solutions are called acid-base indicators. Acids turn the colour of blue litmus to red. Bases turn the colour of red litmus to blue. Extract of red rose gives red colour in acidic solutions and green colour in basic solutions. The yellow colour of turmeric turns red in basic solutions but remains unchanged in acidic and neutral solutions. An acid and a base neutralise each other, forming salt and water, along with the evolution of heat. Many day-to-day problems like a red ant bite, acidic or basic nature of soil, and industrial waste can be attempted to be managed by the process of neutralisation."}

You have learnt earlier that electricity is generated in multiple ways — by windmills, by using wind energy, by solar panels capturing the Sun’s energy, by falling water and by using natural gas or coal (in the chapter ‘Nature’s Treasures’ in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity). The electric supply from these sources reaches our homes and factories via wires. For example, at home we plug in various devices to the electrical sockets in the wall. However, to learn about electricity, we will focus on a portable source of electricity that most of us may have used. Let us start with its use in a common device like a torchlight. Caution — The danger signs on electric poles and other appliances warn people that electricity can be dangerous if not carefully handled. Never ever perform experiments with power supply at your home or school. Even electricity from portable generators can be dangerous. Use only batteries or cells, like those in torchlights, wall clocks, radios, or remotes, for experiments with electricity. 3.1 A Torchlight g You might have used a torchlight, also called a torch or a ﬂ ashlight. Activity 3.1: Let us explore Take a torchlight similar to the one shown in Fig. 3.1. Observe it carefully. Do you notice a lamp? And a switch? Slide its switch and observe. Does the torch lamp glow? Now slide the switch back to its original position and observe the torch lamp. You might have noticed that in the ﬁ rst position of the switch, the torch lamp glows and in the other position the lamp does not glow. Now, open the torchlight. What do you ﬁ nd inside? Inside the torchlight, you may ﬁ nd two or more electric cells. Why does the torch lamp glow in one position of its switch? Fig. 3.1: A torchlight"}

Do you notice a positive (+) sign and a negative (–) sign marked on the electric cell? Do you also notice that it has a small protruding metal cap on one side and a ﬂ at metal disc on the other side? All electric cells have two terminals; one is called positive (+ ve) while the other is negative (– ve). The metal cap is the positive terminal of the electric cell and the metal disc is the negative terminal. The electric cell is a portable source of electrical energy. 3.2.2 Battery Activity 3.3: Let us experiment Take a torch which uses two cells. Open its cell compartment and take out the cells. Put the cells back in a diﬀ erent order. Also, try reversing the direction of one cell.

Now, carefully look at the arrangements in which the lamp glows. Compare these with those in which the lamp does not glow. Can you ﬁ nd the reason for the diﬀ erence? 3.2.5 An electrical circuit The lamp glows when one terminal of the lamp is connected to one terminal of the electric cell and the other terminal of the lamp to the other terminal of the cell as shown in Fig. 3.9. This setup forms an electrical circuit, which provides a complete path for electric current to ﬂ ow through the lamp. The lamp glows only when current passes through the circuit. The direction of electric current in an electrical circuit is taken to be from the positive to the negative terminal of the electric cell. When the terminals of the lamp are connected with those of the electric cell by wires, the current passes through the ﬁ lament of the incandescent lamp and makes it glow. With an incandescent lamp, it does not matter which of its terminals connects to the positive or negative terminal of the cell. The lamp will glow as long as the circuit is complete and current ﬂ ows through the ﬁ lament. FASCINATING FACTS Sometimes, an incandescent lamp does not glow even when connected to a cell. We say the lamp has ‘fused’ usually due to a broken ﬁ lament. A broken ﬁ lament stops the ﬂ ow of current, preventing the lamp from glowing. Let us now try to make an LED glow.

Does the LED glow? Repeat the above step but interchange the wires connected to the LED (Fig. 3.10d). Does the LED glow again? You would have observed that the LED glows in the ﬁ rst case (Fig. 3.10c) and does not glow in the other (Fig. 3.10d). It is because the current can pass through the LED in one direction only. The current passes through the LED only when the positive terminal (longer wire) of the LED is connected to the positive terminal of the battery, and negative terminal (shorter wire) of the LED is connected to the negative terminal of the battery. When current passes through the LED, it glows. Always take care to connect an LED correctly in a circuit to make it glow.

Insulators like rubber, plastics, and ceramics are used to cover wires, plug tops, and switches to protect people from electric shocks. Caution — Our body is a conductor of electricity. Electric current passing through our body may cause severe injury or even death. Always handle electrical appliances with care. Never touch switches or plugs with wet hands, or use electrical devices in wet areas, or handle equipment with damaged insulation or broken plugs. Have you ever wondered how the electricity from a cell or battery is diﬀ erent from the electricity coming from a wall socket? Electricity from batteries usually powers small devices and is of a type called Direct Current (DC).

HOLISTIC LENS The impact of iron on the progress of civilisation of India In the Grade 6 Social Science textbook Exploring Society India and Beyond, you learnt about the Harappans. They knew how to use metals like copper and gold. They used these metals to make various objects, from utensils to jewellery. However, you would hardly ﬁ nd any evidence of the Harappans using a very prominent metal iron, which you see a lot around you today. This is because it took a long time before iron was used in day-to-day activities. However, once the use of iron gained prominence in the times that followed, it contributed signiﬁ cantly to the progress of civilisation in India. For instance, due to its strength, agricultural tools like ploughs made from iron were much superior to those used previously. What could be the potential reason that it is generally considered that copper was discovered earlier as compared to iron? w t f I m t 4.1.2 Ductility Where do you ﬁ nd the use of metal wires? You might have seen wires of metals like copper or aluminium in electrical ﬁ ttings. Some ornaments, like bangles, necklaces, earrings, etc., are also made from metal wires. Metal wires play important functions in a variety of stringed musical instruments, such as veena, sitar, violin, and guitar. This property of materials by which they can be drawn into wires is called ductility. This property of ductility is mainly possessed by metals. Gold is so ductile that one gram of it can be drawn into a 2 kilometre-long wire! The ductile nature of metals enables for the creation of this tea strainer with metal wire."}

You may have noticed that the metal spoon is hotter to touch than the wooden spoon. Even though both spoons are immersed in the water of the same temperature and for the same time. This shows that the heat transfers through the metal spoon, making it hotter. In contrast, the wooden spoon transfers heat poorly. In such cases, the transfer of heat from one point to another of a material is called conduction, and materials that transfer heat are called conductors. Based on the observations, one can say that metals are good conductors of heat, whereas wood is a poor conductor of heat. Now, we can understand why mostly metal vessels are used for cooking, and their handles are made with wood or other materials that do not conduct heat. You will learn more about this in the chapter ‘Heat Transfer in Nature’. 4.1.5 Conduction of electricity Have you ever seen an electrician using a screwdriver?

Pour freshly boiled and cooled water (to remove dissolved gases) into it until the iron nail is completely dipped in it. Now, pour some oil to form a layer over the surface of the water (Fig. 4.4b).

It is observed in glass bottles A and B that the iron nails do not show any brown deposits. What does this observation indicate? This indicates that brown deposits or discolouration on the iron nails do not develop when the iron nail is kept in dry air alone (bottle A) or water alone (bottle B). However, in glass bottle C, the iron nail shows the presence of brown deposits. This indicates that the presence of both water and air is essential for these deposits to develop. Thus, moist air is responsible for the development of brown deposits on objects made of iron. This brown deposit is called rust. The process of formation of rust on objects made of iron is called rusting. Many other metals also exhibit discolouration when kept open in the atmosphere. Have you noticed the formation of a green coating on the surface of copper objects or a black coating on the surface of silver objects? Gradual deterioration of metal surfaces caused by air, water, or other substances is known as corrosion. Do you know that rusting of iron is a serious problem in our country? Every year, an enormous amount of money is spent to replace or repair iron structures damaged due to rusting. The rusting of iron can be prevented by several methods such as painting, oiling, greasing, and applying a protective layer of zinc metal on iron (galvanisation). We will learn about this in higher grades. FASCINATING FACTS The wonder of ancient Indian metallurgy! The Iron Pillar of Delhi was made in the time of Chandragupta II more than 1600 years ago.

This carbon dioxide was formed by the carbon from the wax and the oxygen from the air. In other words, oxygen is required for combustion. SCIENCE AND SOCIETY If a person’s clothes catch ﬁ re, what is the best way to extinguish the ﬁ re? Wrap a blanket or cloth around the person. This cuts oﬀ the supply of air, and the ﬁ re gets extinguished. Caution — Synthetic blanket or cloth should never be used to put out a ﬁ re, as these can melt and stick to the skin. FASCINATING FACTS Nature’s wonders: You might have seen some insects emitting light in a garden or a ﬁ eld in late evenings. These insects are called ﬁ reﬂ ies, and their light is produced by a chemical change. This type of light production (without heat) in living organisms is called bioluminescence. Fireflies Fireflies Is the Presence of Air Enough for Combustion? We learnt above that combustible substances and oxygen are necessary for combustion. We also know that paper is a combustible substance, but we can keep it in the air for any length of time without it catching ﬁ re. What else is needed to start combustion? Let us learn about this."}

It quickly catches ﬁ re. Do we say that we need a ﬁ re to start the burning process? Take another piece of paper. Using a magnifying glass, focus the sunrays to make the smallest and brightest spot on the paper, as shown in the Fig. 5.7a. Hold it there for some time. What do you observe? We observe that the paper starts to emit smoke, and then catches ﬁ re (Fig. 5.7b). Thus, we ﬁ nd that a substance can burn even without ﬁ re. How do we explain this change? Focusing sunrays on the paper heats it. The temperature of the paper increases with time. After some time, the paper becomes so hot that it starts burning. This minimum temperature at which a substance catches ﬁ re is called its ignition temperature. Since the temperature of the lighted matchstick was already higher than the ignition temperature of the paper, it caught ﬁ re almost immediately. Fig. 5.7(a): Focusing the sunrays using a magnifying glass Fig. 5.7(b): Paper catching fire So, we can conclude that for the combustion process to occur, there are three requirements (Fig. 5.8) — (i) A combustible substance, also called ‘fuel’ (ii) Oxygen (iii) Heat that allows the fuel to reach its ignition temperature. 5.4 Can Physical and Chemical Changes Occur in the Same Process?

A change that is undesirable in some situations may be desirable in other situations. For example, decomposition of food can be very useful in converting food waste into compost. Some changes occurring over the years due to human activity can have a long-term environmental impact. For example, the increased consumption of fuels in cars, trains, aeroplanes, etc., is increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Drying of paint on walls, doors, furniture, etc., releases many substances through evaporation, causing atmospheric pollution. 5.7 Some Slow Natural Changes g 5.7.1 Weathering of rocks Have you seen heaps of sand, soil, and stones lying at the base of mountains as shown in Fig. 5.10a? These are called sediments. How have these formed? These are formed by physical changes that break up large rocks into smaller pieces. Temperature changes due to climatic conditions, growing roots of trees, and even freezing of water within cracks in the rocks can cause them to break. Water or chemicals present in water, can also react with the rocks and cause chemical changes in their composition. An example of such a chemical change is shown in Fig. 5.10b. Here, an originally black-coloured rock called basalt, which contains iron, has chemically changed to produce a red-coloured layer. The red colour is a result of the iron oxide produced when the rock surface was exposed for a long time to water or air containing water vapour. These physical and chemical changes in rocks are collectively called weathering, which eventually leads to the formation of soil. (a) (b) Fig. 5.10: (a) Sediments at the base of a cliff (b) red sediment layer"}

This sand is formed when rock pebbles, soil, and sediments are broken down and moved from one location to another by natural forces like wind and ﬂ owing water. This process is called erosion. Erosion during a landslide is an example of a physical change. River rocks and pebbles often appear smoother due to the constant erosion caused by the ﬂ owing water. When the speed of the water or wind decreases, such as in an ocean or a lake, the material transported during erosion settles down at the bottom. These sediments harden over time and become new rocks. Most of these changes take place over thousands of years and cannot be reversed. In a Nutshell A physical change is one in which a substance or object undergoes a change in its physical properties and no new substance is formed. A chemical change is one in which one or more new substances are formed. It involves a chemical reaction and can be represented by a chemical equation. Combustion, cooking, and rusting are examples of chemical changes. Substances that undergo combustion are combustible substances. Heat and/or light are given out during combustion. The lowest temperature at which a substance can catch ﬁ re is called its ignition temperature. Some changes can be reversed and some cannot. Some changes are desirable and some are not. Rocks undergo physical and chemical changes due to weathering to form soil. Erosion caused by ﬂ owing water and wind is a physical change."}

With proper nourishment, the seed becomes a sapling and matures into a young plant. This journey is marked by some specific changes. Some of the visible changes are an increase in its height, the appearance of more leaves, and the development of flowers, fruits, and new seeds. From these seeds, new plants emerge. It is quite unlikely that a seedling will develop the capabilities to produce its own seeds immediately after germination. It needs to grow and reach maturity to become capable of producing seeds. Similarly, animals also need to grow and reach maturity before they can reproduce. Some animals lay eggs that hatch into young ones, while others, like humans, directly give birth to young ones. In both cases, the young ones gradually grow in size and develop over time."}

Each person experiences these stages at their own pace, and the duration of each stage may vary from one individual to another. From infancy to adulthood, our bodies undergo various changes. Until around 10–12 years of age, most changes are related to height and weight. After this, other noticeable changes begin to occur, marking the onset of adolescence. This is a period of rapid growth and development, typically occurring between the ages of 10–19. During adolescence, the body prepares for adulthood. Humans, like most other living beings, can not reproduce immediately after their birth. Their bodies need to grow and reach a stage of maturity to be able to reproduce. As humans grow and develop, they experience significant physical, emotional, and behavioural changes, along with the ability to reproduce. Some of these changes may be quite clearly observable, while others occur internally and may go unnoticed. In this chapter, you will explore adolescence, understand its importance, and learn how to handle it with a sense of responsibility. 6.1 Growing With Age: The Teenage Years During the summer vacation, Venkatesh visited his grandparents.

The voice box is a structure in our throat that helps us to speak. The growth may be seen as a bump in the throat region and is called the Adam’s apple. However, it is not noticeable in every individual. The voice box also grows in adolescent girls but it is not as big as in the boys, leading to only slight changes in voice. Changes in facial skin: emergence of pimples Another common occurrence during the adolescent years is a skin condition called acne, in which small, reddish pimples appear. These are commonly visible on the face. Acne occurs due to an increase in oily secretions from the skin during adolescence that can clog the skin pores and lead to infections. While acne is a condition, pimples are a manifestation of it. Appearance of hair in different parts of body Both boys and girls experience the growth of hair in different parts of their bodies, such as the armpits and pubic region. Boys often develop facial hair, which later grows into a moustache and a beard as they move towards adulthood. Some boys may also develop chest hair and back hair, though few boys may have no significant hair growth. Variations in and timing of appearance of hair growth is completely normal. A key point to remember Whether it is a change in height, voice, or facial hair, it is important to recognise that the timing, nature, and extent of these changes vary among individuals.

Some of these characteristic changes, like change in voice, the growth of facial and chest hair in boys, and the development of breasts in girls are not directly involved in the process of reproduction. However, these characteristic changes help distinguish males from females. For this reason, they are called secondary sexual characteristics. Secondary sexual characteristics are natural signs that the body is preparing for adulthood. They mark the onset of puberty. Puberty is the stage in which the body of an adolescent undergoes external and internal changes to develop into an adult capable of reproduction. 6.2 Changes that Indicate Reproductive Capability Adolescence is marked not only by observable changes but also by internal changes that are not visible from the outside. One such change is the maturation of various parts involved in the process of reproduction. Both boys and girls experience such changes gradually, and these changes are a natural part of the process of growing up. An important internal change associated with adolescent girls is the onset of the menstrual cycle. It recurs generally every 28–30 days and is more commonly known as ‘the period’. Many healthy girls may have longer or shorter menstrual cycles ranging from 21–35 days. The menstrual cycle is an important natural process and is one of the signs of good reproductive health. The phase of the cycle when blood discharge occurs from the body is referred to as menstruation. It may last for three to seven days. Some girls may feel pain or discomfort in the lower abdomen during these days. Usually, by the age of 45–55, menstruation stops naturally, marking the end of the reproductive capability in a woman’s life. Breaking myths about menstruation There are many wrong beliefs about menstruation that often lead to unnecessary fear, shame, or even guilt. These beliefs have given rise to certain myths and taboos. Among such myths and taboos, physical isolation of menstruating girls is unfortunately still quite prevalent. Menstruation is a natural process, and such myths have no scientific basis. By encouraging a scientific outlook towards menstruation, we can help society appreciate the need to promote good reproductive health of women and contribute positively towards a healthier lifestyle for women."}

Maintaining body hygiene, particularly in the armpits and the pubic region, may protect us from potential infections. For girls, maintaining proper hygiene during menstruation is essential for both comfort and health. Menstrual hygiene can be maintained using items such as sanitary pads (Fig. 6.1) and reusable cloth pads designed for this purpose. The government also attempts to provide these products free of charge or at a low price to improve the menstrual hygiene of girls and women. As a society, we should all make efforts to ensure the availability of necessary facilities in schools and public places to promote menstrual hygiene. Collectively, we should move forward, reducing any stigma around sanitary pads and helping in menstrual hygiene. It is important to dispose of used sanitary pads properly by wrapping them in newspaper and disposing inside a dustbin. This is to ensure community health and environmental cleanliness. These days, biodegradable sanitary pads are also available that are environment-friendly. Fig. 6.1: Sanitary pad"}

We now understand the different changes in adolescence and also know some ways to handle it with a sense of responsibility. Many changes in adolescence, including menstruation and other signs of puberty, are mainly due to hormones — certain chemicals produced in our bodies. Hormones play a crucial role in regulating various aspects of growth and development, contributing to the proper functioning of the body. They are produced in different parts of the body and are released at an appropriate time in response to signals from the brain. Some hormones influence mood and behaviour."}

Why does pin I fall before pin II? Why did all the pins not fall together? From your observations, what can you infer? Do you think that heat is being transferred along the metal strip from the end that is being heated? As the heat travels along the strip and approaches a pin, the wax holding it melts and the pin falls. Here, the transfer of heat takes place from the hot end of the strip to the colder end. The process of heat transfer from the hotter part of an object to the colder part is called conduction. In this process, the particle that gets heated, passes the heat on to its neighbour, and so on. However, the particles themselves do not move from their positions. Materials like metals that allow heat to pass through them easily are called good conductors of heat. Because metals are good conductors of heat, we use utensils made of metals for cooking. In solids, heat transfer takes place mainly through the process of conduction. If we use a strip made of a material like wood or glass in place of a metal strip to perform Activity 7.1, the pins will not fall. Can you think of the reason for this based on our learning from the chapter ‘The World of Metals and Non-Metals’?

The presence of air between two thin blankets is the reason why we prefer them over one thick blanket to keep us warm (Fig. 7.2). Is it possible to construct houses that are not aﬀ ected much by the outside heat and cold? Houses constructed in places with a very hot or cold climate often use the concept of heat transfer to keep them cool or warm. FASCINATING FACTS The upper regions of the Himalayas, such as the Mori block of Uttarkashi in Uttarakhand, experience an extremely cold climate and heavy snowfall during winters. Houses here are often built to stay warm during winters, with walls made of two wooden layers ﬁ lled with cow dung and mud between them. As wood and mud are poor conductors of heat, they prevent heat loss and help in keeping the houses warm.

Table 7.3: Recording observations and probable reasons Observation about the cups Probable reasons for the observation You observed that the cup under which the candle was placed, rises up (Fig. 7.3b). Why is it so? The air around the candle ﬂ ame heats up. As the air in the cup warms up, it expands and occupies more space. As a result, it becomes lighter and rises up. You can experience the expansion of air on heating it by placing a partially inﬂ ated balloon in the Sun (Fig. 7.4). After the air in the balloon gets heated, it expands and the balloon becomes larger. You must have observed that when an incense stick (agarbatti) is burnt, smoke rises up.

Why does the streak of coloured water go up in the middle and come down from the sides? The water at the bottom of the beaker gets heated up and becomes hot. It expands, becomes lighter, and rises. The water on the sides of the beaker is comparatively cooler and heavier, and comes down to take the place of the rising water. Then, this water gets heated and in turn also rises. This cycle continues until the entire volume of water gets heated. In this case, the entire volume of water gets heated through the actual movement of water particles. This process of heat transfer is known as convection. It is because of convection that we see the movement of the coloured streak inside the beaker.

After letting the soil and water get heated, bring the set-up indoors and let it cool for 20 minutes. You will observe that the soil cools faster than water, just as it gets heated faster. People living in coastal areas experience an interesting phenomenon caused by the heating and cooling of land and water at diﬀ erent rates. As the land gets heated faster than water during the day, it causes warm air above the land to rise. This causes cooler air to move from the sea towards the land. This movement of cooler air from the sea to the land is called sea breeze (Fig. 7.7a). Hence, in hot places, sea breeze relieves people from the heat.

Thus, people living near the seashore experience that the direction of the wind reverses in the day and night. 7.3 Radiation Do you remember when Pema and Palden were sitting around the ﬁ replace? They felt warm. Their grandfather tells them that the heat transfer, in this case, takes place directly from the ﬁ re (hot object) to us by a process known as radiation. The heat of the Sun reaches us through this process. Heat transfer by radiation does not require any medium. All objects radiate heat. You must have observed that a hot utensil kept away from the ﬂ ame cools down after some time. What is the reason for it? The hot utensil cools down by radiating heat to its surroundings. Why is it more comfortable to wear white or light-coloured clothes during summers and dark-coloured clothes during winters? Light-coloured clothes reﬂ ect most of the heat that falls on them, and therefore, we feel more comfortable wearing them during summers.

Heat is transferred from the ﬂ ame to the utensil by conduction. Subsequently, water in the utensil gets heated up by convection. The warmth that we feel around the ﬂ ame and the hot utensil is due to radiation. Let us wrap up! From the activities, examples, and discussions so far, we ﬁ nd that there are three processes by which heat gets transferred. These are conduction, convection, and radiation. In conduction, heating takes place when one particle receives heat, transfers heat to the next particle in contact, and so on. The particles themselves do not move away from their positions. In convection, heat transfer takes place by the actual movement of particles. Note that in conduction and convection, a medium must be present whose particles help in the transfer of heat. In the case of radiation, heat travels from one place to another and no material medium is required for its transfer.

You have seen your parents drying wet clothes on the clothesline at home. Wet clothes dry faster on a sunny day since the heat from the Sun makes the evaporation of water faster. Thus, heat from the Sun plays an important role in the evaporation of water, be it from clothes drying on a line or from water bodies like oceans and lakes. Let us look at the phenomenon of water cycle to understand this in more detail. 7.4 Water Cycle y You have also learnt in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity, that water exists in three states in nature. As a liquid, it ﬁ lls the oceans, rivers, and lakes on the Earth. As a solid, it forms snow, ice sheets, and glaciers in the mountains and the polar regions. As a gas, it exists in the form of water vapour in the Earth’s atmosphere. During summers, some of the snow and ice gets converted to water due to the Sun’s radiation and ﬂ ows down as rivers, and ultimately into the oceans. The melted ice is replenished by fresh snow during winters. Water in the oceans, rivers, and lakes gets heated due to the Sun, and as a result, it evaporates as water vapour. Water also evaporates from trees and plants through transpiration. When water vapour rises up, it cools down and condenses to form clouds. Clouds bring rain, snow, and hail. This process is called precipitation. The continuous movement of water — upward as water vapour and downward through precipitation, passing through soil, rocks, and plants, and ﬁ nally returning to water bodies, is called water cycle (Fig. 7.9). Thus, the water cycle helps in redistributing and replenishing water in rivers, lakes, and oceans. It also serves to conserve the total amount of water on the Earth. Rainwater that falls on the surface of the Earth, ﬂ ows into ponds, lakes, rivers, and oceans or seeps into the ground.

You may have observed that water seeps fastest through gravel, slower through sand, and slowest through clay. Why is it so? The spaces between gravel particles are wider when compared to those in sand and clay. Hence, water can seep through the gravel more easily. In this way, water seeps beneath the surface of the Earth. This process of surface water seeping through soil and rocks is called inﬁ ltration. Water can inﬁ ltrate more readily if the spaces between soil and rock particles are wider, open, and interconnected (Fig. 7.11). The water that seeps through gets stored in the pore spaces of sediments and the openings in rocks beneath the surface as groundwater. The underground layers of sediments and rocks that store water in pore spaces are called aquifers (Fig. 7.12). This is the water we extract by digging wells or drilling bore wells into aquifers. This water may be a few metres to hundreds of metres below the ground, depending on the location. Fig. 7.12: Aquifer Rain Inﬁ ltration Well Aquifer However, groundwater is not unlimited. The growing water requirements of an increasing population have led to excessive groundwater extraction. Additionally, decreased vegetation cover and increased concrete surfaces in urban areas have limited water inﬁ ltration. As a result, groundwater is getting depleted. To address this, rainwater harvesting and recharge pits are used to replenish groundwater. Hence, the water cycle ensures that groundwater sources are recharged, thereby helping to ensure a sustainable groundwater supply.

During winters, water from mountain streams is channeled down through underground pipes. This water is then sprayed into the cold air. As it falls, it freezes due to extremely low temperatures.

They started noticing that many events in nature repeat themselves after deﬁ nite intervals of time. For example, the rising and setting of the Sun, the phases of the Moon and the changing seasons. They started using the cycles of these events for timekeeping. First, they devised calendars. A day was deﬁ ned by the cycle of rising and setting of the Sun. Then began the quest to ﬁ nd ways of knowing the time of day. How was time measured when there were no clocks and watches? So, they made many devices which helped them to measure smaller intervals of time within a day. Some of these were sundials, water clocks, hourglasses, and candle clocks. In a sundial, time is determined with the changing position of the shadow of an object cast by the light of the Sun during the day (Fig. 8.1). The water clocks used the ﬂ ow of water out or into a vessel to measure time. In one type, water ﬂ owed out from a vessel which had markings for time (Fig. 8.2a). In the other type, there would be a bowl, with a ﬁ ne hole at the bottom, which was ﬂ oated on the surface of water (Fig. 8.2b). It gradually ﬁ lled up in a ﬁ xed time and ﬁ nally sank. Then, it was lifted up and ﬂ oated again. In an hourglass (Fig. 8.3), time was measured on the basis of the ﬂ ow of sand from one bulb to another. Candle clocks (Fig. 8.4) were candles with markings that indicated the passage of time when burned.

The earliest reference to shadow-based time measurement appears in the Arthasastra by Kautilya (was composed and revised between the second century BCE – third century CE). An accurate expression for time in terms of the shadow of a vertical stick was given by Varahamihira around 530 CE. The water clock with water ﬂ owing out was described in the Arthasastra, Sardulakarnavadana, and some other texts (early CE centuries). These clocks were not very accurate because as water levels dropped, the ﬂ ow rate decreased. This led to the development of the sinking bowl water clock (Fig. 8.2b), or Ghatika-yantra, ﬁ rst mentioned by Aryabhata, and then in several astronomical texts later. Time was measured constantly with Ghatika-yantra at Buddhist monasteries, royal palaces, town squares, and each time the bowl sank, it was announced by drums, conch shells, or striking a gong. Though the Ghatika-yantra was progressively replaced by pendulum clocks in the late nineteenth century, it continued to be used at the religious places for rituals. n y n , s h Fig. 8.6: Huygens’ Pendulum clock Pendulum As human civilisation advanced, and as people began to travel long distances, the measurement of time became very critical. This led to the development of increasingly better mechanical devices for the measurement of time, driven by weights, gears, and springs from the fourteenth century onwards. However, the invention of the pendulum clock in the seventeenth century marked a major breakthrough in mechanical timekeeping. KNOW A SCIENTIST The pendulum clock was invented in 1656 and patented in 1657 by Christiaan Huygens (1629 –1695). He was inspired by the investigations of pendulums by Galileo Galilei (1564 –1642). It is said that once while sitting in a church, Galileo’s attention was drawn to a lamp suspended from the ceiling, which was swinging back and forth. Using his pulse to measure time, Galileo found that the lamp took the same time for each swing. After experimenting with diﬀ erent pendulums, Galileo concluded that the time taken to complete one oscillation was always the same for a pendulum of a given length.

When the bob of the pendulum is moved slightly to one side and released, it starts oscillatory motion. Its motion is periodic in nature because it repeats its path after a ﬁ xed interval of time. The pendulum is said to have completed one oscillation when its bob, starting from its mean position O, moves to extreme position A, changes direction and moves to another extreme position B, changes direction and comes back to O (Fig. 8.7b). The pendulum also completes one oscillation when its bob moves from one extreme position A to another extreme position B and comes back to A. The time taken by the pendulum to complete one oscillation is called its time period. Let us now set up a pendulum and measure its time period.

In music, digital recordings capture sound thousands of times per second for smooth playback.

Animals eat diﬀ erent types of food. Bees and sunbirds suck the nectar of ﬂ owers, while infants of humans and many other animals feed on their mother’s milk. Snakes, like python, swallow the animals they prey upon. Some aquatic animals ﬁ lter tiny food particles ﬂ oating nearby and feed upon them. Animals, including humans, obtain energy from food, which enables them to carry out various life processes. Animals consume food that contains complex components, such as carbohydrate, protein, and fat. These complex food components have to be broken down into simpler forms before the body can use them. But how does this process happen? Breaking down of complex food components into simpler forms occurs in a long tube called the alimentary canal. This process starts in the mouth and ends at the anus (Fig. 9.1). As food moves through this canal, digestive juices secreted at diﬀ erent parts break it down into simpler forms. This simpler form of food is absorbed by diﬀ erent parts of our alimentary canal and transported to various parts of our body to carry out various functions. 9.1 Nutrition in Animals How do the complex food components get broken down into simpler forms and used by the body in various animals? Is this process the same in all animals or does it vary? Let us ﬁ rst try to understand this process in humans. 9.1.1 Digestion in human beings Let us trace the journey of food inside our body as it passes through diﬀ erent parts of the alimentary canal. Beginning with the mouth cavity The journey of the food you eat begins when it enters your mouth. Your teeth break down food you eat into smaller pieces by the processes of crushing and chewing. This process of initial breakdown of food into ﬁ ne pieces is called mechanical digestion. Think about your favourite food. Does your mouth feel watery?

At ﬁ rst, the chapati or rice has its usual taste, but as you continue chewing, do you notice a change in taste? The food begins to taste sweet! Have you ever wondered why this happens? Chapati or rice contains starch, which is a type of carbohydrate. Our saliva contains a digestive juice that helps break down starch into sugar. This explains why starchy food, like chapati, tastes sweet when you chew it for a long time. Saliva helps to break down components of food into simpler ones.

What causes the change of colour in test tube A? In Grade 6, we learned that iodine gives a blue-black colour when it reacts with starch. In test tube A, the appearance of the blue-black colour indicates the presence of starch. In test tube B, which contains chewed boiled rice, if there is no change in colour, it indicates that the starch is no longer present; if there is only a slight change in colour, it indicates that starch is present only in very small amount. It has been broken down into simple sugars by the action of saliva. If the colour still appears in test tube B, what changes would you make in the activity to explore it further? Would the colour change if chewing time is increased? Try to ﬁ nd out by repeating the activity. Now, we know that saliva secretion in the mouth helps break down starch into sugars. This process of breaking complex food components into simpler forms in the body is called digestion. Food is partially digested in the mouth. Let us learn how this partially digested food gets further digested through the alimentary canal. Food pipe (Oesophagus): A passage from the mouth to the stomach When you chew your food, your saliva not only helps in digesting the starch but also moistens it, making it soft and easy to swallow. Your tongue helps in mixing chewed food with saliva and pushing this softened food into a long, ﬂ exible tube called the food pipe or oesophagus (Fig. 9.2). But how does the food move down? The walls of the food pipe gently contract and relax in a wave-like motion to push the food down into the stomach. This movement takes place throughout the alimentary canal and pushes the food forward. Stomach In the stomach, the walls contract and relax to churn the food. The churned food is then mixed with a secretion from the inner lining of the stomach. The secretion from stomach contains digestive juice, acid, and mucus.

The acid not only helps break down proteins but also kills many harmful bacteria. The mucus protects the stomach lining from the acid, preventing damage. In the stomach, the food is partially digested and transformed into a semi-liquid mass, preparing it for the next stage of digestion. Fig. 9.3: Stomach Digestive juice, acid and mucus Stomach wall FASCINATING FACTS How did scientists learn about digestion in the human body? The discovery of how the stomach works happened by chance. In 1822, a man named Alexis St. Martin was accidentally shot in the stomach. He was treated by a doctor, William Beaumont. However, his wound never fully healed, leaving a small permanent hole. This opening allowed Dr. Beaumont to observe digestion in the stomach as it happened. He conducted experiments on how diﬀ erent foods were broken down and studied how emotions aﬀ ect digestion. Alexis St. Martin’s shotgun wound Small Intestine After its journey through the stomach, the partially digested food moves into the small intestine. Look at Fig. 9.4. It is a sketch of a stretched-out alimentary canal. Guess how long it is. You will be surprised that although it is called small intestine, it is almost 6 metres long—almost twice the height of your classroom! You will be surprised to know that the small intestine is the longest part of the alimentary canal. The small intestine receives digestive secretions from three sources—the inner lining of the small intestine itself, and two more structures associated with the alimentary canal—the liver and the pancreas (Fig. 9.4). The liver secretes bile, which is mildly basic in nature. Recall the neutralisation reaction in chapter ‘Exploring Substances: Acidic, Basic, and Neutral’. Bile neutralises acids present in the food moving down from the stomach and breaks down fats into tiny droplets, making its digestion easier.

Additionally, pancreatic juice also breaks down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. The digestive juice secreted by the wall of the small intestine further breaks down fats, proteins, and partially digested carbohydrates into simpler forms. The digested nutrients pass on from the small intestine into the blood present in blood vessels found in the walls of the small intestine. This process is called absorption of nutrients. How are these nutrients absorbed from the small intestine? The inner lining of the small intestine is thin and has thousands of ﬁ nger-like projections (Fig. 9.5) that increase the surface area for eﬃ cient nutrient absorption. These ﬁ nger-like projections allow the digested nutrients to pass into the blood, which carries them to diﬀ erent parts of the body. These nutrients provide energy, support growth and repair, and help the body function properly. Fig. 9.5: Inner lining of the small intestine 0.5 mm Large intestine After most of the nutrients are digested and absorbed in the small intestine, what happens to the undigested food? It moves into the large intestine. The large intestine is about 1.5 metres in length. It is shorter than the small intestine. Then why is it called the large intestine? The reason is that it is wider than the SCIENCE AND SOCIETY Celiac disease is a condition in which the body reacts to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. This reaction damages the inner lining of the small intestine, where nutrients are absorbed. As a result, the intestine cannot function properly. The only way to manage celiac disease is to avoid foods that contain gluten. Millets (like jowar, bajra, and ragi) are good alternatives because they are naturally gluten-free."}

The large intestine absorbs water and some salts from the undigested food, thus making the waste semi-solid. This semi-solid waste is called stool. The stool is then stored in the lower part of the large intestine, called the rectum, until the body is ready to get rid of it. Eating ﬁ bre-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains helps the large intestine function properly by making the stool easier to pass. Finally, it is expelled through the anus—a process known as egestion. This is how your body removes the waste it does not need, keeping you healthy! Isn’t it fascinating how the digestive system works, absorbing nutrients from food and eliminating waste? FASCINATING FACTS The large intestine contains various small living organisms, such as bacteria, that help in digestion. They help in keeping our digestive system healthy. They break down undigested food, especially ﬁ bre, and produce essential nutrients. Fibre-rich food, and especially ‘fermented foods’ (like curd, buttermilk, shrikhand, kanji, pickles, gundruk, and poita bhat) are good for a healthy digestive system and overall well-being. SCIENCE AND SOCIETY The importance of digestion in maintaining good health has been recognised for centuries. The Charaka Samhita, an ancient Ayurvedic text, highlights the role of easily digestible foods and the judicious use of spices like ginger, black pepper, and cumin to enhance digestion. Advances in science in the area of nutrition also emphasise eating meals at proper timings, practising mindful eating, and avoiding overeating as key factors in maintaining digestive health. 9.1.2 Do all animals digest food the same way as humans do?

In the stomach, partial digestion of the food takes place. The partially digested food is brought back to the mouth for gradual chewing. This process is called rumination, and these animals are called ruminants. A cow spends about 8 hours a day just chewing the food! The thoroughly chewed food again passes down the alimentary canal for further digestion. Fig. 9.6: Digestive system of a ruminant Oesophagus Small Intestine Rumen Pancreas Fig. 9.7: Digestive system in birds Fig 9 7: Digestive system in b Gizzard Intestine Stomach Oesophagus Birds do not have teeth, but they have a chamber called a gizzard (Fig. 9.7).

This shows that animals exhibit variations in the structure and function of the alimentary canal to adapt to diﬀ erent ways of digesting diﬀ erent kinds of food. We have learnt that the nutrients from digested food are carried to diﬀ erent parts of the body. Some of the nutrients help build and repair the body, while others, like sugar, are broken down inside the body to release energy.

How is this oxygen used in the body? Are breathing and respiration diﬀ erent? Let us ﬁ nd out. How do we breathe? The process of inhaling and exhaling air is called breathing. It is diﬃ cult to live without food for a week; without water for a day or two, but without breathing, we usually cannot survive more than a few minutes. Why is that? All of us are alive because we breathe. Not just humans, plants and other animals also breathe. But how do we breathe? Just as food follows a speciﬁ c pathway in the digestive system, our body also has a speciﬁ c system for breathing and respiration. This system is called respiratory system. The respiratory system consists of various parts as shown in Fig. 9.8. In this system, the exchange of gases follows a speciﬁ c pathway. The pathway through which the air is inhaled and exhaled involves various parts of the respiratory system assisting in the process of breathing and respiration. The respiratory system begins with a pair of nasal openings called nostrils through which we inhale and exhale air (Fig. 9.8). The inhaled air passes into a pair of small passages called the nasal passages. Have you noticed tiny hair inside your nostrils? These hair, along with mucus, help trap dust and dirt from the air we breathe in. This is why we should breathe through the nose and not through the mouth. From the nasal passages, the air reaches our lungs through the windpipe. The windpipe forms two branches, which enter the two lungs. In the lungs, these branches further divide into smaller and ﬁ ner branches that end in small balloon-like sacs called alveoli (Fig. 9.8). Our lungs are protected by the rib cage. Rib cage Left lung Right lung Diaphragm Windpipe Alveoli Nostrils Fig. 9.8: Human respiratory system SCIENCE AND SOCIETY While a lot of the dust is ﬁ ltered out from the inhaled air, often small infectious particles can get through the lungs. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 virus aﬀ ected the respiratory system, leading to breathing diﬃ culties and often causing serious lung problems."}

Pranayama is well known for improving respiratory health, mind relaxation, and concentration.

Through the process of breathing, fresh air from outside enters the lungs and ﬁ lls the alveoli. The alveoli have thin walls surrounded by ﬁ ne tubes containing blood (Fig. 9.12). Blood carries carbon dioxide from the body to the alveoli, where it is released into the air. At the same time, oxygen from the alveoli passes into the blood and is transported to all parts of the body. Have you ever wondered how the food you eat gives you energy? The key is not only the food but also the oxygen we breathe! When we eat food, our body breaks it down into simple substances like sugar (glucose). Oxygen helps break down glucose to release energy. This process is called respiration. The word equation of the process of respiration is as follows— Glucose + Oxygen Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy During breathing, we inhale air from our surroundings and exhale air having more carbon dioxide than the inhaled air. Note that not all the oxygen is used up (Fig. 9.13). Some other animals can use a larger fraction of the oxygen during respiration. This exchange of gases ensures that each segment of our body gets oxygen to produce energy and remove waste products. In simple words, breathing brings in oxygen and removes carbon dioxide, while respiration uses oxygen to break down food and release energy. This energy helps us walk, run, play, and even think! Breathing is a physical process, while respiration is a chemical process that occurs inside the body. Both the processes are essential for our survival!

It damages the lungs and increases the risk of serious diseases, including lung cancer and other respiratory illnesses. It leads to persistent coughing and frequent infections. In addition to harming the smoker, smoking releases toxic chemicals into the air, putting others at risk. When non-smokers inhale this polluted air, they experience passive smoking, which can be especially dangerous for children, pregnant women, and the elderly. Due to these risks, avoiding smoking helps protect both personal health and the well-being of those around us. 9.2.2 Do other animals breathe the same way as humans do? You have learnt that diﬀ erent animals live in diﬀ erent habitats. You may have observed birds ﬂ ying and ﬁ sh swimming. How do they breathe? Animals, such as birds, elephants, lions, cows, goats, lizards, and snakes, breathe through their lungs. Although all these animals have lungs, the structure of their lungs are quite diﬀ erent. Most aquatic animals like ﬁ sh, have specialised structures known as gills (Fig. 9.14). These are richly supplied with blood vessels. The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the blood and the gases dissolved in water takes place across the gills. Amphibians, like frogs, live both on land and in water. They use diﬀ erent body parts for breathing at various stages of their life. For example, tadpoles breathe through gills, while adult frogs use lungs for breathing on land and skin for gas exchange when they stay in water. This adaptation helps them survive both in water and on land, showing how animals have adapted over time to diﬀ erent environments. Earthworms use their moist skin for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Gills Fig. 9.14: Breathing body parts in a ﬁ sh"}

It records useful observations about plant growth, soil, and agricultural practices to help improve crop health, growth and production. The knowledge in the text seems to be based on practical experiences and patterns seen over time. These ideas were then systematically documented to guide farming practices. For instance, there are references to diﬀ erent methods of organic manure preparation, such as mixing water, barley, and various seeds, like green, black, and horse grams. ds to he er ng ic ke 10.2 How Do Plants Get Food for their Growth? We know that animals get their food from plants, either directly by eating plants or indirectly by eating animals that in turn eat plants for their nutrition and growth. But how do plants obtain the food they need to grow? Unlike animals, plants do not eat food. 10.2.1 Leaves: the ̒ food factories̓ of plants Plants store food in the form of starch, a type of carbohydrate. This starch is produced in the leaves of a plant which, by design, are generally broad and ﬂ at. These are mostly green because of the presence of a green pigment called chlorophyll, that helps in capturing sunlight eﬃ ciently. Let us ﬁ nd out the role chlorophyll plays in the preparation of food in the form of starch in plants. p Activity 10.2: Let us check (demonstration activity) The teacher may demonstrate this activity. Keep a leaf in boiling water for ﬁ ve minutes to soften it. Dip this leaf in a test tube containing alcohol. Place the test tube in a beaker containing boiling water.

Caution — Alcohol should never be placed near a heat source directly, as it is highly ﬂ ammable and can easily lead to ﬁ re and burns. Did you wonder why we decolourise the leaf in the beginning of this activity? Decolourisation of a leaf enables us to easily observe colour change and, thus, the presence of starch.

Bhaskar loves gardening during his free time. Being a curious student, he often looks around his garden and wonders how plants produce food. From his experiences, Bhaskar knows that water and sunlight are essential for plant growth. But he wonders if sunlight contributes to the production of food in the form of starch in plants. How does sunlight contribute in the production of starch in plants? Activity 10.3: Let us check Bhaskar took a leaf having both green and non-green patches from each of two similar potted plants — one kept in sunlight and the other kept in the dark for 36 hours. He wanted to compare the leaves before and after the starch test. He made a sketch of the leaves to record the location of the green and the non-green patches on them with the help of a tracing paper.

Non-green patches of the leaf obtained from the plant placed in sunlight do not turn blue-black. Does it indicate that there is no chlorophyll present in those patches? The non-green patches may not have suﬃ cient chlorophyll to prepare enough starch to be detected using the iodine test.

Based on our learnings so far, we have found that sunlight, water, chlorophyll and carbon dioxide are essential for the synthesis of food in plants.

During photosynthesis, food is actually produced in the form of glucose, a simple carbohydrate. This glucose not only serves as an instant source of energy but also later gets converted into starch for storage. The word equation of photosynthesis is given below — Sunlight Carbon dioxide + Water Glucose + Oxygen Chlorophyll KNOW A SCIENTIST Many scientists across the world contributed to develop an understanding of photosynthesis. In India, Rustom Hormusji Dastur (1896–1961) studied the process of photosynthesis. He was a plant scientist and served as the head of the Botany Department at the Royal Institute of Science, Bombay (now the Institute of Science, Mumbai), from 1921–1935. He studied eﬀ ects of the amount of water and temperature on photosynthesis. He examined the importance of water, temperature, and the colour of light in the process of photosynthesis. 10.2.4 How do leaves exchange gases during photosynthesis?

Plants use water in the process of photosynthesis. Water, along with minerals present in the soil, is taken up by the roots of a plant. Minerals are important nutrients for the growth of plants. How do water and minerals taken up by the roots move to all parts of the plant? We can study water transport in plants by carrying out an activity. For this activity, we require two glass tumblers, some water, red ink, and twigs of two similar tender plants, preferably with white-coloured ﬂ owers (for example, white sadabahar, balsam), as shown in Fig. 10.7.

Observe the cut stem using a magnifying glass. Do you spot the red colour in the stem (Fig. 10.7e)? How does the red colour ink move upwards? This is due to the thin tube-like structure called the xylem present in the stem, branches, and leaves of plants. Just like red ink, minerals dissolved in water also move up the stem through the xylem. Now, we know that water and minerals are transported to the leaves and other parts of plants through the xylem (Fig. 10.8). The water transported through the xylem is used to perform various functions. How does food get transported to other parts of a plant? 10.3.2 Transport of food We know that leaves are the primary site for photosynthesis.

In the middle of nineteenth century, another scientist, Leon Foucault, used a long pendulum to give the ﬁ rst simple demonstration of the Earth’s rotation. The pendulum, known as a Foucault pendulum in his honour, consists of a long string with a heavy bob, suspended from a high ceiling. A Foucault pendulum with a length of 22 metres has been hung from a skylight in the Constitution Hall of the new Parliament building in New Delhi, India.

Let us look at the stars in the night sky to see the eﬀ ect of Earth’s rotation. Activity 12.3: Let us explore On an early evening between March and May, identify the Big Dipper (Saptarishi), and the Pole Star (Dhruva Tara), if visible, as you did in the chapter ‘Beyond Earth’ in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity. Note down your location and date of your night sky observations. The activity must be carried out on the same night. Draw the orientation of the Big Dipper in the sky with respect to the Pole Star (or a ﬁ xed tree/building on the ground in a direction towards the Big Dipper if you cannot see the Pole Star). Mark the time of your observation along with your sketch as shown in Fig. 12.7. After two hours, observe the Big Dipper again. Has it moved? Again, draw its orientation and note down the time. Repeat the above step after two hours. Do you observe that the Big Dipper appears to move around the Pole Star (notice just the movement even if you cannot see the Pole Star)? The Earth’s axis of rotation points very close to the Pole Star in the Northern Hemisphere. Therefore, the Pole Star appears nearly stationary in the sky from the Earth. All the stars appear to move around it. Just like the Sun, the Moon also appears to rise in the eastward direction and set in the westward direction because the Earth rotates from West to East.

Aryabhata was a famous mathematician and astronomer of ancient India who wrote an important treatise, Aryabhatiya, around the ﬁ fth century CE. The apparent motion of the stars due to the rotation of the Earth is explained in Verse 9, Golapada, Aryabhatiya. ¥ÙéÜæð×»çÌÙæñüSÍÑ ÂàØˆØ¿Ü¢ çßÜæð×»¢ ØmÌ÷ïÐ ¥¿ÜæçÙ ÖæçÙ ÌmÌ÷ï â×Âçp×»æçÙ ÜVæØæ×÷ïH Just as a man in a boat moving forward sees stationary objects as moving backwards, so also the stars that are stationary are seen by people of Lanka as moving towards the west. Aryabhata’s stated value for the time taken by the Earth to complete one full rotation about its axis is around 23 hours 56 minutes 4.1 seconds (in modern units). This value is impressively close to the currently accepted value. I have seen that the stars and constellations that appear in the East at sunset change during diﬀ erent months. Yes. Maybe that is why we were told to look for certain stars and constellations at certain times of the year in Grade 6. But, why do diﬀ erent stars appear in the night sky over the course of a year? 12.2 Revolution of the Earth While rotating on its own axis, the Earth also revolves around the Sun as we learnt in Grade 6.

The Earth completes one revolution around the Sun in about 365 days and 6 hours. 12.2.1 Changing view of night sky from the Earth Every evening the Sun sets in the westward direction and the night sky becomes visible. We know that this occurs due to the Earth’s rotation. As the Earth also revolves around the Sun continuously, the stars seen in the night sky after sunset gradually change over a year as we look in diﬀ erent directions, as shown in Fig. 12.8.

Is it related to the revolution of the Earth around the Sun in some way? I have also noticed that days are longer in summer than in winter. The Earth’s axis of rotation is not upright with respect to the orbit, but is tilted. The Earth maintains this tilt as it orbits around the Sun (Fig. 12.9). The tilt of the Earth’s axis and the spherical shape of the Earth gives rise to seasons. Let us ﬁ nd out, how.

As seen in Fig. 12.10a, a given amount of sunrays are spread in a smaller area in the Northern Hemisphere as compared to the Southern Hemisphere due to the spherical shape of the Earth’s surface. So that area is heated more. Further, the Northern Hemisphere receives sunlight for more than 12 hours in June (Fig. 12.11a). So, the Northern Hemisphere experiences more intense sunlight, which lasts for a longer time, causing the summer season. In December, the situation is opposite in the Northern Hemisphere and it experiences winter season with sunlight for shorter time (Fig. 12.10b and Fig. 12.11b)."}

Two incorrect reasons often given to explain why seasons occur on the Earth are: When the Northern Hemisphere tilts towards the Sun, it is closer to the Sun. The orbit of the Earth is an oval with the Sun slightly displaced from its centre so the Earth is at diﬀ erent distances from the Sun over the year. However, the diﬀ erence in distances in either of these cases is very small and these are not the reasons why seasons occur on the Earth. In fact, the Earth is closest to the Sun in January.

After the summer solstice, the duration of a day becomes shorter while that of a night becomes longer. The shortest day and longest night in this Hemisphere occur around 22 December known as the winter solstice. Around 21 March and 23 September, the daytime lasts for 12 hours. In the Northern Hemisphere, these days are called the spring and the autumn equinox, respectively. DIVE EEPER FASCINATING FACTS At the North Pole, the Sun rises in the East direction on the equinox day — 21 March, and remains continuously in the sky for six months. The Sun sets on 22 September. The South Pole experiences the opposite behaviour. The polar regions thus experience continuous sunshine for six months followed by a six-month period of darkness. F A d T b s On the equator, there is always 12 hours of sunlight and 12 hours of darkness. There is little diﬀ erence in the intensity of the sunrays falling on the equator in diﬀ erent months. Thus, for the southern states of India that lie close to the equator, the eﬀ ect of seasons is not very prominent. Other eﬀ ects, such as local geographical features and proximity to oceans or seas, can also inﬂ uence these broader patterns seen in the two hemispheres, as you have learnt in social science. 12.3 Eclipses p Day and night cycle, seasons, the life on the Earth... so much is dependent upon the Sun. Could the light from the Sun get blocked by the two planets which are revolving between the Earth and the Sun? The planets Mercury and Venus appear very small compared to the Sun, and never block the entire light from the Sun reaching us. However, you may be surprised to know that the Moon can do that. Do you remember studying in Grade 6 that the Moon is a natural satellite of the Earth and it revolves around the Earth as the Earth revolves around the Sun?"}

This is known as a solar eclipse. You may wonder how the Moon, which is smaller than the Sun, blocks the light coming from the Sun that we see in the sky. Activity 12.4: Let us explore Ask your friend to stand in front of you at a distance of about 5 metres. Consider his head to be the Sun. Now close one eye and show a thumbs up with your outstretched hand towards your friend as shown in Fig. 12.12. Are you able to cover the entire head of your friend with your thumb? You can cover the entire head of your friend with the help of your thumb, even though your thumb is much smaller than the actual size of your friend’s head. How could it be? The size of any object as seen by your eye — also known as apparent size — depends upon both its actual physical size and its distance from you. The thumb being much closer to you as compared to your friend, the apparent sizes of your thumb and your friend’s head as seen by you in Activity 12.4 are similar. The apparent sizes of the Moon and the Sun in the sky are similar when viewed from the Earth. This is so because though the Moon is much smaller in physical size than the Sun, the Moon is much closer to us compared to the Sun. Therefore, the Moon can appear to cover the entire Sun as viewed from the Earth. Though the planets Mercury and Venus are much larger than the Moon in size, they are also much farther from the Earth as compared to the Moon. Thus, their apparent sizes are very much smaller than the Sun and they cannot block the Sun. For example, when Venus passes between the Sun and the Earth, it appears as a tiny black dot passing against the bright face of the Sun. This event, known as a Transit of Venus, is a rare event.

During a total solar eclipse, for a few minutes it turns dark during the day as no sunlight reaches the Earth. Due to the Earth’s rotation and the motion of the Moon in its orbit, the Moon’s shadow moves across the surface of the Earth. Thus, the total solar eclipse is visible only for a few minutes. As the Moon begins to move away from the front of the Sun (Fig. 12.14c), we see a partial solar eclipse and daylight begins to return. Safe Viewing of a Solar Eclipse Caution— During a solar eclipse, one might be tempted to look at the Sun, thinking that it wouldn’t be strong enough to cause harm to our eyes. However, even during the eclipse, the Sun is intense enough to damage the eyes and cause blindness. Thus, directly viewing solar eclipse must be strictly avoided. Also, do not view it through sunglasses, binoculars, or telescopes. Usually, astronomy organisations, such as planetaria and astronomy clubs hold eclipse viewing events during a solar eclipse (Fig. 12.15). Participating in such events is the best way to observe a solar eclipse since the organisers not only provide specialised eye protection for solar viewing, but also oﬀ er scientiﬁ c explanations.

A mirror can be used to project an image of the Sun onto a wall. However, holding it at the correct angle throughout a solar eclipse can be diﬃ cult. To solve this, make a movable stand for the mirror. Use a hollow ball with a small hole, half-ﬁ ll it with sand (to keep it stable), and attach a small mirror (such as an embroidery mirror) to it. Place the ball on a circular ring, like an adhesive tape ring, so it can be turned around easily. Adjust it until the Sun’s image appears on a wall or screen. Fig. 12.15 shows this set-up where the mirror is ﬁ xed to a green ball. Caution — This activity should be performed strictly under supervision of a teacher. Take care not to direct the reﬂ ected light beam in anyone’s eyes. r e e e l DIVE EEPER People have observed eclipses and maintained records since ancient times. When the reasons for eclipses were not known, they feared the occurrence of eclipses. As you can imagine, something blocking the Sun, the main source of heat and light on the Earth, even for a brief period of time, would have been extremely concerning. Many superstitions were attached to solar eclipses in various parts of the world related to the activities that could not be carried out during eclipses—such as eating, cooking, or going out of home. But now that we know the reason why a solar eclipse occurs, we need not fear these events as long as we do not look at the Sun directly. In fact, scientists go around the world to observe the eclipses from wherever these are observable. The eclipses provide them an opportunity to study phenomena that cannot be observed otherwise. FASCINATING FACTS An eclipse is known as grahan in Sanskrit and in many Indian languages. Many ancient Indian astronomical texts provide calculations to predict eclipses. The best known and most referred text is the Surya Siddhanta, which is written in the classical Sanskrit poetry tradition in rhythmic shlokas. 12.3.2 Lunar eclipse As the Moon revolves around the Earth, sometimes the Earth can block the sunlight from reaching the Moon. This is known as a lunar eclipse. On such days, we see the Earth’s shadow falling on the full disc of the Moon.
