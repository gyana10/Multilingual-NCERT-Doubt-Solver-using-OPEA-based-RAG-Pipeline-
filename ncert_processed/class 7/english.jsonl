{"class": "class 7", "subject": "english", "page_no": 3, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "FOREWORD The National Education Policy 2020 envisages a system of education in the country that is rooted in Indian ethos and its civilisational accomplishments in all domains of human endeavour and knowledge while at the same time preparing the students to constructively engage with the prospects and challenges of the 21st century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured the students’ inherent abilities touching upon all the five planes of human existence, the pañchakośhas in the Foundational and the Preparatory Stages have paved the way for the progression of their learning further at the Middle Stage. Thus, the Middle Stage acts as a bridge between the Preparatory and the Secondary Stages, spanning three years from Grade 6 to Grade 8. The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects in three languages—including at least two languages native to India—Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy—a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. Poorvi, the English language textbook for Grade 7 is one of these. Its content comprises stories, poems, and narratives that ensure a reflection of their social, cultural, and geographical landscapes wherein students are sure to find traces of their lived experiences. Poorvi also weaves into its contents"}

However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook, and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years. \b Dinesh Prasad Saklani \b Director, New Delhi\b National Council of Educational February 2025\b Research and Training"}
{"class": "class 7", "subject": "english", "page_no": 5, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "Poorvi, a textbook of English for Grade 7, is developed in alignment with the vision of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023. Language education is essential for effective communication, aesthetic expression and appreciation. Reasoning and critical thinking are very closely linked with language use, and these are valuable capacities to be developed. Language development plays an important role in the development of perceptual and practical concepts, and also enables us to check our experiences with others to ensure that we have a shared meaning emerging from these experiences. The textual material developed for the Middle Stage will take children well beyond the Preparatory Stage. Curricular Goals, competencies, and learning outcomes have been the guiding principles while developing the textbook. The Curricular Goals (CG) cover a range of competencies. The NCF-SE 2023 has stated the following Curricular Goals: CG-1: Develops independent reading, comprehension, and summarising skills of a variety of texts (stories, poems, extracts of plays, essays, articles, and news reports). CG-2: Attains the ability to write about thoughts, feelings, and experiences of social events. CG-3: Develops the capacity for effective communication using language skills for questioning, describing, analysing, and responding. CG-4: Explores different literary devices and forms of literature. CG-5: Develops the ability to recognise basic linguistic aspects (word and sentence structure) and use them in oral and written expression. CG-6: Develops an appreciation of the distinctive features of the language, including its alphabet and script, sounds, rhymes, puns, and other wordplays and games unique to the language (pp. 245–246). The Curricular Goals have been covered through a variety of themes and an array of activities. There are five thematic units that comprise stories, poems, conversation, narrative and descriptive pieces. Themes such as learning together, wit and humour, dreams and discoveries, travel and adventure and homage to bravehearts have been included. Cross-cutting themes, such as Indian Knowledge Systems, values, heritage, gender sensitivity, and inclusion have been integrated in all the units. Each unit has three literary pieces―story, poem, conversation or non-fiction. ABOUT THE BOOK"}
{"class": "class 7", "subject": "english", "page_no": 6, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "vi vi There are in-text questions, ‘Let us discuss’ to assess comprehension of the text. The end-of-the-text questions given in ‘Let us think and reflect’ are designed to encourage critical thinking, reasoning, responding, analysing, etc. Unit 1 — ‘Learning Together’ encourages students to explore the interconnectedness of nature and human life. The story, ‘The Day the River Spoke’, emphasises the importance of respecting and listening to nature. The river encourages Jahnavi to overcome her fears and societal barriers by boldly pursuing her desire for education, assuring that her courage can make a difference. The poem, ‘Try Again’ inspires resilience and the power of perseverance, encouraging students to view challenges as stepping stones to success. The poem leaves a powerful impact on the readers, inspiring them to achieve their best goal in life. ‘Three Days to See’ presents a touching narrative of a girl who cannot see and that invites learners to appreciate their senses and value the beauty of the world around them. Unit 2 — ‘Wit and Humour’ engages students with a light-hearted story, poem, and play. These delightful works showcase the charm of intelligence, humour and laughter. The amusing tale of ‘Animals, Birds, and Dr. Dolittle’ will help students explore the idea of a doctor who learns animal language. He not only communicates with animals but also treats their ailments with empathy. The story is a fable that entertains and also educates about animal care. The poem, ‘A Funny Man’ celebrates humour which can be unfamiliar that can spark curiosity and amusement. ‘Say the Right Thing’ highlights the comic consequences of miscommunication. The play focuses on the fact that it is important to say the right thing at the right time. We must listen carefully to what others are saying and we must think before we speak. Unit 3 — ‘Dreams and Discoveries’ captures the essence of wonder and imagination of children. It also sparks curiosity and creativity, encouraging students to explore how dreams and discoveries shape the world. ‘My Brother’s Great Invention’ is a humorous story about a boy who likes to discover new things around him. This leads to an unexpected encounter with a thief. The story highlights determination, creativity, and sibling bonds, teaching students the value of trial and error in discovery. The poem ‘Paper Boats’ uses the imagery of paper boats to symbolise dreams and aspirations. Students will reflect on the joy of simple pleasures and the universal desire to connect with the unknown. ‘North, South, East, West’ will help students appreciate the diversity that exists in our country. The narrative presents postcards from a girl exploring India’s diverse landscapes with her parents. The vibrant observations will foster an appreciation for the country’s rich cultural and natural heritage."}
{"class": "class 7", "subject": "english", "page_no": 7, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "vii Unit 4 — ‘Travel and Adventure’ ignites the spirit of exploration and aims to cultivate curiosity, resilience, and a sense of wonder. The story, ‘The Tunnel’ will take students on an adventurous episode in a tunnel, highlighting the excitement of discovery and the courage to face the unknown. It also conveys the concept of maturing through self-exploration. The poem, ‘Travel’ revolves around the theme of exploring the unknown and a strong desire to travel. Train is used as a symbol to embark on to new adventures with new people. The sun’s journey is used as a metaphor for constant movement and the human urge for exploration. ‘Conquering the Summit’ is a non-fiction piece on Arunima Sinha, the first female amputee to scale Mount Everest to accomplish her dream. This will inspire students with her extraordinary determination and perseverance. Unit 5 — ‘Bravehearts’ instills a sense of patriotism and gratitude in students, celebrating the courage and sacrifices of the valiant who have selflessly laid down their lives for the nation. ‘A Homage to Our Brave Soldiers’ is a tribute to the real heroes of our nation—our soldiers, the embodiment of patriotism. The poem ‘My Dear Soldiers’ is a heartfelt acknowledgement of the courage, dedication, and sacrifice of the soldiers who tirelessly defend the nation, often in harsh and unforgiving conditions. The graphic story of ‘Rani Abbakka’ is a tale of a fearless queen, who defied Portuguese colonial powers with resilience and military acumen. She exhibited indomitable courage, valour, and determination. These literary pieces serve not only as sources of entertainment but also as repositories of valuable life lessons, fostering personal growth and equipping children with skills to navigate social situations with confidence. By resonating with children’s daily experiences, the selected pieces promote positive values such as resilience, empathy, and emotional intelligence, thereby exerting a profound impact on their overall development. The primary focus lies in cultivating competencies in listening, speaking, reading, and writing while concurrently developing vocabulary and grammar in context. Language learning truly comes to life when connected to the immediate environment of learners, allowing them to express their thoughts, feelings, and experiences through experiential learning. All the activities are conveniently colour coded under headings such as―‘Let us discuss’, ‘Let us think and reflect’, ‘Let us speak’, ‘Let us listen’, ‘Let us learn’, ‘Let us write’ and ‘Let us explore’. ‘Let us Explore’ extends learning beyond the text, staying within the unit’s theme. It aims to connect students with the Indian Knowledge System, fostering an appreciation for our rich heritage and culture, encouraging students to delve deeper, engage in"}

Poorvi The textbook of English for Grade 7 is titled Poorvi after the Indian rāga ‘Poorvi’. This rāga is said to promote harmony and serenity. It is associated with dusk, specifically sunset time (Sandhi Prakash). Each rāga in Indian music carries its own emotional significance and is symbolically connected to certain seasons, times of day, and moods. Rāgas are believed to evoke specific emotions in listeners. Poorvi is an ancient and traditional Hindustani classical rāga that originated in eastern India. It is typically performed during the fourth prahar of the day, between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. It evokes a sense of calmness and contemplation in the journey of learners, symbolising a harmonious blend of traditional and modern learning."}

And a green lizard slithered down to the river’s edge to bask in the sun. “Dear, dear!” said a sleepy, murmuring voice, “What’s the matter?” Jahnavi was startled, because she was sure she had been quite alone. It couldn’t have been the lizard. And the kingfisher was up in the thicket of bamboo eating the fish it had caught. It couldn’t be the parrots, because parrots shrieked and this was such a sleepy voice. She looked around her. There wasn’t a soul in sight.

Ettan means ‘Elder brother’, but his real name was Gopi. “I want to know why spiders are yellow in yellow flowers, why bamboo trees rustle, why the moon always comes from behind the hills, never the other way, why the baby fish in the field water become frogs, why...” “Stop!” said the River. “You make me breathless.

You just slip along one morning and sit there in the school and listen to what’s going on, and maybe the teacher will let you stay.” “I couldn’t,” gasped Jahnavi. “I couldn’t! They’d scare me!

Scared?” the River said, “when you’re not afraid of the green lizard, or of the snake in the bamboo clump, (Jahnavi startled) or the big trains rattling past that bridge.” “Trains are noisy; I prefer ships,” said the River. Jahnavi never knew the snake lived in the bamboo clump. “What are ships?” she asked. “Big boats,” said the River, “so big that they can take hundreds of people, and they sail along the sea with lights that shine all night.” Jahnavi held her breath. “Will they come here?” she asked. “I’m afraid not,” said the River. “Too large, you know.

It was a story about a prince called Asˊ hoka, who became a great king. Little Appu had fallen asleep on her shoulder. She crept nearer and nearer till she was in the back row, squatting with the others on the earthen floor. Little Appu made no noise and she listened. “Where did you spring from, little girl?” asked the teacher. “And what is your name? You’re new in my class.” “She’s Gopi’s sister, Gopi is in the next class,” said one of the boys. “It’s Jahnavi,” said another. “So, you’re Gopi’s little sister? Nice lad, Gopi.” “If you really, really want to come to my school, Jahnavi,” the teacher had said, “we’ll talk to your father about it. Don’t you worry. We’ll find a way.” Jahnavi saw the teacher walking up the steps to their gate the next evening when she was lighting the lamp. She could see her father scratching his cheek the way he did when he was worried and the teacher was nodding and saying something she couldn’t make out. And Mother said, “Little Jahnavi, I shall miss you when you go to school. Girls should learn as much as they want.

Try Again Let us listen (refer to page 24) 1. You will listen to a story about an ant. Read the questions given below and before you listen, guess the answers to these questions. Hello everyone, I’m sure you have enjoyed learning about King Bruce and the spider. Let me share another story with you. In a thick green forest, there lived a little ant. She was known for her determination and never-give-up attitude. One sunny day, the ant found a delicious piece of roti that was too big for her to carry alone. “This crumb is huge, but I must get it back to the anthill. My family will be so happy!” she thought to herself. She tried to lift the crumb with all her might, but it was too heavy. She tried pushing it, pulling it and even rolling it, but nothing seemed to work. Exhausted and saddened, she sat down and began to cry. As the ant sat there, feeling beaten, she noticed a small bird nearby. The bird was trying to build a nest. It picked up twigs and leaves, but every time it tried to place them, the wind would blow them away. However, the bird did not give up. It kept trying, over and over again, until finally, it managed to build a strong nest. Poorvi 40"}

Determined once more, the ant gathered all her strength and decided to try again. She called her fellow ants for help. Together, they formed a chain and lifted the crumb with their combined strength. Slowly but surely, they carried the crumb back to the anthill. “We did it! Thank you, everyone! We showed that with teamwork and never giving up, we can achieve anything!” the ant shouted, excited and grateful. She and her friends celebrated their success. We too should learn this lesson from the ant’s experience—never give up, no matter how difficult the situation may seem. Hope you all liked the story. Thank you! 2.

What is a screen reader, Ma? Mother : I knew you’d ask about it! Well, a screen reader is a software application that helps people who are visually impaired use computers and smartphones. It reads out the text displayed on the screen and provides audio feedback. Anuj : That’s amazing! So, Tara can use a computer just like we do? Mother : Yes, she can. Anuj : So, it makes a big difference in their daily lives. Mother : It certainly does. It ensures that people who are visually impaired can use digital services independently, without help from others. This can improve their quality of life. It also opens up more job opportunities in fields like IT, banking, and more, where they can work just efficiently like anybody else. Anuj : Wow!

The parrot, Polynesia, was sitting in the window looking out at the rain and singing a sailor song to herself. She stopped singing and started to listen. “You see, Doctor,” the Cat’s-food-Man went on, “you know all about animals—much more than what these vets here do.

Be an animal doctor. Give the silly people up—if they haven’t brains enough to see you’re the best doctor in the world. Take care of animals instead— they’ll soon find it out.

At teatime, when the dog, Jip, came in, the parrot said to the Doctor, “See, he’s talking to you.” “Looks to me as though he were scratching his ear,” said the Doctor. “But animals don’t always speak with their mouths,” said the parrot in a high voice, raising her eyebrows. “They talk with their ears, with their feet, with their tails—with everything.

Ma rushed in to see what the racket was all about and found Papa standing there, sopping wet and scowling. “I want to know who is behind this nonsense,” Papa said grimly. “I think it’s supposed to be a burglar alarm,” Ma said, in a soothing voice. “I don’t care what it’s supposed to be,” Papa said. “Where’s that boy? I’m sure he rigged this up.” Anand had vanished by this time and reappeared only after dinner when Papa had cooled down. Before this story, let me put you in the picture. I am Anita, fourteen years old. My brother Anand, one year younger than me, caused all that hoo-ha with his burglar alarm. And this is not the first time he’s got on Papa’s nerves or frightened someone half to death in the house. The trouble with him is that he thinks he is a scientist. He loves tinkering with all sorts of electrical gadgets, tools, dynamos, planks of wood, and things like that. And he keeps creating ‘inventions’ that never work out as they are supposed to. Recently there had been a rush of thefts in the colony and Anand had got it into his head that what was needed was a burglar alarm. So, the minute Papa left for the office and Ma for the market, he started on his latest scheme. As usual I had to be involved, though I’d have preferred to finish my novel. “If you get a shelling, don’t bring me in,” I warned Anand. “Nothing will go wrong this time. I’ve planned it out carefully. See the blueprint.” racket: a loud and disturbing noise scowling: having an angry or frowning expression rigged up: assembled something temporarily tinkering: experimenting or fiddling dynamos: electric generator sopping: soaking"}

Papa, who always opens the door softly, was thoroughly soaked and angry as angry could be. Anyway, for a week after this, Anand did not dare try out anything new. Then we saw this film ‘Back to the Future’. I don’t know if you have seen it, but it’s all about a time machine. Well, that was stealthily: quietly or carefully so that one is not seen or heard sceptical: doubtful smugly: proudly clanging: a loud ringing sound like that of a metal being hit elaborate: detailed Anand loves words like blueprint—it makes him feel professional! Anyway, I looked at the elaborate drawing of doors, wires, and bells and asked, “How does this thing work?” “It’s quite simple. The moment the door opens, this alarm is tripped off and makes a clanging sound. Then this water bag here is loosened and falls on the thief’s head. By then we call the police—simple!” “But how does the alarm know that a burglar is opening the door?” “I’ve taken care of that,” Anand said loftily. I had the end of peace and quiet in the house. My brother decided that he had to make a time machine too. Papa locked up his tool box and hid the key while Ma kept a wary eye on her oven and mixer. Because, as I told you, when Anand is on one of his inventing binges, he takes apart all the gadgets in the house to collect parts. You can’t imagine the noise that Dreams and Discoveries"}

Finally, after a fortnight of frantic activity, the time machine was ready. “We can try it out tonight,” Anand announced to everyone at home at lunch time. “I don’t know what you’ve been up to in that room, but you’re not trying out anything new,” Papa said firmly. “But it’s a time machine! I’ve invented it,” Anand protested. “When I say NO, I mean NO,” Papa said, glaring. “Poor boy,” Ma said noticing Anand’s crestfallen look. “At least let’s take a look at it.” Papa sighed. “All right, but if the house falls, it’s your fault.” As it turned out, we could not try out the time machine that day at all. The next day, Papa and Ma were going to Kharagpur, a few hours away from Calcutta (now Kolkata), for a wedding. Ma was worried about leaving us alone, but we reassured her. “We’re old enough to look after ourselves, Ma,” I said. “And we can go next door to Sharma Aunty if we need anything.” “And it’s only one night,” Anand added. “All right.

I shook Anand and whispered, “Listen, there’s someone at the door.” “Go and open it then,” he muttered groggily. “You silly! Someone’s trying to get in,” I said. Anand sat up. “Who? What?” “I don’t know,” I said. “What shall we do?” “Let’s holler for help,” he said. Before we could do anything, the door swung open and we found ourselves looking at a ruffianly fellow with a green scarf around his neck. Anand gasped. “Hey, it’s Boppa!” I whispered. It was indeed the fellow who had recently begun sweeping out the compounds in our row of houses. So, he was the thief, and no wonder. He knew exactly when the occupants were out, leaving the coast clear. The fellow gave an evil grin. “One squeak out of you and see what happens,” he said, brandishing his cudgel and backing out of the room.

More strange noises emerged from the next room—a few muffled thumps, an eerie whine, and a low, humming sound. “My time machine, he’s started it!” Anand gasped. “I wish we could get out of this room and see what is happening out there.” There was another howl, much fainter this time, and a great deal of clattering. We shouted for all we were worth. In a few minutes, we heard footsteps running up our drive.

Amma and Appa are fast asleep. (When the subject of a sentence has two or more nouns or pronouns that are connected by ‘and’, we use a plural verb). 2. It’s hot, dry, and there is sand everywhere. (In case the subject is ‘it’, the verb that follows is either ‘is’ or ‘was’ depending on the tense of the sentence). 3. There are so many hills here, and beaches too. (When we begin a sentence with ‘there’, the subject comes after the verb). The subject of a sentence is closely linked to the verb. The verb form changes depending on whether the subject is singular or plural and if it is in the third person. Choosing the correct verb based on the subject is called subject-verb agreement. Let us understand subject-verb agreement better. • A subject and its verb must agree, even if other words or phrases come between them. The formation of paragraphs is important in writing. • When the subjects are considered individually, we use a singular verb. Every man and woman has the right to vote. • Collective nouns such as ‘class’, ‘committee’, ‘audience’, ‘team’ can be singular or plural, based on the context of the sentence. If the sentence implies the group is acting as one unit, the noun is singular and takes a singular verb. The committee decides on the new policy tomorrow. • The indefinite pronouns ‘each’, ‘either’, ‘every’, ‘much’, and ‘neither’ always require singular verbs. Each of the children was given a gift. • Subjects that look plural because they end in ‘s’ but refer to one thing are singular. Mathematics is an interesting subject. • Some nouns (like glasses, scissors, pants, and tongs) are plural but take a singular verb when the phrase ‘pair of’ is placed before it. Here, ‘pair’ is the subject. This pair of scissors is sharp. 130 Poorvi"}

As you listen, choose the correct option for the questions given below. Hi everyone, We all know that Agartala is the capital of Tripura. But did you know how Agartala got its name? It’s made up of two words: ‘agar’, which is a type of tree, and ‘tala’, meaning underneath. So, Agartala means ‘under the agar tree’. These trees are also called aloeswood, eaglewood, or gharuwood. It is also referred to as ‘wood of the gods’. Agarwood, the wood from these trees, is really special. It smells amazing—like a mix of woody and flowery scents. It is one of the rarest and the most expensive woods in the world. People have used it for thousands of years in medicines, perfumes and rituals. It has been described as early as 1400 BCE in the Vedas. The Egyptians are believed to have used agarwood incense as part of their rituals more than 3,000 years ago. Here’s something even more remarkable—agarwood only forms when the tree is hurt or infected with a bug or virus. Instead of dying, the tree creates this dark, sticky, sweet-smelling substance called agar oil which protects it from further infection. Agarwood is very important to people in Agartala. It’s used to make perfumes, incense, and the hand carvings which Tripura is famous for. And here’s the best part: the tree was once almost extinct, but now, thanks to people taking care of it, you can find it in almost every house in northern Tripura. How great is that! 138 Poorvi"}

The railway lines were two straight black serpents disappearing into the tunnel in the hillside. Suraj stood near the cutting, waiting for the midday train. It wasn’t a station, and he wasn’t catching a train. He was waiting so that he could watch the steam engine come roaring out of the tunnel. He had cycled out of the town and taken the jungle path until he had come to a small village. He had left the cycle there, and walked over a low scrub-covered hill and down to the tunnel exit.

A second or two later, the steam engine shot out of the tunnel, snorting and puffing like some green, black, and gold dragon, some beautiful monster out of Suraj’s dreams. Showering sparks left and right, it roared a challenge to the jungle. Instinctively, Suraj stepped back a few paces. Waves of hot steam struck him in the face. Even the trees seemed to flinch from the noise and heat. And then the train had gone, leaving only a plume of smoke to drift lazily over the tall shisham trees. The jungle was still again. No one moved. Suraj turned from his contemplation of the drifting smoke and began walking along the embankment towards the tunnel. The tunnel grew darker as he walked further into it. When he had gone about twenty yards, it became pitch dark. Suraj had to turn and look back at the opening to reassure himself that there was still daylight outside.

If something was wrong, he would walk back up the line and wave a red flag, and the engine driver would slow down. At night, the watchman lit an oil lamp and made a similar inspection of the tunnel. Of course, he would not stop the train if there was a porcupine on the line. But if there was any danger to the train, he’d go back up the line and wave his lamp to the approaching engine. If all was well, he’d hang his lamp at the door of his hut and go to sleep. He was just settling down on his cot for an afternoon nap when he saw the boy emerge from the tunnel.

Sunder Singh was waiting for Suraj. He had watered his small garden, and the flowers looked cool and fresh.

Sunder Singh lit his oil lamp and said it was time for him to inspect the tunnel. He moved off towards the tunnel, while Suraj sat on the cot, sipping his tea. In the dark, the trees seemed to move closer to him. And the nightlife of the forest was conveyed on the breeze—the sharp call of a barking deer, the cry of a fox, the quaint tonk-tonk of a nightjar. There were some sounds that Suraj didn’t recognise—sounds that came from the trees, creakings and whisperings, as though the trees were coming to life, stretching their limbs in the dark, shifting a little, flexing their fingers. Sunder Singh stood inside the tunnel, trimming his lamp. The night sounds were familiar to him and he did not give them much thought; but something else—a padded footfall, a rustle of dry leaves—made him stand still for a few seconds, peering into the darkness. Then, humming softly to himself, he returned to where Suraj was waiting. Ten minutes remained for the night mail to arrive. As Sunder Singh sat down on the cot beside Suraj, a new sound reached both of them quite distinctly—a rhythmic sawing sound, as if someone cutting through the branch of a tree. “What’s that?” whispered Suraj. “It’s the leopard,” said Sunder Singh. “I think it’s in the tunnel.” “The train will soon be here,” said Suraj. “Yes, my friend. And if we don’t drive the leopard out of the tunnel, it will be run over and killed. I can’t let that happen.” “But won’t it attack us if we try to drive it out?” asked Suraj, beginning to share the watchman’s concern. “Not this leopard. It knows me well. We have seen each other many times. It has a weakness for goats and stray dogs, but it will not harm us. Even so, I’ll take my axe with me. You stay here, Suraj.” “No, I’m coming with you.

It was crouching between the tracks, only five metres away from them. It was not a very big leopard, but it looked lithe and sinewy. Baring its teeth and snarling, it went down on its belly, tail twitching. Suraj and Sunder Singh both shouted together. Their voices rang through the tunnel. And the leopard, uncertain as to how many terrifying humans were there in the tunnel with him, turned swiftly and disappeared into the darkness. To make sure that it had gone, Sunder Singh and Suraj walked the length of the tunnel. When they returned to the entrance, the rails were beginning to hum. They knew the train was coming.

And when it had gone, the silence returned and the forest flickering: burning unsteadily fringe: edge shrill: sharp sound seemed to breathe, to live again. Only the rails still trembled with the passing of the train. They trembled again to the passing of the same train, almost a week later, when Suraj and his father were both travelling in it. Suraj’s father was scribbling in a notebook, doing his accounts. Suraj sat at an open window staring out at the darkness. His father was going to Delhi on a business trip and had decided to take the boy along. (“I don’t know where he gets to, most of the time,” he’d complained. “I think it’s time he learnt something about my business.”) The night mail rushed through the forest with its hundreds of passengers. The carriage wheels beat out a steady rhythm on the rails. Tiny flickering lights came and went, as they passed small villages on the fringe of the jungle. Suraj heard the rumble as the train passed over a small bridge. It was too dark to see the hut near the cutting, but he knew they must be approaching the tunnel. He strained his eyes looking out into the night; and then, just as the engine let out a shrill whistle, Suraj saw the lamp. He couldn’t see Sunder Singh, but he saw the lamp, and he knew that his friend was out there. The train went into the tunnel and out again; it left the jungle behind and thundered across the endless plains. Suraj stared out at the darkness, thinking of the lonely cutting in the forest and the watchman with the lamp, who would always remain a firefly for those travelling thousands as he lit up the darkness for steam engines and leopards.

Let us speak When speaking in English, small differences in pronunciation can change the overall meaning of the words. One such difference is in the pronunciation of the consonant ‘c’. For example: cat (uses /k/ sound for ‘c’) and city (uses the /s/ sound for ‘c’) The poem uses the word ‘cinders’, which is pronounced with a /s/ sound. The letter ‘c’ has two sounds. It can be pronounced as a /k/ or /s/ sound. But which is right depends on the next letters of the words. • Letter ‘c’ produces /s/ sound if it is followed by the letters ‘e’, ‘i’, or ‘y’. For example, city (‘c’ is followed by ‘i’). This /s/ sound is known as the soft ‘c’ sound. • Letter ‘c’ produces /k/ sound if it is followed by the letters ‘a’, ‘o’, or ‘u’ or a consonant at the end of the word. For example, cat (‘c’ is followed by ‘a’). This /k/ sound is known as the hard ‘c’ sound. That is why ‘cinders’ is pronounced with a /s/ sound. The letter ‘c’ is followed by ‘i’! Now, work in pairs.

These three railways are the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, the Nilgiri Mountain Railway, and the Kalka–Shimla Railway. The Matheran Hill Railway and Kangra Valley Railway are on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. They are still fully operational as living examples of the ingenious engineering enterprise of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The owner of the three properties is the Railway Ministry of the Indian Government. In groups of four, find out more about these heritage trains and make a presentation in the class. II As an excellent example of the ‘Make in India’ success story, the Indian Railways launched India’s first indigenous semi-high-speed train, Vande Bharat Express. It has become a symbol of India’s aspirations for modern, efficient, and comfortable rail travel. The first Vande Bharat Express train was flagged off on 15 February 2019, on the New Delhi– Kanpur–Allahabad–Varanasi route, running at a speed of 160 kilometres per hour. Courtesy PIB.

Arunima Sinha’s journey from a devastating accident to scaling the highest peak in the world stands as a beacon of hope and resilience. In 2011, at the age of 24, Arunima Sinha, a national-level volleyball player, faced a life-altering event. It challenged her in ways she could never have imagined. As she lay in the hospital bed with one leg amputated, Arunima made a vow that many would deem impossible: not only to walk again with a prosthetic leg but to scale Mount Everest. In 2013, she did just that, becoming the first Indian female amputee to achieve this feat. Hence, in 2015, she was awarded the Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award in India. She was also awarded the Tenzing Norgay National Adventure Award and Courtesy: Hindustan Times beacon: source of inspiration resilience: ability to recover quickly from a difficulty amputated: cut off a part of the body (here the leg) prosthetic leg: an artificial leg that helps people to move around easily feat: achievement harrowing: extremely disturbing and painful rigorous: severe National Award for Best Female Mountaineer. Arunima hails from Ambedkar Nagar, a small district in Uttar Pradesh. Her father was an army engineer, and her mother worked as a health supervisor. Sports were a significant part of Arunima’s life, with her family having a natural inclination towards athletics. After completing her law degree following her post-graduation, Arunima decided to pursue a job in the paramilitary forces, which would allow her to continue her passion for sports while having a regular income. On the fateful night of 11 April 2011, she met with a train accident. The hours that followed were harrowing. She never imagined she would survive that night, but survive she did, miraculously, displaying an extraordinary will to live. Arunima received a prosthetic leg and underwent physiotherapy. It was during this period that she made a profound decision. Inspired by an article about Mount Everest, she resolved to conquer the highest peak in the world. To pursue her ambition, Arunima Sinha completed a basic mountaineering course at the Nehru Institute of Mountaineering in Uttarkashi, followed by eighteen months of rigorous training.

Do you remember our last conversation about war and the importance of peace? We talked about how India had to struggle for its Independence from the British for many centuries. Post-independence our country has had to fight several wars to protect its borders, territorial integrity, and its people. This made me wonder, who were these brave Indian people? They fought to protect our country and sacrificed their lives so that we could lead our lives in peace. What were their names? Where did they come from? Does anyone remember anything about them? Last week I got the answers to some of my questions during an educational trip to New Delhi organised by our school. You may recall, I was looking forward to this trip and our visit to many places of historical and educational significance. I learnt several new and interesting things, and I am excited to share them with you. Let me begin by asking you to guess the name of the monument that I found most inspiring. Let’s see if you can guess. The construction of this monument started in April 2018 and was completed in February 2019. It was envisioned and then inaugurated by India’s Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi territorial integrity: safeguarding nation’s borders envisioned: visualised"}

In terms of location and size, it is spread over 40 acres of land near the iconic India Gate. But more importantly, it is a tribute to some of the bravest Indians. I’m sure you’ve guessed! It’s the ‘National War Memorial’. Won’t you say, a long-desired aspiration was fulfilled? Our visit to the National War Memorial began with our teacher explaining that even after Independence, India has had to fight many wars to protect herself, and the freedom and security we enjoy today is because of the many brave men and women who have served in the Indian Armed Forces over decades. Sadly, she said, war always takes its toll, and therefore, many brave soldiers have had to sacrifice their lives for the country even after our Independence in 1947. This is what makes monuments like the National War Memorial extremely important, so that we should never forget the cost of freedom. We are aware, always, of the pain and horrors of war. We learnt that each brick of the memorial is called a tablet, and it bears the names of soldiers who fought for India and made the supreme sacrifice in different wars from 1947 till date, including the Indo-China conflict of 1962, the Indo- Pak Wars in 1965 & 1971 and the Kargil War in 1999. There are 29,000 tablets on which more than 26,000 names of fallen soldiers have been etched. It was heartening to know that our government has recognised the sacrifice of brave soldiers. Our teacher told us about the 21 bravehearts who were awarded the Param Vir Chakra (PVC), India’s highest wartime gallantry medal, for their service to the nation. She also told us about Maha Vir Chakra (MVC), Kirti Chakra (KC), Vir Chakra (VrC), and Shaurya Chakra (SC). Major Somnath Sharma was posthumously awarded India’s first PVC in the Battle of Badgam in 1947. Later some more PVCs were awarded for exceptional gallantry during the India- China Conflict of 1962, and the India-Pakistan War of 1965. Besides, a PVC was also awarded for service during the UN Peace Keeping Operations in Congo. In the 1971 war, some of the heroes who were awarded the PVC (posthumously) include Lance Naik Albert Ekka, Flying Officer Nirmal Jit Singh Sekhon, Second Lieutenant Arun Khetarpal, and Major Hoshiar Singh.

Here is a picture of the new Amar Jawan Jyoti if you haven’t seen it. You can see the obelisk surrounded by wreaths that have been placed as a mark of respect. The lighting design is planned in such a way that it transforms the monument’s landscape as sunlight changes from dawn to dusk. It truly is a majestic site that filled me with pride for our nation.

I felt as if I had developed a bond with the place. I learnt a lot, but I also have to admit that the various discourses during the day brought tears to my eyes. It was sad to think about the massive devastation and loss of life caused by wars. It motivated me to live a life worthy of the sacrifices of our heroes. After our visit, the class decided to make presentations on stories of valour of the bravehearts we came across at the National War Memorial. We divided ourselves into five groups. We decided to make presentations depicting the courageous stories of the soldiers. Our teacher has also advised us to share our experience during the school assembly. I am delighted that all the students of our school will get to know about the National War Memorial and the soldiers it commemorates.

Success of the battalion and brigade operation hinged on the early capture of this position. However, the company attack almost faltered at the very beginning when the enemy’s artillery fire came down squarely on the leading platoon, inflicting large number of casualties. With utter disregard to his personal safety, Major Padmapani Acharya took the reserve platoon of his company and led it through raining artillery shells. Even as his men were falling to the murderous enemy fire, he continued to encourage his men and charged at the enemy up the steep rock face with his reserve platoon. Unmindful of the hail of bullets from the enemy’s position, Major Padmapani Acharya crawled up to the enemy position and lobbed grenades. In this daring assault, Major Acharya was severely injured. Despite being seriously injured and unable to move, he ordered his men to leave him and charge at the enemy while he continued to fire at the enemy. The enemy position was finally over-run and the objective was captured. After completion of the mission, the officer however, succumbed to his injuries. Major Padmapani Acharya displayed exceptional courage, leadership and spirit of self-sacrifice in the face of the enemy. https://www.gallantryawards.gov.in/awards The citation for the Maha Vir Chakra reads as follows:"}

I enjoyed reading your experience of the visit to the National War Memorial in Delhi, as well as your observations and feelings during the visit. You really have an eye for detail, and being the sensitive person that you are, you have been able to capture the essence of the emotions associated with this memorial. I was happy to hear that you got an opportunity to visit the National War Memorial. I have heard a lot about it. Some people might see a war memorial as just a monument, statue, an edifice to celebrate our war heroes or victory and commemorate those who lost their lives or got injured in the war. In my view, it is also an expression of deep gratitude for the supreme sacrifice made by our brave soldiers defending the sovereignty and integrity of the country. I feel motivated and I am seriously thinking of joining the Armed Forces to serve my motherland. I also feel it is our duty to periodically visit such places to honour our valiant soldiers, who have made great sacrifices for us. Their sacrifices enable us to walk freely in our country without fear of enemy threats. It is nice of your teacher and school to arrange this visit to give you all a chance to learn about India’s heroes and also pay your respect to them. The idea of your class to make a presentation at the school and make everyone a part of your experience is wonderful! Best of edifice: a large building which is impressive valiant: very brave"}

Your letter has reminded me of a time when we visited the war memorial in our city. While visiting one of Chandigarh’s gardens, we saw a lot of activity around the Bougainvillea Garden in Sector 3. As we approached the garden, we saw people offering flowers and prayers. We joined the group out of curiosity and quickly realised that they were all there to pay respect to the soldiers at the War Memorial located in the heart of the garden. When I think back about my visit where everyone was dedicating flowers as a mark of respect to our soldiers, I was reminded of the following poem: Pushp ki Abhilasha Chaah Nahi, Main Sur Bala Ke Gehanon Mein Goontha Jaaun, Chaah Nahi, Premi-Mala Mein Bandh Pyaari Ko Lalchaaun!

I must say, I was inspired by your idea of presenting the valourous stories of India’s soldiers. There are so many stories of courage, bravery and sacrifice which remind us that many of the challenges we face in our lives are inconsequential. We can enjoy peace in our country and the luxury of exchanging ideas with our friends because our Armed Forces are alert and work hard to create that environment for us. Very recently, I read in the newspaper that Captain Anuj Nayyar, MVC, an Indian Army officer of the 17 Jat regiment was posthumously awarded the Maha Vir Chakra, India’s second highest gallantry award, for exemplary valour during the Kargil War in 1999. I look forward to learning more about him. Meanwhile, I learnt that his mother Meena Nayyar has written a memoir titled Tiger of Drass– Capt. Anuj Nayyar – 23 – Kargil Hero, which I shall certainly go through. I am sharing with you an excerpt of her interview with IANS. Captain Anuj Nayyar, MahaVir Chakra “Writing about the smallest things about your child who is not with you really used to shake me, but gradually I came to terms with it by telling myself that if I didn’t write about him no one would know about Anuj’s sacrifice.” Published on: 13 April 2022, 1:59 p.m. I have shared your experience with many of my friends.

As you listen, answer the questions given below in two–three exact words you hear. Good morning, respected teachers and my dear friends. Today, I, Gunjan, of Grade 7-C, stand before you to share why I dream of joining the Indian Armed Forces when I grow up. Serving our country is the most honourable job one can have. It means protecting and securing our nation, even if it means risking one’s life. The thought of wearing the uniform, which can only be earned through hard work, fills me with pride and a strong desire to serve India. The Armed Forces teach you to live a disciplined and organised life. This keeps both the mind and body active. Soldiers are always ready to face challenges because of this discipline. Additionally, regular exercise and training keep soldiers physically fit and ready for any situation. This preparation is something I greatly admire and wish to achieve. Lastly, being a soldier means having new experiences and adventures everyday. Each day brings new challenges, teaching important lessons, and helping one grow. The Armed Forces offer a life filled with honour, self-respect, safety, and security for both the soldier and their families. It is a life that teaches loyalty, duty, service, and honesty. This is why I want to join the Indian Armed Forces. Thank you. 223 Bravehearts"}

Hello children, you all have read about Rani Abbakka. Let me share with you some details about one more braveheart. Her name is Rani Gaidinliu. Gaidinliu was born on 26 January 1915, in the present-day Tamenglong district of Manipur. She was a Naga leader who led an armed uprising against the British in Manipur, Nagaland, and Assam. Gaidinliu belonged to the Rongmei tribe, also known as the Kabui tribe. 224 Poorvi"}
{"class": "class 7", "subject": "english", "page_no": 239, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "In 1927, at the age of 13, Gaidinliu joined the Heraka movement. This movement aimed at the revival of the Naga tribal religion and the establishment of self-rule for the Nagas, ending British rule. Gaidinliu was arrested in 1932 when she was just 16 and was sentenced to life imprisonment by the British rulers. Between 1932 and 1947, she was kept in several prisons across the Northeast. After being released in 1947, she continued to work for the betterment of her community. The then Prime Minister described Gaidinliu as the ‘Daughter of the Hills’ and gave her the title ‘Rani’ for her courage. She was also awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1982. In 1991, Rani Gaidinliu returned to her birthplace, where she died on 17 February 1993 at the age of 78. Rani Gaidinliu was conferred the Birsa Munda Award posthumously. The State Government has developed a park along with a statue to honour Rani Gaidinliu in Silchar, Assam. Not only that, the Government of India issued a postal stamp in her honour in 1996 and a commemorative coin in 2015.
