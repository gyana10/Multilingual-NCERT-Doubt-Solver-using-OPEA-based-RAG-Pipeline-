The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured the students’ inherent abilities touching upon all the five planes of human existence, the pañchakośhas in the Foundational and the Preparatory Stages have paved the way for the progression of their learning further at the Middle Stage. Thus, the Middle Stage acts as a bridge between the Preparatory and the Secondary Stages, spanning three years from Grade 6 to Grade 8. The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages — including at least two languages native to India — to Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different Foreword"}

Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. The book for Physical education and well-being, titled Khel Yatra for Grade 7, is meticulously designed to develop motor skills and engage children in the team sports of Badminton, Football and Kabaddi. Age-specific aspects of Yoga are designed to lay the foundation for healthy living. The textbook aligns with the competencies included in the NCF-SE 2023 for this stage. Khel Yatra emphasises the importance of physical activity and the values and dispositions essential for life. It incorporates cross-cutting themes, such as inclusion, gender equality, and cultural rootedness. The content and activities are designed to encourage peer group learning, and enrich the educational experience for both students and teachers. While this textbook is valuable, children should also explore interesting local games and play with friends. This book is not only useful for school learning, but is a valuable resource for parents and community. However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so."}

Considering the focus on holistic well-being, NCF-SE has mandated Physical Education and Well-being as a core curricular area for all stages of school education. To help the teachers and students achieve curricular goals of Physical Education and Well-being, for the first time a textbook has been designed for Grade 7. This book enables students to experience the joy of playing, explore diverse physical activities, practice fitness skills, learn basic sports skills, and immerse in the world of yoga. Sports and physical activities teach important motor skills, socio-emotional awareness and regulation, associated cognitive abilities, as well as the values of self-discipline, hard work, teamwork, and a gracious acceptance of one’s strengths and vulnerabilities. To achieve the goals of fitness, sports and holistic well-being, the Grade 7 textbook is designed to have five units. 1. Foundational Basis of Physical Education and Well-being 2. Physical Motor Fitness 3. Fundamental Skills of Badminton 4. Fundamental Skills of Football 5. Fundamental Skills of Kabaddi 6.

Through playing games and engaging in discussions, students will understand the importance of living a healthy lifestyle and how physical activity adds to their overall enjoyment and success. Students will also learn about the safety measures to minimize the risk of injuries and create a healthy environment for the students. In Unit 2, students learn different fitness components like endurance, strength, flexibility, and balance. The main aim is to understand how each of these components contributes to overall health. In the Units 3, 4 and 5 focus is on learning new games. Badminton is introduced in Unit 3, Football in Unit 4 and Kabaddi in Unit 5. Through interactive sessions and group exercises, students will discover the excitement of sport and health advantages of physical activity. The emphasis will be on inclusivity, team cohesion, and enjoyment of movement. In the last unit, students immerse in the holistic nature of yoga. They learn about Yama (social discipline) and Niyama (Personal discipline) to inculcate healthy habits for positive behavior. Systematic practice of various yogasanas starting with Sūkshma Vyāyāma (loosening exercises), preparatory breathing practices and step-by-step performance of each asana helps our body to be flexible, strong, balanced and disease free. Various techniques of Prānāyāma strengthen the lungs, improves functioning of major systems of our body, calm down the mind, improve concentration and help in achieving overall harmony and well-being. To explore the world within us and experience deep sense of peace, tranquility and bliss, students learn different techniques of Dhārana (single pointed concentration) and Dhyāna (meditation). Learning various yogic practices lays foundation for long and healthy life.

Structure and Flow of Classes NCF-SE 2023 has recommended 120 periods for physical education and well-being in Grade 7. Suggestive timetable assumes at least 5 periods of 40 minute each, per week. NCF-SE recommends allocating block period (2 periods together) for physical education and well- being. If it is not possible to allocate two block periods and one single period every week, it is necessary to design single periods with different focus to ensure sufficient time for activities, game and circle time. Suggestions are given below for two different scenarios of timetable. • Scenario 1 – Five single periods per week. • Scenario 2 – Two block periods for Units 1 to 4 and single period for yoga. Scenario 1: Three different types of sessions have been visualised to effectively use the limited time in each period and achieve the learning outcomes. • Type 1: Maximizes game practice. • Type 2: Maximizes circle time after play to provide sufficient time for discussing cognitive and socio-emotional aspects. • Type 3: Maximizes gamified drills to focus on one specific skill.

To incorporate yoga into our daily routine, it is necessary to practice ‘Yoga in action’ (Karma Yoga), as taught by Shri Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita. The Bhagavad Gita defines yoga as ‘Yogaḥ Karmasu Kauśalam (2.50),’ which means ‘Yoga is skill in action.’ This means doing our tasks in a relaxed and focused way to get the best results. Think about a Kho-Kho player. They are not just running fast; they are also incredibly calm and focused, even when the game gets intense. That is a lesson for all of us. Whether we are studying, playing a sport, or learning a new skill, it is not just about working hard and stressing out. It is about staying calm, focusing our attention and truly enjoying the process. Sri Aurobindo highlights that yoga is about overall personality development at the physical, mental, intellectual, emotional and spiritual levels. It is about growing in all areas of life. Imagine a big tree. For it to be strong and healthy, all its parts—roots, trunk, branches and leaves—must grow together. Similar to this, we must grow in all facts of life to achieve balance and strength. How can we grow in different aspects and achieve holistic development?

Let us understand each Kosha and its role in holistic development. The Pancha Kosha framework helps us understand ourselves better.

We can strengthen our Prana with special exercises like Prānāyāma, Mudra, and Kriyā, helping us feel strong and healthy. 3. Manomaya Kosha (Mind Sheath) This layer is about our thoughts, feelings and perceptions. It is where our emotions and desires come from. It includes what we think, how we feel, and how we react to things. Activities like meditation, mantra chanting (japa), listening to music, singing, painting, and Trataka (focusing on a point) help refine this layer. A calm mind helps you solve problems, stay focused on tasks, and handle challenges easily. When you feel happy or sad, it’s your Manomaya Kosha experiencing those emotions. 4. Vijnanamaya Kosha (Wisdom Sheath) This layer helps us distinguish between right and wrong, good and bad. It is responsible for decision-making, knowledge, wisdom and understanding. Wisdom from this sheath helps us make the right choices, making us better students, friends, family members and responsible citizens of the nation. It also helps us understand our strengths and weaknesses and discover our life’s purpose.

Note for the teacher • Encourage the students to take a walk in nature. Let them notice the pretty things around them and understand how everything works together. For example a tree with birds and small animals on it. • Students can keep a gratitude journal. Let them list five or more things they are grateful for everyday. Activity Different communities have different beliefs and traditions. Give some examples of how people perform rituals and explain the reasons behind their actions. For example, harvest festivals are celebrated to thank the Earth for food. It shows that Earth is alive and deserves our respect."}

Pay attention to your posture to get the most benefit. 7. Stay calm and focused: Avoid talking during practice. Focus on each posture and how your body feels. 8. Cool-down with relaxation: After Āsanas, relax in Shavāsana or another relaxation posture to unwind. 9. Be consistent: Regular practice is better than occasional practice.

Keep practicing and see how it transforms you. Sūkshma Vyāyāma Sūkshma Vyāyāma is a series of gentle exercises designed to loosen the joints, release tension and improve flexibility and strength. The term ‘Sūkshma Vyāyāma’ comes from Sanskrit, where ‘Sūkshma’ means ‘subtle or micro’, and ‘Vyāyāma’ means ‘exercise or movement’. These simple exercises are accessible to everyone with limited mobility, and beginners new to Yoga. They can be performed while sitting or standing. Each movement should be sychronised with the breath, enhancing the flow of Prāṇa (vital energy) throughout the body. This helps eliminate energy blockages in the joints and improves coordination, self-awareness and a sense of well-being. This set of practices promotes deep relaxation and prepares the body and mind for practicing Yogāsanas.

So, Prānāyāma is the way by which we consciously control and direct our breath to make ourselves happier and healthier. Why is Prānāyāma Important for students? Just like we need healthy food to stay physically fit, likewise to keep the body energised and calm the mind, we need to do Prānāyāma practices. It’s especially helpful for students because it helps with focus during studies, staying calm during exams, and even feeling more energised for sports or daily activities. Prānāyāma Prānāyāma Chapter 4 Benefits of Prānāyāma Calms the mind Improves our concentration Feeling more energised Reduces stress"}

You will feel ready to take on your day with more energy and less stress. In this grade let us practice what we had learnt in the previous grade like 1. Sectional Breathing Sectional breathing is a preparatory breathing practice for Prānāyāma. It corrects the wrong breathing pattern and increases the vital capacity of the lungs. 2. Nādīśuddhi Prānāyāma Nādīśuddhi Prāṇāyāma is a simple and powerful technique that balances the flow of Prānā (life force) and cleans the subtle energy channels. 3. Bhrāmarī Prānāyāma Bhrāmarī Prāṇāyāma is a calming technique, which has a soothing effect on the mind and nervous system. (Refer to Khel Yatra Grade 6 textbook for the above practices). Let us learn how to perform Bhrāmarī Prānāyāma by adopting Shanmukhi Mudra: Shanmukhi means six gates or faces. Shanmukhi mudra involves redirecting the awareness inside by closing the six doors of outer perception, the two eyes, the two ears, the nose and the mouth. This practice promotes a state of Pratyāhāra. In other words, it closes the six gates of perception in the head with the fingers of both hands."}

(Makara sound from Omkāra chanting) • Feel the vibration of the sound resonate throughout your head and body. Repeat the practice five times. Benefits of Shanmukhi Mudra • Shanmukhi Mudra calms the mind and nervous system. • It also balances internal and external awareness. • It also enhances focus and helps in managing anxiety. Note for the teacher • Ask the students whether they could feel the resonance during the practice. • Ask about their state of mind after the practice. In this grade let us learn about Bhastrikā Prānāyāma stepwise. Bhastrikā Prānāyāma Bhastrikā is a special breathing exercise that gets its name from ‘bellows’, because it's like breathing in and out like a bellows. You can do it slowly or quickly, whichever feels comfortable. During Bhastrikā, you breathe deeply and fully, so your body gets lots of oxygen. You use your chest like a bellows to breathe in and out strongly."}

Keep the head and spine straight, and close the eyes and relax the whole body. Step 2: Take a deep breath through both nostrils and fill the lungs with air. Step 3: After full inhalation, quickly exhale continuously for 5 times. This completes one round of Bhastrika. Step 4: Continue this practice for 3 rounds. Benefits • Bhastrikā Prānāyāma strengthens the lungs and improves blood circulation. • It relaxes the body and mind and improves concentration. 7 Limitations: The students with the low stamina should avoid this practice.

Have you ever seen pictures of saints or gods with their hands in special positions? These are called hand mudras. Mudras are hand gestures that help connect our body, mind and energy. The word ‘mudra’ means ‘gesture’ or ‘seal’ in Sanskrit. They are like special hand signals that can help our energy flow freely. People have been using mudras for a very long time to feel better physically and mentally. In this grade let us learn about Jnana mudra. Jnana Mudra is an important and simple mudra which calms the mind. Stepwise practice of Jnana mudra 1. Sit in a comfortable posture Sukhāsana or Vajrāsana or on a chair with the back straight. 2. Place your hands on thighs with your palm facing upward. 3. Now gently touch the tip of the thumb with the tip of the index finger. Do not press hard. 4. Stretch the other finger straight, let the palm be facing upward. 5. Keep the focus on your breath. 6. Practice it for 10 minutes every day.

Pratyāhāra is a special tool which helps us to focus. It is a cool way to develop our concentration and remain calm. Pratyāhāra is the 5th step of Ashtāṅga Yoga, which teaches us how to concentrate deeper and stronger. So, in this grade let us learn how to reduce distraction by doing the below activity. Activity to develop focus by engaging your ear to the sound of a bell • Let us listen to the sound of a temple bell. Listen closely as it starts with a strong 'bong!' and then continues to ring. Notice how the ringing changes — it might be loud at first and then become softer and softer until it finally disappears. Try to feel the vibrations of the sound within you."}

Dhārana is like learning to use a focus for your mind. It is about training your mind to pay attention to just one thing, like focusing sunlight with a magnifying glass. When your mind is focused, it helps you study better, concentrate on tasks and mangae your thoughts. You can practice Dhārana by choosing something to focus on, like your breath or a word, and trying to keep your mind from wandering. This skill, along with Dhyāna, helps you find inner peace and is an important part of Yoga. In the previous grade, we learnt about jatru trataka, which improves our focus. Let us continue the practice in this grade. Let us practice Dhārana by focusing on a single point. Jatru Trataka is yogic gazing that helps to bring one pointed concentration or focus. It is a practice where the gaze is fixed on an object or the target. Before starting it is a good idea to cleanse your eyes with cold water. Cleansing of eyes using the palms: Wash your hands with soap thoroughly. Make a cup of your right palm and fill it with clean water. Now, immerse your right eyeball in this water. Blink the eyes for few rounds. Repeat the same practice with the left eye."}

Both Dhārana and Dhyāna can help you focus better in school, stay calm during exams, and feel more peaceful in your everyday life.
