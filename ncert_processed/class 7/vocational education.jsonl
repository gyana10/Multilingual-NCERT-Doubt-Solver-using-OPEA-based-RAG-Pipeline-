The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured the students’ inherent abilities and touching upon all the five planes of human existence, the pañchakośhas, in the foundational and the preparatory stages have paved the way for the progression of their learning further at the middle stage. Thus, the middle stage acts as a bridge between the preparatory and the secondary stages, spanning three years from Grades 6 to 8. The NCF-SE 2023, at the middle stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages, including at least two languages native to India, science, mathematics, social sciences, art education, physical education and well-being, and vocational education, promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy—a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establishing conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks."}
{"class": "class 7", "subject": "vocational education", "page_no": 4, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "iv Kaushal Bodh, the activity book of vocational education for Grade 7, is one of these. Its content comprises projects related to three work forms—life forms, machines and materials, and human services. The projects will help students to develop knowledge, skills, attitude and values alongside ecological sensitivity, gender sensitivity, digital skills, and life skills. For all practical purposes, it has, to my mind, succeeded in its curricular goals: first, to foster natural curiosity among students through a proper selection of project; and second, develop among them the core competencies, such as communication, creativity, critical thinking and green skill and vocational skills, such as application of tools, and procedures for design and developing products by intelligently designing various activities, thereby seamlessly integrating content and pedagogy within meaningful contexts. However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries, laboratories and workshops play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this activity book and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years.

In the National Curriculum Framework 2023 (NCF-SE 2023), work has been categorised under three broad forms: work with life forms, work with machines and materials, and work in human services. The intent at this stage is to provide vocational exposure to the students through a wide range of activities categorised into three forms of work. To achieve this, students are expected to take up nine projects across Grades 6 to 8, i.e., three projects in each grade and one from each form of work. Curricular goals, competencies, and learning outcomes have been the guiding principles while developing the activity book. The following Curricular Goals (CG) given in the activity book cover a range of competencies. CG-1: Develops in-depth basic skills and allied knowledge of work and their associated materials or procedures; CG-2: Understands the place and usefulness of vocational skills and vocations in the world of work; CG-3: Develops essential values while working across areas; and CG-4: Develops basic skills and allied knowledge to run and contribute to a home. The activity book contains six illustrative projects, two for each form of work, intended to cover the above curricular goals. The choice of projects is left entirely to schools. One project may be taken up by students or preferably, the school can design other projects based on local considerations. The NCF-SE 2023, and indeed this activity book, encourages schools to select projects based on local considerations and availability of resources. Annexure 1 provides a template for designing a project other than those in the book. The illustrative projects are as follows: Project 1 is on developing a Plant Nursery. Students will engage in creating and maintaining a plant nursery on school grounds or in pots."}

Project 2 is on developing a School Habitat Garden. Students will study a variety of life within the school premises or nearby areas and learn about the needs of different groups of animals. They will design a garden, including non-plant elements, to meet these needs. This project will enhance their observational skills, knowledge of biodiversity, and the significance of conservation. It will also instill a sense of environmental stewardship and the importance of protecting natural habitats. Project 3 is on Tie and Dye. In this project, students will explore various techniques used for tie and dye. They will learn to use tools and materials to create functional or artistic items, fostering creativity, problem-solving, and technical skills. This project will encourage innovation and creative thinking, preparing students for potential careers in design and fashion. Project 4 is on developing an AI Assistant. It will introduce students to the fundamentals of machine learning. They will learn to train a machine to identify data related to their surroundings. This project will enhance their technological proficiency, creativity, and logical thinking. Project 5 is on Puppetry. Storytime with Puppets project will help students develop the skills of writing a script, making puppets and putting up a show to narrate a story of their choice or to develop awareness. This project will cultivate an appreciation for heritage, enhance organisational skills, and promote teamwork. It will also provide a platform for students to express their creativity. Project 6 is on developing a Family Health Handbook. In this project, students will reflect on the components of physical health and mental well-being. They will learn about the needs of people of different age groups. This project will teach them how to respond in case of ill health, the importance of healthy eating, and the importance of physical activity and social interaction. As the culmination of the work done through the year related to vocational education, a Kaushal Mela will be organised by the school at the end of the year to showcase the products students have created and"}

It will also be an opportunity for students to share their experiences and learnings. Community members and key functionaries may be invited to the Kaushal Mela. Finally, annexures include a planning template, competencies and learning outcomes to be achieved in Grade 7, suggestive projects in each of the forms of work in some detail, and time required for each of the illustrative projects. Cross-cutting themes, such as Indian Knowledge Systems, values, heritage, gender sensitivity, and inclusion have been integrated into all the projects. Reflective and thought-provoking questions included under different activities are engaging and they promote joyful learning along with assessment. Students are provided opportunities to do different things, record small successes, take and give feedback, work with peers, try and re-try tasks, answer questions, reflect, and experience the values related to work. Illustrations have been designed depicting the context and processes to enhance learning. In-text questions are also included to assess comprehension of the idea or the subject. At the end of the project, questions given in ‘Think and Answer’ are designed to encourage critical thinking, reasoning, and analysing. Students can access the additional resources provided in the Quick Response (QR) code for each project. We sincerely hope that students will enjoy doing these projects and they will help develop the desired and intended competencies.

{"class": "class 7", "subject": "vocational education", "page_no": 10, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "Note for School Heads and Teachers Teachers are pivotal to achieving the goals set out in the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 introduces vocational education as a distinct subject starting in Grade 6. The purpose of this subject is to promote ‘learning by doing’, ‘dignity of labour’, and the development of vocational capacities through exposure to a wide range of work. Successful implementation will aid in developing responsible and confident adults who value all professions. Vocational education in schools also offers a robust medium for holistic learning by offering students opportunities to apply conceptual learning in other curricular areas to real-life situations. In Grade 7, students will take up one project in each of the ‘Forms of Work’. The sequence of these projects is not important, so long as all the projects are completed within the academic year. These projects can be taken up at the same time or one after the other. Groups of students may also take up different projects, which depends on the nature of the project and other factors, such as the number of students, resources available, and so on. Please note that it is important to identify concepts across curricular areas that students need to know (e.g., seed germination for projects on Life Forms) and ensure that they have been covered before starting the project. In this activity book, the projects are designed as per the Learning Outcomes for Vocational Education in Grade 7. The focus is on the following: 1. Using physical tools/equipment for carrying out different processes to perform authentic tasks. 2. Gaining clarity about what is to be done and reaching the final outcome through breaking down a task into smaller activities that are easier to complete. 3. Understanding how to prepare materials and use tools and equipment, while following safety measures and protocols. 4. Connecting the activities done in school to the world of work. 5. Assessing work done in terms of quantity and quality. 6. Applying what is learnt in school to daily life. 7. Working collaboratively in groups while ensuring individual participation in each activity."}
{"class": "class 7", "subject": "vocational education", "page_no": 11, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "xi In doing so, students will be able to develop values related to work, particularly respect for all work. They will realise the importance of the dignity of labour, which means that no work is considered superior and therefore, no work or person should be discriminated against on any basis. The projects in the Activity Book are illustrative. Schools can choose to take up any one or design their own from each form of work. Annexure 1 provides guidelines for designing a project in alignment with curricular goals, competencies and learning outcomes. Annexure 3 has details of five additional projects in each form of work. Thus, for each form of work, schools may (i) select one project from each form of work; (ii) design their own projects; (iii) further detail out any one of the additional projects given in the Activity Book. Pedagogy and Assessment Projects comprise a set of activities that are generally expected to be completed in a group or individually, as required. Resources for projects (e.g., tools, equipment, materials, use of workspaces, etc.) and resource persons or master instructors (e.g., mechanics, farmers, craftspersons, artisans, persons working in technology, and experts in the field) must be drawn from the community. Exposure visits and interactions with professionals are built into the project to enable students to observe and understand work in real settings. The total time allotted to vocational education is 110 hours or 165 periods in one academic year, excluding time for assessment, school events, bagless days and similar activities (Section 4.3 of the NCF-SE 2023). These periods may be distributed across the week as two blocks of two periods on week-days and one period on Saturday. Each project is expected to be completed in about 30 hours (approximately 55 periods of 40 minutes each). This duration is to ensure a long-term engagement that allows students to complete a set of interrelated activities. It also gives them time for trial and error, to try out things differently, and to extend their learning into other activities. The focus of the projects must be creativity and demonstration of skills, and the process of ‘doing’ rather than just the ‘product’ or"}

Working in groups and observing people with expertise is important to foster an appreciation for teamwork, creativity, sensitivity, persistence, and other important values related to work. Students must be active throughout, as they take up activities that are directly connected to real life and the world of work. They must be able to integrate learning from other curricular areas into the projects. Prevalent biases must be addressed, for example, by not assigning specific work roles to a particular gender or to students from a specific social group. All students must participate in the activities. To ensure the participation of students with disabilities, projects can be adapted or an entirely different project may be developed. The activity book is designed to enable continuous assessment by teachers, as well as self and peer-assessment by students. The questions and formats for recording require students to assess their own progress, share their learning and reflections, and record their answers as they move from one activity to the next. Students must also maintain a portfolio in order to help them see their own progress, and record the processes and products related to the projects. It may contain any work done by students, including additional notes, presentations, sketches or photographs (besides those in the activity book) related to the project, and products they have created. Assessing the inculcation of values related to work (e.g., initiative, persistence and focus, responsibility, discipline, eye for detail, curiosity and creativity, empathy and sensitivity, and willingness to do physical work) is particularly important. Students must be observed while at work to assess the same. Checklists and rubrics that outline specific behaviours and attitudes related to work values may be developed by the teachers. Annexure 2 contains the competencies to be developed across the middle stage and the learning outcomes to be achieved in Grade 7. While this is true for all subjects, the role of feedback is particularly important in vocational education. Students must be encouraged and motivated by recognition of their work and their creativity. This approach ensures that all students are able to complete their work successfully through ongoing guidance, which in turn is motivating."}

When you think about work, you must remember two things: (i) all work is important, and (ii) people work not only to make a living, but also to make life more joyful and interesting. In daily life, you see people doing various kinds of work. Some of the work is related to running a household while some is related to earning a living. Vocational education prepares you to deal with practical things related to daily life and understand the world of work. The projects that you will do in school will give you an opportunity to work with your hands, work in groups with your peers, and learn the skills which help you become self-dependent in life.

Tiny seeds germinate and grow into a huge tree or a small flowering plant. However, some plants can be grown directly from the branches of the mother plant or tubers (e.g. potatoes). Like humans, plants require a suitable environment to survive and grow. In science, you have learned that plants need air, sunlight, nutrients, and water for their growth. These factors are essential, but beyond them, plants also need a favourable environment to thrive, just like we do. Let us understand this with an example. Do you live in a warm and humid region, a cold and dry region, or a place that experiences different seasons? If you reside in a cold and dry area, you might have heard people say, “It is so dry”, the dryness can cause itchy skin and burning sensation in the nostrils. That is why, when using a heater or bukhari, people often place a bowl of water in the room to add moisture to the air. But what causes humidity or dryness? As you have studied, air contains various components, including water vapour. When there is a high amount of water vapour in the air, the weather feels humid, whereas a lower amount makes the air dry. Just like too much or too little humidity affects us, it also impacts plants, especially during their growth stages. Similarly, extreme temperatures can be uncomfortable for humans, and plants also require an “optimal temperature” to grow. However, the ideal temperature varies among plants, which is why some plants flourish only in specific seasons. Have you observed that more plants grow near a water stream, on the edges of ponds or near water sources (e.g., wells, water-tap) than in dry places? This is because they get optimum temperature, humidity, and moisture in the soil. In the plant nursery (Figure 1.1) you will need to create these conditions for optimum survival and growth of plants."}

Since nurseries are developed in a smaller space compared to farms, it is easier to prevent pests and provide protection from unsuitable conditions like heavy rain or severe heat. Since conditions for healthy growth of plants can be created in plant nurseries, plants can be grown whenever required and not only during the seasons that are generally suitable for them. People visit plant nurseries to buy plants for their homes, gardens and agriculture field. What will I be able to do? At the end of project, you will be able to: 1. Describe the needs of germinating seeds and young plants. 2. Cultivate new plants using different plant propagation methods. 3. Provide suitable conditions for initial growth of plants. 4. Develop a plant nursery in the school. Did you know? Thimmamma Marimanu, a banyan tree located in Ananthapuramu district of Andhra Pradesh, is spread over 5 acres. This is the size of a small village. Imagine! A tree spread so far that it could house an entire village under its branches. Isn’t it fascinating that a single seed has grown into such a big tree?

What do I need to know before I start? There are different types of plant nurseries – some may be for growing vegetables, and others for fruit crops, trees, flowering plants, ornamental plants and so on. Different areas will have different kinds of nurseries. While the process of developing the nursery remains the same, the kind of plants change. In agricultural areas, you will find nurseries for vegetables like brinjal, tomato, onion, etc., and crops like banana. In urban areas, nurseries provide ornamental and flowering plants such as rose, marigold, etc. that can be kept in homes. Where possible, especially in coastal and hilly areas, horticultural nurseries for plants like mango and coconut are set up. Nurseries can be on plots of land or on terraces of buildings. They may be large or small ones maintained at homes. Visiting any one of these will help you to prepare your nursery well. In"}

You can use these methods based on discussion with your peer and the teacher. Method 1: Sowing seeds on raised-bed nursery Step 1: Making raised beds for vegetable or flower seedlings Nursery beds need to be free from weeds and stones. Raised-beds (Figure 1.13) ensure that extra water drains out from the root zone and roots get air for respiration. Follow the steps below to prepare raised-bed: 1. Dig and loosen the soil. 2. Remove bigger stones and pebbles. 3. Mix compost and soil (in a ratio of about 40:60) and raise the marked bed area by 15–20 cm above ground level. 4. The length of the bed could be 3–5 m and width 1–1.5 m. 5. You can maintain a distance of 0.30–0.40 m between two beds for human movement required for watering, weeding, and so on (Figure 1.14).

Apart from cocopeat, minerals like vermiculite and bentonite are used in plant nurseries as growing media. For sowing seeds in a seedling tray: 1. Soak cocopeat in water – 1 kg cocopeat can absorb 5–8 litres of water. 2. After all the water is soaked, fill the trays with the soaked cocopeat gently. 3.

Beyond domestic and farm animals, several other animals share our surroundings, including crows, sparrows, pigeons, owls, kites, bats, monkeys, langurs, squirrels, mice, rats, butterflies, and moths. They lead their busy lives alongside us, adapting to the human-dominated environment. Have you ever wondered where these animals lived before towns and cities replaced farmland and forests? How many of them have managed to adapt to the changes brought about by human expansion? As villages, towns, and cities continue to grow, natural habitats are shrinking, forcing many animals into unfamiliar territories. This habitat loss has led to an increase in sightings of leopards, wolves, and even tigers in urban areas and farmlands. Imagine being suddenly displaced from your home, losing the safety and comfort it provides—this is the challenge these animals are now facing. Figure 2.2: Bird’s nest hanging from the roof of a veranda in a city Figure 2.3: White-throated Kingfisher can be seen on wires near water bodies or parks in cities Animals that can adapt to changes in their habitat continue to coexist with us, while those that cannot retreat into the remaining untouched areas. Take birds, for example—specifically pigeons. Their natural habitat consists of cliffs and rocky hills, which is why they are commonly seen perched on building ledges. In contrast, house sparrows prefer sheltering in dense trees and bushes. As cities expand and green spaces diminish, the sparrow population gradually declines until they eventually disappear from urban landscapes."}
{"class": "class 7", "subject": "vocational education", "page_no": 49, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "27 School Habitat Garden All animals require food and water to survive. Additionally, they need sufficient space to move freely and a safe shelter where they can rest and raise their young ones without fear of predators or exposure to harsh weather conditions. These four essentials— space, shelter, food, and water—form the foundation of every animals’s habitat. However, the specific needs of different animals vary. For instance, in terms of space, carpenter ants can establish a colony within just a few square centimetres, whereas spiders spin webs that are much larger than themselves. Similarly, water sources differ—while butterflies and ants can sip dew droplets from grass, birds often drink from puddles or leaking taps. Shelters also vary; squirrels find safety in trees, while lizards are comfortable on flat concrete surfaces, as few predators can climb walls to reach them. Near human settlements, a diverse range of food is readily available, including human leftovers, flower nectar, leaves, insects, and small animals (Figure 2.4). Additionally, birds find various materials for nest-building in such areas. They collect twigs, dried vegetation, and grass to construct sturdy nests (Figure 2.5). For the nest lining, sparrows often use feathers or even paper, whereas crows incorporate metal wires and ropes to reinforce their nests. Figure 2.4: Insect feeding on nectar of a flower, also helps in the pollination Figure 2.5: A bird gathering material for its nest Once basic needs are fulfilled, habitats must also provide comfort and joy. For example, some birds like bulbul, dove and munia love to bathe in shallow water containers to cool down and clean their feathers."}

These efforts include the establishment of various wildlife sanctuaries and national parks, such as (i) Kaziranga National Park in Assam, renowned for its population of one-horned rhinoceroses, (ii) Bharatpur Bird Sanctuary in Rajasthan, a haven for migratory birds, (iii) Periyar Tiger Reserve in Kerala, dedicated to tiger conservation, (iv) the Butterfly Enclosure within Fambong Lho Wildlife Sanctuary in Sikkim, which provides a safe habitat for diverse butterfly species and (v) Kanha National Park in Madhya Pradesh, which serves as a vital refuge for barasingha (swamp deer) and other wildlife. These are just a few examples among the many protected areas across the country. The term ‘sanctuary’ literally means ‘a safe place where one’s needs are met.’ In the context of wildlife conservation, sanctuaries are typically vast, well-maintained areas managed by experts who ensure the protection and well-being of various species. However, the concept of a sanctuary is not limited to large-scale conservation efforts alone. Even a small habitat garden in your backyard or neighbourhood can serve as a miniature sanctuary, providing shelter, food, and a safe space for birds, butterflies, insects, and other small animals. By creating and nurturing such spaces, individuals can contribute to biodiversity conservation and support local wildlife in their own surroundings. What will I be able to do? At the end of the project, you will be able to: 1. Identify groups of animals in and around the school that can be attracted to the habitat garden. 2. Identify the needs of these groups of animals in terms of space, shelter, food, and water. 3. Describe how these needs can be met within the school habitat garden."}

You may find squirrels, mice, rats, bats, mongoose, and maybe some other small animals, as well as lizards, and frogs. Insects like ants, butterflies, dragonflies, beetles, caterpillars, mosquitoes, and many others are also likely to be around (Figure 2.7).

Fireflies are a species of insects that emit light. A few decades back, entire trees used to be lit up by small lights in some areas of our country, but this is rare now (Figure 2.8). Fireflies live in various habitats but are mostly found in humid, warm environments. Many species thrive in forests and fields or the area between them. As forests and fields are replaced by houses and human population, fireflies are no longer found in the area. Also, as light pollution increases, fireflies cannot signal to each other. This disrupts their life cycle, and the population of fireflies decreases. Thus, fireflies have not been able to adapt into their changed habitat. This poses a serious problem for farmers in these areas. Fireflies are very important for farmers since they feed on insects that harm crops. As their population decreases, farmers have to use chemicals to protect their crop, which in turn has harmful effects on plants and those who consume these plants. Figure 2.8: Fireflies Identification using apps You can use mobile applications to identify birds, butterflies and other insects. Some useful applications are:  Seek by iNaturalist (App): Helps identify insects, butterflies, birds, and animals through image recognition.  PlantNet (App): Helps identify local plant species and understand their importance in conservation.  eBird: Used for logging bird sightings and contributing to a global citizen science database.  Merlin Bird ID (App): Used for identifying bird species by sound or image.  Picture Insect (App): Used for insect identification."}

This causes dust to fly up and then fall through their feathers. Birds do this to remove any tiny insects that may have crept into their feathers and to clean their skin. This is known as dustbathing (Figure 2.10a). 2. Birds take water baths in a similar manner, by wriggling their bodies and flapping their feathers. They are happy to do this in rainwater or in a shallow pool. They do this to clean their feathers and to ensure they are well-maintained for flying (Figure 2.10b). 3. Butterflies also gather around puddles, damp soil or animal droppings. This is known as mudpuddling (Figure 2.10c). They do this to absorb nutrients and also water.

You can make these using waste plywood or bamboo with some help from your teacher. The size of the entrance should match the birds you expect (e.g., small for sparrow, large for owl). \u0007 Similarly, you must have seen birds drinking and bathing in shallow containers filled with water placed by humans. You can use any discarded container to provide water to birds. Just remember to keep them at a height so they are safe from cats or dogs. 2. \u0007Waste puddles and feeders for butterflies: Butterflies, on the other hand, do not like very deep water. For them, you can fill water containers with stones or pebbles, and sand. Add a pinch of salt and compost as well to provide nutrients. Ensure that this puddling area is always kept moist. \u0007 A butterfly feeding area can be created just like feeding areas are created for birds; both need to be at a height but the one for butterflies has to be smaller. For birds, you can put out grains and seeds, while for butterflies you can put out rotting fruit or a sponge soaked in sugar syrup. \u0007 For butterfly shelters you can make narrow and tall wooden boxes with slits instead of holes so that butterflies can enter but birds cannot. These boxes should be placed high above the ground in a place sheltered by winds. 3. \u0007Shelter for beneficial insects: For insects like ladybugs and beetles, you can create a shelter with natural materials like logs, straw, pinecones, and bricks. Simply stack these materials in layers within a wooden frame or crate. Ensure there are small gaps and crevices for insects to nest. Place these shelters near flowering plants or a compost pit, in case there is one in your school. This shelter should be placed 1–3 feet above the ground. \u0007 Wooden logs, dead tree branches, and compost heap with dry leaves attract beetles, ants and similar insects. These can be placed in the corner of the habitat garden. Activity 6: Creating the habitat garden Now that the design is ready, start planting the habitat garden!

As communities migrate, they continue their traditional work even as they become part of the local community already living in the area. One such community, which migrated from Gujarat many centuries India has a rich history of textiles, with each state having its own traditional ways of weaving cloth and creating beautiful patterns using different methods, like dyeing, embroidery and printing. Some of these weaves and patterns have been used across centuries. Among these methods is tie and dye, e.g., Lehariya, Bandhani (Figures 3.1 and 3.2). Bandhani, which literally means ‘to bind or tie’, is a resist dye technique. Resist dye techniques prevent dye from colouring some parts, so that it retains the original colour. Thus, it creates beautiful patterns. Figure 3.2: Bandhani patterns can be created to create intricate designs In the Bandhani method, fabric is folded, tied, twisted, and bound to prevent certain portions from being coloured. Artisans practising this method tie the fabric so that circles, spirals, stripes, and even patterns that appear like plants and animals are created. Bandhani is also known as tie and dye, and is generally practised in Rajasthan and Gujarat. Usually done on cotton, silk, and wool, traditional Bandhani is created using natural dyes made of plants and spices."}

While most of these immigrants got involved in weaving silk, those in Madurai introduced what came to be called the Madurai Sungudi — cotton tie and dye material, generally used for sarees. Thus, tie and dye came to be associated with Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Tamil Nadu too. Another popular resist dye method is wax resist where wax or a starchy paste is applied either freehand or using blocks/stencils, which have patterns carved on them. These patterns can be geometric, or in the shape of animals or plants. This is known as batik, and has traditionally been practised in Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Rajasthan. Bandhani is among the oldest tie and dye techniques. The earliest evidence of Bandhani is found in the Ajanta caves in Maharashtra where paintings show a woman wearing a dotted cloth that is believed to be Bandhani (Figure 3.3). Bandhani is not merely an Indian art form, it also reflects the rich culture of our country. Different colours and styles of Bandhani are associated with different communities and worn with pride in both Rajasthan and Gujarat (Figure 3.4). In some communities, different types of Bandhani are associated with different rituals. Since tie and dye products are created by hand, and no two artisans will tie the fabric in the same way, no two pieces are alike. Thus, each pattern is unique. This project will help you create your own unique tie and dye product.

By the end of this project, you will be able to: 1. Prepare natural dyes using vegetables, fruits, spices and plants. 2. Design patterns for tie and dye. 3. Use tie and dye to create colourful patterns on recycled fabrics. 4. Prepare a product using tie and dye. What will I need? You will need different kinds of tools and materials before you start working: Tools and Materials required 1. Fabric: Fabric used for Bandhani must be strong since it has to undergo multiple rounds of tying and dyeing. Hence, fabric made of natural fibres is used, e.g., cotton, silk, wool. You can use light coloured thin cotton fabric cut out of old clothes. If there are light-coloured linen or silk clothes that have been discarded at home, you can use them as well. You must ensure no traces of starch or dirt remain by washing the fabric carefully. 2. Material for tying: Thread for tying must be white or very light coloured. This is to avoid the colour from ‘bleeding’ from the thread, that is, to prevent the colour of the thread itself from dyeing the fabric. Rubber bands and clips can also be used if large portions are to resist the dye. Grains, pulses, seeds, small stones, peppercorns, etc., can be used to ensure that the area that resists the dye is of the desired size. 3. Material for dyeing and fixing: Natural dyes can be made using a variety of materials, e.g., beetroot, coffee, turmeric, red cabbage, pomegranate, henna, spinach,"}

The following precautions need to be taken during various tasks involved in tie and dye techniques: 1. Wear gloves to protect your hands from warm dyes, and aprons to protect your clothes while using dyes. Use masks to avoid colour splashing on your mouth and prevent breathing in any vapour from the hot dye. Wear goggles to keep your eyes safe from hot water. 2. Work in a well-ventilated area so that smells and vapours do not irritate you. 3. Handle scissors with care while cutting fabric – never point the scissors towards yourself or anyone else. 4. Carefully dispose off any leftover dye solution in the sink. While using the dye, spread plastic sheets on the surface to prevent splashes and to keep the work area safe and clean. Internet safety: Seek help from your teacher while using the Internet. Be careful not to upload or download anything without checking. Do not share personal information anywhere. orange peels, onion skin and indigo. To ensure the colour of the dye does not wash out or fade too soon or bleed from your product onto other clothes (e.g., on a shirt you are wearing), you will need fixers. For example, salt/ vinegar is used to fix the dye when flowers or leaves are used. 4. Tools: Measuring cup/spoon, containers, burner/stove, stirrers, iron, mug, plates, scissors, tongs, glass, bowl.

Visiting a tie and dye workshop will help you to gain firsthand knowledge of the process. You could also invite an artisan to your school to give a demonstration. However, if it is not possible to get an artisan, even a person who does tie and dye as a hobby could be invited. It is quite possible that a tie and dye workshop is not present in the vicinity. In that case, you can visit a dyeing workshop to get an understanding of the process. Activity 1: Visit to a shop You will observe many types of products in the shop, made of different fabrics using different methods, like weaving, embroidery, dyeing, and so on (Figure 3.7). While in the shop, try to get a feel of different fabrics by touching them. See if you can find Bandhani/ Batik/Shibori or any other kind of tie and dye designs.

This resisting of the dye creates patterns due to the difference between the parts that are dyed and not dyed. Tying the fabric in different ways will create different and unique design(s). Experts can tie and dye the same fabric multiple times to introduce colours in the patterns — this is done by dyeing the fabric multiple times, each time tying different parts of the fabric to get a different colour and pattern. However, we will stick to two colours — the original colour of the fabric and the colour of the dye. The technique for tying fabric for Bandhani, Shibori and Leheriya is given in figures 3.11 to 3.13, respectively. Bandhani tying technique Step 1: Draw a design on the fabric using tiny circles/dots. Step 2: Place a mustard seed on the fabric where you want the design element to appear. Pinch a small portion of the fabric around the seed using your fingers. Step 3: Pull the seed up with the fabric and tie it tightly with the thread. Repeat the process for the design you would like to create .

Make sure to keep even spacing for a neat pattern. Step 3: Continue stitching until your entire pattern is outlined with the running stitches. Keep the stitches loose, as they will be gathered later. Step 4: Gently pull the loose ends of the thread to gather the fabric, creating folds. The tighter you pull, the more distinct your design will be. Step 5: Once gathered, tie a firm knot at the end of the thread to hold the folds in place. Make sure it is tight, so the dye does not seep into the folded areas. You can vary the pattern by varying the length of the stitches, the angle of the lines, and where and how tightly you tie the thread. Figure 3.12: Tying technique for Shibori"}

Step 3: Continue folding until the entire fabric is pleated. Hold the fabric firmly to maintain the folds. Step 4: Carefully hold the pleats and tie them tightly with thread at the centre. Ensure the knot is secure to keep the pleats in place. Step 5 : Tie the fabric at equal intervals on both sides of the centre. This will create the Leheriya pattern after dyeing. You can vary the design by decreasing or increasing the number of pleats, as well as the distance at which you tie the thread.

{"class": "class 7", "subject": "vocational education", "page_no": 106, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "84 Kaushal Bodh— Grade 7 What do we mean by intelligence? Intelligence is the ability to learn and to use what you have learnt in new situations. Intelligence keeps growing – the more we deal with new situations, the more our intelligence grows. With advances in technology, machines are also becoming intelligent, just like humans. This is known as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and it is progressing very rapidly – what we did not imagine even a few years back is possible now (Figure 4.1). Before learning about AI, let us discuss how we learn. Imagine that, on the first day of school, you meet many new people. Your brain will try to remember their faces and names, but you may not be able to remember all of them. After few meetings and interactions, your brain will start recognising each person and recalling their names as soon as you see them. After few days of interaction, you will be able to recall many qualities of that person. AI works in a similar way. For example, if we want a machine to recognise an image, we need to show different images of the same object. We do this by uploading these images with proper instructions. Suppose, we want a machine to recognise a banyan tree. We will upload many different images — banyan tree in the shade, in light, different stages of growth (including many pictures of saplings), from different angles, in different geographies, full photos, partial photos — this will have to be done carefully to ensure the machine has maximum possible data related to how a banyan tree looks. We also need to teach the machine to associate images with their name — in this case, ‘banyan tree’. Slowly, as you upload more data and associate it with the name, the machine will start recognising images, even those it has never seen before and connect them to the correct name. You can even teach the machine to connect to other information related to the banyan tree. In this way, you can keep adding the connections the machine can make — e.g., scientific name, conditions for growth, uses, animals who live in it, and whatever else may be useful for humans. This process is called ‘Machine Learning’, and AI makes it possible."}
{"class": "class 7", "subject": "vocational education", "page_no": 107, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "85 AI Assistant Similarly, you can teach the machine to recognise audio recordings of music and sounds — e.g., with a different tone, using different musical instruments — and video recordings — e.g., different backgrounds, different angles. AI is being used in various ways to help humans. AI can be used to automate repetitive tasks, thus, reducing human efforts and increasing productivity. As its use increases, and scientists and engineers explore how it can be expanded, it is fast becoming a part of our everyday lives. Right now, we use AI without even thinking of it. Various apps for navigation while driving, image recognition, translation, and so on are part of our lives. You may have heard of robots that help doctors operate from a city far away from the patient, or robots who can teach students. Till few years back, some of these functions of AI were part of science fiction books and films. And now they are fast becoming a reality. Even though AI may keep learning by itself, as it gathers more information there are certain things it cannot do. For example, can we teach AI to feel emotions? AI may be able to identify various aspects of nature that make it beautiful, but it will be able to convey that an artwork makes you feel good only when you train it to do so – it will never be able to feel emotions as humans do. What will I be able to do? At the end of the project, you will be able to: 1. Understand how AI can be a useful tool for humans. 2. Collect data that can be used to create an AI Assistant. 3. Train a machine to recognise data based on your instructions. 4. Create an AI Assistant to help someone learn about your locality."}

Activity 2: AI can see, listen and speak AI can help people see, listen and speak – after it has been taught to do so. For example, modern hearing aids for people with hearing loss use AI to suppress unwanted noises and amplify other sounds. Thus, a person can hear human speech clearly while the background noise fades into the background. AI can even improve the quality of what is spoken. Some AI tools can distinguish between different speakers, so that the user can follow conversations correctly. Thus, AI can listen. Did you know? Prof. Stephen William Hawking was a famous scientist, who made many important discoveries about the universe. But what was unique about him was that he was suffering from an illness from the age of 21 years that led to slow paralysis of his entire body. Gradually, he lost the ability to speak. However, Prof. Hawking used AI to communicate. Initially, he used a system that helped him select words on a computer screen by tracking movements of his cheek muscles. The words he selected were converted to speech. Figure 4.3: Prof. Stephen Hawking AI can help people with visual impairment through AI enabled glasses with sensors that can detect light and images.

Storytelling has been prevalent from ancient times and different forms of storytelling have evolved over time. The paintings in the Ajanta caves in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar in Maharashtra, made between the second century BCE and fifth century CE, are one form of storytelling—they depict stories from the Jataka tales through paintings. India also has a tradition of oral storytelling, which has continued until today, through Baul songs in Bangla, Dastangoi in Urdu, Katha in different languages, Kavad in Rajasthan, Yakshagana in Kerala and Karnataka, and Ram Leela across the country. Kavad is narrated using a wooden shrine that opens as the story unfolds. Yakshagana and Ram Leela use music, masks, and costumes, along with dialogues. Traditionally, these performances were done without a written script. Figure 5.2: Shadow puppet show uses light and the shadow of puppets to tell stories from our ancient epics The forms in which stories are told keep changing—for example, in modern times, writing is a popular form of storytelling. Along with writing, photography, cinema, animation, and many other forms are used for storytelling. Sadly, some of the traditional forms are not as popular as they were till a few decades back — some people prefer more modern forms of storytelling. But one form that has persisted is using puppets to tell stories (Figures 5.1 and 5.2). Puppets are human or animal figures that can be moved by the puppeteer. Therefore, a clockwork doll will not be considered a puppet but a simple sock with eyes, nose, and mouth stitched"}

Puppetry is the art of moving puppets either by hand, rods or strings to narrate a story. You may have already learnt about puppets in Art Education. You might have also learnt about the different kinds of puppets used in our country. The advantage of puppetry is that you can put up a show with even one or two humans and a few puppets. This show can be easily taken from place to place and used to narrate a variety of stories. Puppet shows have been used to share sensitive social messages that people may hesitate to discuss otherwise or even to involve people who may otherwise stay aloof. Since the puppet, and not the human is speaking, the audience will listen and laugh about things that would otherwise make them angry or upset. For example, puppets have been used to discuss addiction, superstition and other ills in society. They have been used to motivate people to act against injustice. Did you know? Between 2012 and 2014, archaeologists excavated a site belonging to the Sindhu–Sarasvati civilisation at Karanpura in Rajasthan, situated along the river Chautang. Among the many discoveries was what appeared to be a puppet- headed bull (Figure 5.3). Although its head is missing, archaeologists have observed that the shape of the artefact is such that a detachable head could be placed on it. There are also two shallow grooves through which a string could be passed to make the head move. Figure 5.3: Puppet headed bull"}

What is the plot of the story? Write the sequence of the main events. What is the central message of the story? Activity 4: Writing a script for the puppet show When you see a live performance or watch a film, there are dialogues, changes in scenes, music, action, and many other things. It is much more than just narrating a story. Translating a story into a show is done using a script. A script has the step-by-step flow of scenes, dialogues and emotions of the characters. It also contains details, like the position and movement of the puppet(s) during each scene. Elements like short songs or poems, light and sound effects, and so on must be mentioned in the script. The style of speaking has to be made clear, e.g., natural, casual, formal, authoritative, submissive, and so on depending on the character and the scene. Try and select a story that has at least 2–3 characters. These characters can be animals, humans, aliens – as per the story. To help you understand how to write the script, an example of a story called ‘Gopal and the Hilsa Fish’ is given in Table 5.2. This story is about a king who does not like people talking about the Hilsa fish in the court. He challenges Gopal, his courtier, to buy a huge Hilsa fish and bring it to the palace without anyone talking about it. Gopal accepts the challenge. He shaves half his beard and smears ash on himself. People are so surprised by his appearance that they do not talk about the big Hilsa fish in his hand."}

Would they be outgoing or shy? These are known as characteristics. Deciding the characteristics of your puppet is known as making a character sketch. This is necessary for deciding the face and body of the puppet, its expression, its voice, and mannerisms, for example, jumping up and down when Please note that props are objects other than puppets (Figure 5.4) used on stage. They are used to clearly show the setting (e.g., the king’s throne) and can easily be moved around (e.g., Hilsa fish, sword, ball, car, newspaper).

Making the body There are different ways in which a puppet’s body can be built. Figure 5.17 shows one way to make a human puppet. Step 1 Take an old fabric and cut it in the shape of a long dress. The dimensions should be such that the rod or stick attached to the puppet head is covered. Step 2 Stitch the cloth using thread and needle. Step 3 You can also make a shirt and long skirt or pants and attach it to the puppet if you wish. Step 4 You can draw hands on a piece of cardboard on the paper.

This is possible by making more than one puppet for each character with different expressions and positions. Finalising your puppets You have experimented with various puppets. Now, start working towards making the puppets for your show. Please fill table 5.4 as this will help you plan your puppets. An example is given in the table to help you add details about your puppets. Table 5.4: Planning your puppets Types of puppet (e.g., human or animal) and their names What materials did you use? What did you do? How will the puppets move? How will you use these puppets? Two human heads made of balls, named Rajesh and Geeta Ball, broomstick, sketch pen Ball gives the shape of a head.

Now you are ready to prepare for the show. Activity 7: Puppet show Start rehearsing with the puppets. Make sure everyone is clear about their responsibilities to ensure a great show. Some of you can be puppeteers, others can give light and sound effects, and can change the backdrop as the scenes change. There might be other things that need to be done based on your story. It is extremely important to have the following elements to have a great puppet show: a. Stage The space where the show is performed, is very important. First, there must be scope to create a ‘stage’ so that the audience can clearly see the puppets. Second, there must be space for the audience to sit. There are different ways to set a stage (Figures 5.21 to 5.23). Figure 5.21: A bedsheet covering a table is used as a stage. The bedsheet will hide the puppeteer, who can move the puppets using their hands or sticks attached to the puppets’ bodies."}

In case the puppeteer uses strings, the sheet can be tied to a string behind the table like a curtain. Figure 5.23: A frame used as a stage for a puppet show. The frame should ideally be a rectangle (just like watching a film in the theatre). It can be made with different materials, but take care that the size of the ‘window’ is large enough for the puppets and their movement to be clearly visible. Remember, you need to keep the puppets which you will use for the show, close to the stage where the audience cannot see them. For example, you can keep the puppets behind the cloth used to cover the table. 1.

As the scene changes, the backdrop changes as well. You can even draw the backdrops on a curtain and slide them using hooks or hoops. 1. Briefly describe the backdrop(s) you have prepared. .............................................................................................................. .............................................................................................................. c. Props The kind of props will depend on how they are to be used. For example, we can use thick cardboard to create a chair, bed, or a throne, and so on. However, if the prop is being used or held by the puppeteer, it must be very light. Props can be made using simple materials, such as paper (e.g., newspaper, chapati), aluminium (e.g., sword, knife), cardboard or disposable containers (e.g., gas stove, plates) (Figure 5.25). 1. Briefly describe the props you have prepared. .............................................................................................................. .............................................................................................................. d. Voice Voice modulation plays an extremely powerful role in puppetry; the puppeteer acts through her or his voice. You must assign distinct voices to each puppet to differentiate the characters. For example, a lion puppet could have a deep, commanding voice, while a rabbit could have a high- pitched, playful voice. To make sure the audience understands what you are saying, speak clearly and loudly. Practice showing emotions, like happiness, fear, or excitement using voice Figure 5.25: A tree used as a prop to show that a monkey is plucking an apple from the tree. The monkey’s hand is moved using the stick attached to it."}

Practice playing sound or singing together wherever required. Practice is key for the success of your efforts. e. Sound and music You should have different types of sounds in the puppet show depending on the script – background music or sounds effects, like thundering of clouds before rain. You can use musical instruments or create sounds by tapping on the floor or the desk using a pencil, scale or your fingers. You can tap on a glass or bottle with different levels of water to create music for your show. You can experiment with different sound effect using the sound system; for example, whistling into a microphone creates the sound of the wind (Figure 5.26).

However, if the show is in a dark space, you need to plan the placement of lights. For example, you can use a torch behind curtains to show the moon, sun or a magic lamp. You can also use fairy lights, table lamps, earthen pots (diya), etc. Refer to your script (Table 5.3) to decide lighting effects and how you will generate them. g. Puppeteer The puppeteer needs to rehearse the dialogues well. Remember, the puppet is speaking, not you. You should also know when the puppet will enter the stage— ‘in’ and when to exit the stage — ‘out’. Secondly, the puppeteer should look at the puppet while the puppet talks to the audience. This means that as a puppeteer your face needs to be flat without emotions, so that the audience looks at the puppet and not at you. Activity 8: Putting up a puppet show Now, it is time for the show.

You become more flexible and stronger while being able to concentrate on whatever you are doing. You have also learnt that a nutritious and well-balanced diet is necessary to meet the body’s needs. Different components of food are necessary to fulfil different needs of the body, and give us energy to work and play. In addition to this, rest is very important. Our body repairs itself when we sleep, and we wake up refreshed and ready for another day. Depending on age, sleeping for a certain number of hours daily is, therefore, very important for health. Positive attitude and mental well-being are equally important. A well-balanced diet, regular exercise, personal hygiene, positive thoughts, and kindness are important for mental well-being. Along with these, it is important to do things you enjoy and to spend time with loved ones. Still, despite all these efforts, people fall ill due to various reasons, including environmental factors.

These are some recommendations by health experts. Diet and Nutrition 1. Meal Frequency: Eating three main meals and 1–2 healthy snacks at consistent intervals prevents overeating or dips in energy. 2. Hydration: Drinking at least 6–8 glasses of water daily is essential for digestion, temperature regulation, and mental focus. 3. Eat home cooked food and limit eating processed food: Even a ‘simple meal’ like dal fry and rice ordered from outside may not be healthy since you are unsure of the amount of oil added or whether the dal is freshly cooked or stale. Therefore, limiting food ordered from outside, processed snacks (e.g., chips), sugary drinks, and fried foods is good for health. Sleep Pattern 1. Sleep duration varies by age. Ideally, about 9–11 hours of sleep is ideal for students aged 6-13, while about 8–9 hours of sleep is sufficient for adults. Children below the age of 5 require more than 11 hours of sleep. 2. Healthy body functioning is also determined by a regular sleep schedule (going to bed and waking up at the same time daily); this helps regulate the body’s internal clock. 3. Disruptions like noise, bright lights, or uncomfortable bedding can affect sleep patterns. 4. To go to sleep easily, avoid stimulating activities, like screen time, loud music, or heavy meals an hour before sleep. Physical Fitness 1. Lack of physical activity and a sedentary lifestyle can have a very harmful effect on body functions in the long run. 2. Consistency is key, so you should choose a physical activity that you like. It can be yoga, sports or a simple walk.

You have identified factors that affect health and may have noted some questions. As you continue to work on your project, you will try and find answers to these questions. You will understand the needs of persons of different age groups and identify environmental factors around you that may affect health. You will also learn how to provide first-aid, and how to avail medical care. Finally, you will come up with an action plan to improve and maintain your and your family’s health. All this will be part of your family health handbook. Mental Well-being Just as our physical well-being can be affected by many factors, our mental well-being is also prone to being affected. For example, due to a fight with a friend, examination stress, concerns about family, or any other reason. Mental and physical well-being are interconnected, and both are equally important.

Each family is different, e.g., some families have parents and one or more children, some are joint families with many generations living in the same house, some are only made up of one parent and a child – many variations are possible. However, most of us will have people of all ages in our extended families, or family friends of different ages. With this in mind, collect and document basic health data and some observations related to daily routine for the following age groups: (i) Below 5 years, (ii) 6–18 years, (iii) 19–30 years, (iv) 31–45 years, (v) 46–60 years, (vi) above 60 years. Even if you do not have a family member from any of these age groups, you can collect information from a relative/neighbour/friend. You can make separate sections for every age group using 3–4 sheets, or as required, for each member in your handbook. Few examples of questions you can ask are given in table 6.1. Add to these questions as per your need. All questions may not be relevant for particular persons; you may skip those. For children in the age group under 5 years, fill the information after speaking to their parents. Table 6.1: Tabulation of basic health data Name Relation with the student Gender Age"}

You can do this through the Kaushal Mela. But first, you must plan each detail carefully. Planning is important since it helps you decide how to reach your goal. You must think about what need to be done and when it needs to be done so that everything goes smoothly. For example, if you are putting up a puppet show, you need to decide when and where keeping in mind that the maximum number of people watch it. Planning also helps to prevent wastage of time and resources. For example, if you want to demonstrate the tie and dye process, you must ensure all the materials are available in one place in the right quantity. Since the Kaushal Mela will involve a lot of planning and coordination, you must plan each detail carefully. Responsibilities must be assigned for each activity, and the process for each activity discussed in detail. You must also develop a plan to work together as a team.
