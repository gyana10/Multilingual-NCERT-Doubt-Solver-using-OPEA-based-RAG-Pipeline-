At the same time, it aims to prepare students to engage constructively with the opportunities and challenges of the twenty-first century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. By nurturing students’ inherent abilities across all five planes of human existence (pañchakośhas), the Foundational and Preparatory Stages set the Stage for further learning at the Middle Stage. Spanning Grades 6 to 8, the Middle Stage serves as a critical three-year bridge between the Preparatory and Secondary Stages. The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It aims to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages—including at least two languages native to India— to Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas, as these textbooks are intended to play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy’s role that helps strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups (CAGs), which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. Ganita Prakash, the textbook of mathematics for Grade 8 (Part 1) is designed to make learning fun, engaging, and meaningful. Aligned with NEP 2020 and NCF-SE 2023, the textbook continues to foster the spirit of experiential and inquiry-based learning, a spirit already introduced in the mathematics textbooks for Grades 6 and 7. It encourages students to ask questions, think critically, and understand concepts of mathematics through real-world contexts."}
{"class": "class 8", "subject": "maths", "page_no": 4, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "iv The textbook makes efforts to encourage the students to observe and explore patterns around them and discover mathematical concepts on their own. The content is structured in a way that supports a joyful and progressive understanding of increasingly complex concepts, easing students into more advanced learning. The content attempts to integrate mathematics with other subject areas, such as Science, Social Science with cross-cutting themes like environmental education, value education, inclusive education, and Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS). At most of the places the concept begins with either a story or a puzzle that not only makes students think but also feels the importance of the concept. However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook, and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years. \b Dinesh Prasad Saklani \b Director New Delhi\b National Council of Educational June 2025\b Research and Training"}
{"class": "class 8", "subject": "maths", "page_no": 5, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "ABOUT THE BOOK Mathematics helps students develop not only basic arithmetic skills, but also the crucial capacities of logical reasoning, creative problem-solving, and clear and precise communication (both oral and written). Mathematical knowledge also plays a crucial role in understanding concepts in other school subjects, such as Science and Social Science, and even Arts, Physical Education, and Vocational Education. Learning Mathematics contributes to the development of capacities to make informed choices and decisions. Understanding numbers and quantitative arguments is necessary for effective and meaningful democratic and economic participation. Mathematics thus plays an important role in achieving the overall aims of school education. Mathematics at the Middle Stage is a major challenge and performs the dual role of being both close to the experience and environment of a learner and being abstract. It performs the role of developing intuition, while also maintaining and emphasising rigour. It is enhancing critical and logical thinking, while also developing artistry and creativity, and a sense of elegance and aesthetics. Mathematics provides students with plenty of opportunities to explore and discover concepts on their own while also teaching the best-known methods in the global repertoire of mathematics. This textbook attempts to address the goals and challenges of learning mathematics. The writers have aimed to strike a judicious balance between informal and formal definitions and methods in helping students to develop both intuition and rigour. The textbook also provides numerous opportunities for student-student and student–teacher interaction in the classroom to promote active and experiential learning. A number of questions, puzzles, and interactive exercises are posed throughout the textbook to encourage constant exploration. Many of the questions are open-ended to stimulate classroom discussion. The Chapter 1: ‘A Square and A Cube’ is an introduction to the special types of numbers called squares and cubes through engaging explorations, and contexts. Chapter 2: ‘Power Play’ considers short and logical ways of expressing very large numbers, and discusses how they can be written and read without ambiguity. Chapter 3: ‘A Story of Numbers’ reveals how the idea of number and number representation evolved over the course of time, across different places in the world, to finally reach its modern efficient form. Chapter 4: ‘Quadrilaterals’ discusses some interesting types of four-sided figures and problems based on them. Chapter 5: ‘Number Play’ shows different properties of numbers studied by the students with a balance of engaging activities"}

Chapter 6: ‘We Distribute, Yet Things Multiply’ covers aspects related to Algebra, and in particular, the distributive law. Chapter 7: ‘Proportional Reasoning’ explores a new way to compare two quantities using daily life situations. In all the chapters, an attempt has been made to emphasise connections with other subjects including Art, History and Science. By weaving storytelling and hands-on activities together, as done in Grades 6 and 7, we hope that an immersive learning experience will be created that ignites curiosity and fosters a love for mathematics. It is hoped that teachers would give students the opportunity to discuss, play, engage with each other and provide logical arguments for different ideas, and find loopholes in arguments presented. This is necessary for the learners to eventually develop the ability to understand what it means to prove something and also become confident about the underlying concepts. The mathematics classroom should not expect a blind application of algorithms but should rather encourage students to find many different ways to solve problems. As per the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, computational thinking has also been gently introduced through puzzles, games, and interactive exercises that encourage students on these aspects. Indian rootedness has also been kept in mind while giving contexts for different concepts. The contributions of Indian mathematicians have also been given as part of a problem-solving approach to make students aware of India’s rich mathematical heritage and its global contributions to mathematics. The concepts and problems in this textbook are related to daily life situations. An attempt has been made to use contexts and materials that students are familiar with. Learning material sheets have been given at the back of the book that may be photocopied and used in the classroom. Exercises or activities are often given to encourage peer group efforts and discussions. However, this textbook intends to address the learning needs of a diverse group of students in the classroom. We have tried to link concepts learnt in initial chapters with ideas in subsequent chapters, to show the connectedness and unity of mathematics. We hope that teachers can revise these concepts in a spiralling way so that students are able to appreciate the entire conceptual structure of mathematics. We hope that teachers may focus more on the ideas of squares and cubes, exponents, evolution of numbers and other notions that are new to the students, and are foundational for further learning. Finally, this textbook aims to be more than just a textbook — it is a passport to a world of mathematical discovery and exploration. Whether used in the classroom or at home, we hope that it inspires"}

This task calls for providing a fertile environment that allows for the flowering of mathematical thinking in the minds of students. Classrooms,where students just listen and write down whatever is being told to them or written on the board, are deficient in the conditions required for learning mathematics. Instead, classrooms need to be places where students are engaged in playing with mathematical concepts, finding and discussing patterns, and developing creative strategies together to solve problems. Students should also be posing problems to each other and discussing possible solutions with each other. In fact, these are the very conditions that have led to the development of the entire field of mathematics so far, and so one cannot expect students to pick up mathematical thinking and understanding without these conditions. Fortunately, it is not difficult to create such conditions in the classroom. It just requires an interesting question, problem, pattern, or challenge to be thrown open to the students on a regular basis, and sufficient time to be given to them to play with, discuss, and work on it as a class or in pairs or groups. Along with it, an environment that accepts mistakes and acknowledges their importance in learning needs to be nurtured. While creating the spark for initiating mathematical thinking in classrooms is not difficult, sustaining it may be challenging and may involve efforts from your side. Nevertheless, even if just the first part of throwing open a question, problem, pattern, or challenge is done at least once or twice a week, accompanied by sufficient waiting time from your side for students to play, discuss, and work on it, it can have a great positive impact on how the students view and approach mathematics. It should be noted that this positive impact will not happen overnight. That takes time and depends on various factors such as the number of opportunities you give for problem solving, your patience, and the encouragement you give to the students. To support you in posing problems, all the problems or questions in this book are marked using the icons and . These icons are indicators of potential opportunities to start off a process of problem-solving and exploration in the classroom. You will find some of the problems labelled ‘ Math Talk ’. Such questions can especially be made as topics for classroom discussion."}

These can be brought out during classroom discussions, both where the owl is present and also in other similar situations. In this grade, justification/proofs of mathematical statements find an increased presence. Students should be gently encouraged to deduce properties and not be forced to do it. Whenever students face challenges in doing it, encourage them to experiment and observe, and use their intuition in figuring out properties. Providing justification/ proof is a skill that takes time to develop. To develop students’ mathematical thinking and understanding of concepts, a sufficient number of problems are given. Trying to ‘cover’ all of them must not happen at the cost of students not getting to spend quality time on playing with and discussing them. It is important to understand that the exploratory problems are not only for promoting problem solving skills; they also serve in strengthening procedural fluency when children start engaging in exploration. Efforts must be made in making students independent learners. One essential aspect required for this is an ability to read and understand mathematical text. To promote this skill, students should be encouraged to read the book by themselves and in groups. Give opportunities to them to interpret what they read and express it to others. This will also address the big problem that students face in speaking mathematics and interpreting word problems. This textbook contains a number of open-ended problems. It also contains new treatments of certain concepts. If you are not able to solve them or follow some of them immediately, it is perfectly okay! Not everyone knows everything. Along with trying to understand and reflect upon such content,it will be very useful to take it to the classroom and open it up for discussion. After the discussion, things that are clear and those that are not yet clear can be clearly summarised. This process itself can throw a lot of light on the content. In these discussions, you can participate as a fellow seeker, and when students see a teacher seek and think to understand something, it sets a wonderful example for them. It is hoped that you and your students will have a great and fruitful time using this textbook!"}

When you encounter these, pause your reading, and use your creativity to work out the question or understand and appreciate the pattern. You will find that some questions are accompanied by their answers. Even if this is the case, it is worthwhile to work on the problems by yourself or in a group before you see the answer.

Her son Khoisnam and their 99 relatives were invited to the reading of her will. She wanted to leave all of her ratnas to her son, but she knew that if she did so, all their relatives would pester Khoisnam forever. She hoped that she had taught him everything he needed to know about solving puzzles. She left the following note in her will— “I have created a puzzle. If all 100 of you answer it at the same time, you will share the ratnas equally. However, if you are the first one to solve the problem, you will get to keep the entire inheritance to yourself. Good luck.” The minister took Khoisnam and his 99 relatives to a secret room in the mansion containing 100 lockers. The minister explained— “Each person is assigned a number from 1 to 100. • Person 1 opens every locker. • \u0007Person 2 toggles every 2nd locker (i.e., closes it if it is open, opens it if it is closed). • Person 3 toggles every 3rd locker (3rd, 6th, 9th, … and so on). • Person 4 toggles every 4th locker (4th, 8th, 12th, … and so on). This continues until all 100 get their turn. In the end, only some lockers remain open. The open lockers reveal the code to the fortune in the safe.” Before the process begins, Khoisnam realises that he already knows which lockers will be open at the end. How did he figure out the answer? Hint: Find out how many times each locker is toggled. A SQUARE AND A CUBE 1"}

Otherwise, it will be closed. The number of times a locker is toggled is the same as the number of factors of the locker number. For example, for locker #6, Person 1 opens it, Person 2 closes it, Person 3 opens it and Person 6 closes it. The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 6 are factors of 6. If the number of factors is even, the locker will be toggled by an even number of people and it will eventually be closed. Note that each factor of a number has a ‛partner factor’ so that the product of the pair of factors yields the given number. Here, 1 and 6 form a pair of partner factors of 6, and 2 and 3 form another pair. Does every number have an even number of factors? We see in some cases, like 2 × 2, that the numbers in the pair are the same. Can you use this insight to find more numbers with an odd number of factors? For instance, 36 has a factor pair 6 × 6 where both numbers are 6. Does this number have an odd number of factors? If every factor of 36 other than 6 has a different factor as its partner, then we can be sure that 36 has an odd number of factors. Check if this is true. Hence all the following numbers have an odd number of factors — 1 × 1, 2 × 2, 3 × 3, 4 × 4, ... A number that can be expressed as the product of a number with itself is called a square number, or simply a square. The only numbers that have an odd number of factors are the squares, because they each have one factor which, when multiplied by itself, equals the number. Therefore, every locker whose number is a square will remain open. 6: 1 × 6 2 × 3 Factors are 1, 2, 3 and 6. 1: 1 × 1 The only factor is 1. 4: 1 × 4 2 × 2 Factors are 1, 2 and 4. 9: 1 × 9 3 × 3 Factors are 1, 3 and 9."}

Yes, there area in square units are ( 3 5) 2 = ( 3 5) × ( 3 5) = ( 9 25), and (2.5) 2 = (2.5) × (2.5) = 6.25.

None of them end with 2, 3, 7 or 8. If a number ends in 0, 1, 4, 5, 6 or 9, is it always a square? The numbers 16 and 36 are both squares with 6 in the units place. However, 26, whose units digit is also 6, is not a square. Therefore, we cannot determine if a number is a square just by looking at the digit in the units place. But, the units digit can tell us when a number is not a square. If a number ends with 2, 3, 7, or 8, then we can definitely say that it is not a square. Write 5 numbers such that you can determine by looking at their units digit that they are not squares. The squares, 12, 92, 112, 192, 212, and 292, all have 1 in their units place. Write the next two squares. Notice that if a number has 1 or 9 in the units place, then its square ends in 1. Let us consider square numbers ending in 6: 16 = 42, 36 = 62, 196 = 142, 256 = 162, 576 = 242, and 676 = 262. Math Talk Math Talk"}

The picture below explains why each subsequent inverted L gives the next odd number: We see that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n2. Alternatively, every square is a sum of successive odd numbers starting from 1. Also, we can find out whether a number is a perfect square by successively subtracting odd numbers. Consider the number 25, successively subtract 1, 3, 5, ... until you get or cross over 0, This means 25 = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 and is thus a perfect square. Since we subtracted the first five odd numbers, 25 = 52. Using the pattern above, find 362, given that 352 = 1225. From the question we know that 1225 is the sum of the first 35 odd numbers. To find 362, we need to add the 36th odd number to 1225. How do we find the 36th odd number? The 1st odd number is 1, 2nd odd number is 3, 3rd number is 5, …, 6th odd number is 11 and so on. What is the nth odd number? The nth odd number is 2n–1. Therefore, the 36th odd number is 71. By adding 71 to 1225, we get 1296, which is 362.

That is 64 too! 82 = 64, and (– 8)2 = 64. So, the square roots of 64 are + 8 and – 8. Every perfect square has two integer square roots. One is positive and the other is negative. The square root of a number is denoted by Thus, 64 8 =± and 100 10 =± . Note that 8 8 2 =± and 10 10 2 =± . In general, n n 2 =± . In this chapter, we shall only consider the positive square root. Given a number, such as 576 or 327, how do we find out if it is a perfect square? If it is a perfect square, how can we find its square root? We know that perfect squares end in 1, 4, 9, 6, 5, or an even number of zeros. But, it is not certain that a number that satisfies this condition is a square. We can clearly say that 327 is not a perfect square. However, we cannot be sure that 576 is a perfect square. 1. We can list all the square numbers in sequence and find out whether 576 occurs among them. We know that 202 = 400, we can find squares of 21, 22, 23, … and so on until we get 576 or a number greater than 576. 202 = 400 212 = 441 222 = 484 232 = 529 242 = 576 \u0007However, this process becomes inefficient for larger numbers. 2.

We know that a perfect square is obtained by multiplying an integer by itself. Will looking at a number’s prime factorisation help in determining whether it is a perfect square? \u0007 Yes, if we can divide the prime factors of a number into two equal groups, then the product of the prime factors in either group combine to form the square root. Is 324 a perfect square? 324 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3. These can be grouped as 324 = (2 × 3 × 3) × (2 × 3 × 3). = (2 × 3 × 3)2 = 182. We can also write the prime factors in pairs. That is, 324 = (2 × 2) × (3 × 3) × (3 × 3), which shows that 324 is a perfect square. Thus, 324 = (2×3×3)2 = 182. Therefore, 324 =18. Is 156 a perfect square? The prime factorisation of 156 is 2 × 2 × 3 × 13. We cannot pair up these factors. Therefore, 156 is not a perfect square. Find whether 1156 and 2800 are perfect squares using prime factorisation. We can estimate the square root of larger perfect squares by looking at the closest perfect squares we are familiar with and then narrowing down the interval to search. For example, to find 1936 , we can reason as follows: (i) 1936 is between 1600 (402) and 2500 (502), so 40 < 1936 < 50. (ii) The last digit of 1936 is 6. So, the last digit of the square root must either be 4 or 6. It can be 44 or 46. (iii) If we calculate 452, we can compare it with 1936 to halve the interval to search from 40–50 to either 40–45 or 45–50. We can write 452 as (40 + 5) (40 + 5) = 402 + 2 × 40 × 5 + 52 = 1600 + 400 + 25 = 2025. (iv) 2025 > 1936. So, 40 < 1936 < 45 (v) From the observation in point b we can guess and then verify that 1936 is 44. Consider the following situations — Aribam and Bijou play a game.

The game goes on till Aribam says 250. Bijou is not able to answer because 250 is not a perfect square. Aribam asks Bijou if he can at least provide a number that is close to the square root of 250. For this, Bijou needs to estimate the square root of 250. We know that 100 < 250 < 400 and 100 = 10 and 400 = 20. So, 10 < 250 < 20. But, we are still not very close to the number whose square is 250. We know that 152 = 225 and 162 = 256. Therefore, 15 < 250 < 16. Since 256 is much closer to 250 than 225, 250 is approximately 16. We also know it is less than 16. Here is another problem that requires estimating square roots. Akhil has a square piece of cloth of area 125 cm2.

H. Hardy at the University of Cambridge, Hardy had come to visit Ramanujan at a hospital when he was ill. Hardy had ridden in a taxicab numbered 1729 and he remarked that 1729 was ‘rather a dull number,’ adding that he hoped that this was not a bad sign. Ramanujan immediately replied, “No, Hardy, it is a very interesting number. It is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways”. 1729 = 13 + 123 = 93 + 103. Because of this story, 1729 has since been known as the Hardy– Ramanujan Number. And numbers that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways are called taxicab numbers. The next two taxicab numbers after 1729 are 4104 and 13832. Find the two ways in which each of these can be expressed as the sum of two positive cubes. How did Ramanujan know this? Well, he loved numbers. All through his life, he tinkered with numbers.

His colleague, John Littlewood, once said, “Every positive integer was one of his [Ramanujan's] personal friends”. Try This"}

In ancient Sanskrit works the term varga was used both for the square figure or its area, as well as the square power, and the term ghana was used both for the solid cube as well as the product of a number with itself three times. The fourth power was called varga-varga . These terms were used in India at least from the third century BCE. Aryabhata (499 CE) states “A square figure of four equal sides and the number representing its area are called varga. The product of two equal quantities is also called varga.” Thus, the term varga for square power has its origin in the graphical representation of a square figure. Why is the word ‘root’ (the root of a plant) used for the mathematical operation √ (square root, cube root, etc.)? It is because, in ancient India, the Sanskrit word mula, meaning root of a plant, basis, cause, origin, etc., was used for the mathematical operations of taking roots. In Sanskrit, varga-mula (the basis, cause, origin of the square) was used for square-root and ghana-mula was used for cube-root. This use of mula for the mathematical concept of root was subsequently emulated in Arabic and Latin through their corresponding words for the root of a plant — jidhr and radix respectively. The term mula for root has been used in India at least from the first century BCE. Another term used was pada (foot, basis, cause, origin).

Take a sheet of paper, as large a sheet as you can find. Fold it once. Fold it again, and again. How many times can you fold it over and over? Estu says “I heard that a sheet of paper can’t be folded more than 7 times”. Roxie replies “What if we use a thinner paper, like a newspaper or a tissue paper?” Try it with different types of paper and see what happens. Say you can fold a sheet of paper as many times as you wish. What would its thickness be after 30 folds? Make a guess. Let us find out how thick a sheet of paper will be after 46 folds. Assume that the thickness of the sheet is 0.001 cm. If you can fold a paper 46 times, it will be so thick that it can reach the Moon! What! That’s crazy! Just 46 times!? You must have ignored several zeros after 46. Well, why don’t you find out yourselves."}

This is the power of multiplicative growth, also called exponential growth. Let us analyse the growth. We have seen that the thickness doubles after every fold. Notice the change in thickness after two folds. By how much does it increase? After any 3 folds, the thickness increases 8 times (= 2 × 2 × 2). Check if that is true. Similarly, from any point, the thickness after 10 folds increases by 1024 times (= 2 multiplied by itself 10 times), as shown in the table below. Fold Thickness Times increased by 0 to 10 1.024 cm – 0.001 cm = 1.023 cm 1.024 ÷ 0.001 = 1024 10 to 20 10.485 m – 1.024 cm ≈ 10.474 m 10.485 m ÷ 1.024 cm = 1024 20 to 30 10.737 km – 10.485 m ≈ 10.726 km 10.737 km ÷ 10.485 m = 1024 30 to 40 10995 km – 10.737 km ≈ 10984.2 km 10995 km ÷ 10.737 km = 1024 2.2 Exponential Notation and Operations The initial thickness of the paper was 0.001 cm. Upon folding once, its thickness became 0.001 cm × 2 = 0.002 cm. Folding it twice, its thickness became — 0.001 cm × 2 × 2 = 0.004 cm, or 0.001 cm × 22 = 0.004 cm (in shorthand). Upon folding it thrice, its thickness became — 0.001 cm × 2 × 2 × 2, or 0.001 cm × 23 = 0.008 cm. When folded four times, its thickness became — 0.001 cm × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2, or 0.001 cm × 24 = 0.016 cm. Similarly, the expression for the thickness of the paper when folded 7 times will be 0.001 cm × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2, or 0.001 cm × 27 = 0.128 cm.

Estu and Roxie came across a safe containing old stamps and coins that their great-grandfather had collected. It was secured with a 5-digit password. Since nobody knew the password, they had no option except to try every password until it opened. They were unlucky and the lock only opened with the last password, after they had tried all possible combinations. How many passwords did they end up checking? Instead of a 5-digit lock, let us assume we have a 2-digit lock and try to find out how many passwords are possible. There are 10 options for the first digit (0 to 9). For each of these, there are 10 options for the second digit (If 0 is the first digit then 00, 01, 02, 03, …, 09 are possible). Therefore the total number of combinations for a 2-digit lock is 10 × 10 = 100. Now, suppose we have a 3-digit lock. For each of the earlier 100 (2-digit) passwords there are 10 choices for the third digit. So, there are 100 × 10 = 1000 combinations for a 3-digit lock.

(ii) The number of stars in our galaxy is 1,00,00,00,00,000. (iii) The mass of the Earth is 59,76,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,000 kg. As the number of digits increases, it becomes difficult to read the numbers correctly. We may miscount the number of zeroes or place commas incorrectly. We will then read the wrong value. It is like getting ₹5,000 when you were supposed to get ₹50,000. The number of zeroes is more important than the initial digits in several cases. Can we use the exponential notation to simplify and read these very large numbers correctly? For example, the number 5900 can be expressed as — 5900 = 590 × 10 = 590 × 101 = 59 × 100 = 59 × 102 = 5.9 × 1000 = 5.9 × 103 = 0.59 × 10000 = 0.59 × 104. Any number can be written as the product of a number between 1 and 10 and a power of 10. For example, 5900 = 5.9 × 103 20800 = 2.08 × 104 80,00,000 = 8 × 106 Write the large-number facts we read just before in this form. In scientific notation or scientific form (also called standard form), we write numbers as x × 10 y, where x ≥ 1 and x < 10 is the coefficient and y, the exponent, is any integer. Often, the exponent y is more important than the coefficient x. When we write the 2 crore population of Mumbai as 2 × 107, the 7 is more important than the 2. Indeed, if the 2 is changed to 3, the population increases by one-half, i.e., 2 crore to 3 crore, whereas if the 7 is changed to 8, the change in population is 10 times, i.e., 2 crores to 20 crores. Therefore, the standard form explicitly mentions the exponent, which indicates the number of digits. If we say that the population of Kohima is 1,42,395, then it gives the impression that we are quite sure about this number up to the units place. When we use large numbers, in most cases, we are more concerned about how big a quantity or measure is, rather than the exact value.

Last year, we looked at interesting thought experiments in the chapter on Large Numbers. Let us continue this journey. Nanjundappa wants to donate jaggery equal to Roxie’s weight and wheat equal to Estu’s weight. He is wondering how much it would cost. What would be the worth (in rupees) of the donated jaggery? What would be the worth (in rupees) of the donated wheat? In order to find out, let us first describe the relationships among the quantities present. Worth of jaggery (in rupees) = Roxie’s weight in kg × cost of 1 kg jaggery. Worth of wheat (in rupees) = Estu’s weight in kg × cost of 1 kg wheat. Make necessary and reasonable assumptions for the unknowns and find the answers. Remember, Roxie is 13 years old and Estu is 11 years old. Assuming Roxie’s weight to be 45 kg and the cost of 1 kg of jaggery to be ₹70, the worth of donated jaggery is 45 × 70 = ₹3150. Assuming Estu’s weight to be 50 kg and the cost of 1 kg of wheat to be ₹50, the worth of donated wheat is 50 × 50 = ₹2500. Roxie wonders, “Instead of jaggery if we use 1-rupee coins, how many coins are needed to equal my weight?”. How can we find out? For questions like these, you can consider following the steps suggested below. 1. Guessing: Make an instinctive (quick) guess of what the answer could be, without any calculations. The practice of offering goods equal to the weight of a person, called Tulābhāra or Tulābhāram, is quite old and is still followed in many places in Southern India. It is a symbol of bhakti (surrendering oneself), a token of gratitude; it also supports the community."}

Calculating using estimation and approximation — (i) Describe the relationships among the quantities that are needed to find the answer. (ii) Make reasonable assumptions and approximations if the required information is not available. (iii) Compute and find the answer (and check how close your guess was). Would the number of coins be in hundreds, thousands, lakhs, crores, or even more? Make an instinctive guess. Find the answer by making necessary and reasonable assumptions and approximations for the unknowns. Remember, we are not looking for an exact answer but a reasonably close estimate. Estu asks, “What if we use 5-rupee coins or 10-rupee notes instead? How much money could it be?” Make an instinctive guess first. Then find out (make necessary and reasonable assumptions about the unknown details and find the answers). Estu says, “When I become an adult, I would like to donate notebooks worth my weight every year”. Roxie says, “When I grow up, I would like to do annadāna (offering grains or meals) worth my weight every year”. How many people might benefit from each of these offerings in a year? Again, guess first before finding out. Roxie and Estu overheard someone saying — “We did pādayātra for about 400 km to reach this place! We arrived early this morning.” How long ago would they have started their journey? Find answers by making necessary assumptions and approximations. Do guess first before calculating to check how close your guess was! How about measuring to find out the weight of a 1-rupee coin? Initially, your guesses may be very far off from the answer and it is perfectly fine! You will get better at it like as you do it often and in different situations. Guessing and estimating can build intuition about numbers and various quantities. Math Talk Note to the Teacher: Assumptions can vary greatly at times, and as a result the answers computed using these you can also vary. This is perfectly alright. Modelling the situation properly is crucial, which can also be done in different ways sometimes. The accuracy of the assumed numbers or quantities can get better with exposure and practice."}

Linear Growth vs. Exponential Growth Roxie tells Estu about a science-fiction novel she is reading where they build a ladder to reach the moon, “... I wonder if we actually had a ladder like that, how many steps would it have?”. What do you think? Make an instinctive guess first. Would the number of steps be in thousands, lakhs, crores, or even more? To find out, we would need to know the gap between consecutive steps of the ladder. Let’s assume a reasonable distance of 20 cm. Visualising the problem as shown, Pādayātra, is the traditional practice of walking long distances as part of a religious or spiritual pursuit. People across religions in our country observe similar forms of pilgrimage or spiritual walking, although they may have different names or purposes.

He looked at it and smiled. “Around 4000 years ago, there flourished a civilisation in a region called Mesopotamia, in the western part of Asia, containing a major part of the present-day Iraq and a few other neighbouring countries. This is one of the ways they wrote their numbers!” Reema’s eyes lit up, “Seriously? These strange symbols were numbers?” Her curiosity was sparked, and questions started swirling in her head. Since when have humans been counting? What was their need for counting? What were they counting? Since when have people been writing numbers in the modern form?

Get ready to travel back in time with them! Humans had the need to count even as early as the Stone Age. They were counting to determine the quantity of food they had, the number of animals in their livestock, details regarding trades of goods, the number of offerings given in rituals, etc. They also wanted to keep track of the passing days, e.g., to know and predict when important events such as the new moon, full moon, or onset of a season would occur. However, when they said or wrote down such numbers, they didn’t make use of the numbers that we use today. The structure of the modern oral and written numbers that we use today had its origin thousands of years ago in India. Ancient Indian texts, such as the Yajurveda Samhita, mentioned names of numbers based on powers of 10, almost as we say them orally today. For example, they listed names for the numbers one (eka), ten (dasha), hundred (shata), thousand (sahasra), ten thousand (āyuta), etc., all the way up to 1012 and beyond. The way we write our numbers today — using the digits 0 through 9 — also originated and were developed in India, around 2000 years ago. The first known instance of numbers being written using ten digits, including the digit 0 (which was then notated as a dot), occurs in the Bakhshali manuscript (c. 3rd century CE). Aryabhata (c. 499 CE) was the first mathematician to fully explain, and do elaborate scientific computations with the Indian system of 10 symbols. The Indian number system was transmitted to the Arab world by around 800 CE. It was popularised in the Arab world by the great Persian mathematician Al-Khwārizmī (after whom the word ‘algorithm’ is named) through his book On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals (c. 825) and by the noted philosopher Al-Kindi through his work On the Use of the Hindu Numerals (c. 830). From the Arab world, the Hindu numerals were transmitted to Europe and to parts of Africa by around 1100 CE. Though Al-Khwārizmī’s work on calculation with Hindu numerals was translated into Latin, it was the Italian mathematician Fibonacci who around the year 1200 really made the case to Europe to adopt the Indian numerals. However, the Roman numerals were so ingrained in European thinking and writing at the time that the Indian numerals did not gain widespread use for several more centuries. But eventually, during the European Renaissance and by the 17th century, not adopting them became impossible or it would impede scientific progress. Zero in the Bakhshali manuscript"}

Because European scholars learned the Indian numerals from the Arab world, they called them ‛Arabic numerals’ to reflect their European perspective. On the other hand, as noted above, Arab scholars, such as Al-Khwārizmī and Al-Kindi, called them ‛Hindu numerals’. During the period of European colonisation, the European term Arabic numbers became widely used. However, in recent years, this mistake is being corrected in many textbooks and documents around the world, including in Europe.

We will not be looking at different systems in a chronological order, but rather an order that shows us the main stages in the development of the idea of number representation. But first, let us explore some of the foundational ideas needed to count and to determine the number of objects in a given collection. The Mechanism of Counting Imagine that we are living in the Stone Age, say, around ten thousand years ago. Suppose we have a herd of cows. Here are some natural questions that we might ask about our herd — Q1. \u0007How do we ensure that all cows have returned safely after grazing? Q2. Do we have fewer cows than our neighbour? Q3. \u0007If there are fewer, how many more cows would we need so that we have the same number of cows as our neighbour? We need to tackle these questions without the use of the number names or written numbers of the Hindu number system. How do we do it? Here are some possible methods. Method 1: We could tackle the questions by using pebbles, sticks or any object that is available in abundance. Let us choose sticks. For every cow in the herd, we could keep a stick. The final collection of sticks tells us the number of cows, which can be used to check if any cows have gone missing. Math Talk"}

How many numbers can you represent in this way using the sounds of the letters of your language? Method 3: We could use a sequence of written symbols as follows. Do you see a way of extending this method to represent bigger numbers as well? How? From the discussion above, we see that for counting and finding the size of a collection, we need a standard sequence of objects, or names, or written symbols, that has a fixed order. Let us call this standard sequence a number system. A collection of objects can be counted by making a one-to-one mapping between them and the standard sequence, following the sequence order. Since there is no end to numbers, the challenge is to come up with an unending standard sequence/number system that is easy to count with. Using sticks gives an unending standard sequence/number system. However, it is not convenient to count larger collections, as we will need as many sticks as the number of objects being counted. Using the sounds of the letters of a language, as in Method 2, is convenient for the counting process but is not an unending standard sequence/number system. The standard sequence/number system given in Method 3 was actually the system used in Europe before it got replaced by the Hindu number system. It is called the Roman number system. It was widely used in Europe for centuries, and was convenient for many purposes, but had the similar drawback that one cannot write arbitrarily large numbers without introducing more and more symbols.

The symbols occurring in a written number system are called numerals. For example, 0, 1, 5, 36, 193, etc., are some of the numerals occurring in the Hindu number system.

Tally Marks on Bones and Other Surfaces One of the oldest methods of number representation is by making notches — marks cut on a surface such as a bone or a wall of a cave. These marks are also called tally marks. In this method, a mark is made for each object that is being counted. So the final collection of marks represents the total number of objects. This method is very similar to the method of using sticks to count (Method 1), except for the fact that a mark is made instead of adding a stick. Archaeologists have discovered bones dating back more than 20,000 years that seem to have tally marks. The oldest known such bones with markings that are thought to represent numbers are the Ishango bone and the Lebombo bone. The Ishango bone, dating back 20,000 to 35,000 years, was discovered in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It features notches arranged in columns, possibly indicating calendrical systems. The Lebombo bone, discovered in South Africa, is an even older tally stick with 29 notches, estimated to be around 44,000 years old.

Number Names Obtained by Counting in Twos A group of indigenous people in Australia called the Gumulgal had the following words for their numbers. Can you see how their number names are formed? The number name for 3 is composed of number names of 2 and 1. The number name for 4 is composed of two occurrences of the number name for 2. Can you see how the names of the other numbers are formed?

In course of time, their descendants migrated to these places. Even though the number system of Gumulgal had number names for numbers only till 6, we can see the emergence of an idea here. Counting in 2s is more efficient for representing numbers than, for example, a tally system. A general form which this idea has taken in different number systems is as follows: count in groups of a certain number (like 2 in the case of Gumulgal’s system), and use the word or symbol associated with this group size to represent bigger numbers. Some of the commonly used group sizes in different number systems have been 2, 5, 10 and 20. You can find the idea of counting by 5s in the Roman system (Table 1). One of the phenomena that could have led people to this idea might be the human limit for immediately knowing the size of a collection at a glance. Let us try out the following activity. Quickly count the number of objects in each of the following boxes: Up to what group size could you immediately see the number of objects without counting? Most humans find it difficult to count groups having 5 or more objects in a single glance. This limit of perception could have prompted people using tally marks to replace every group of, say, 5 marks, with a new symbol, as seen in the system shown in Table 1. This idea of counting in a certain group size and using it to represent numbers is an important idea in the history of the evolution of number systems. Math Talk"}

How would you represent a number like 1345 in a system that counts only by 5s? Even though counting in groups of a particular size and using it for number representation is more efficient than the tally system, this method can still become cumbersome for larger numbers. The next system shows a refinement of this idea. IV. The Roman Numerals We have already seen the Roman number system till 20 (Table 1). We have seen that it uses I for 1, V for 5, X for 10. To get the Roman numeral for any number till 39, it is first grouped into as many 10s as possible, the remaining is grouped into as many 5s as possible, and finally the remaining is grouped into 1s. Example: Let us take the number 27. 27 = 10 + 10 + 5 + 1 + 1 So, 27 in Roman numerals is XXVII. Instead of representing 50 as XXXXX, a new symbol is given to it: L. Following the way the number 4 is represented as 1 less than 5 — that is, as IV — 40 is represented as 10 less than 50 — that is, as XL. However, people using this system were not always consistent with this practice. Sometimes, 40 was also represented as XXXX. The Roman number system introduces newer symbols to represent certain bigger numbers. Let us call all these numbers that have a new basic symbol as landmark numbers.

It spread throughout Europe with the expansion of the Roman empire. Despite the relative efficiency of the Roman system, it doesn’t lend itself to an easy performance of arithmetic operations, particularly multiplication and division. Example: Try adding the following numbers without converting them to Hindu numerals: (a) CCXXXII + CCCCXIII Let us find the total number of Is, Xs, and Cs, and group them starting from the largest landmark number.

Abacus that Makes Use of the Decimal System In around the 11th century, even the people still using the Roman numerals started using a calculating device — the abacus — constructed using a decimal system. It was a board with lines, as shown in the Fig. 3.1. Starting from the line that stood for 1, each successive line stood for a successive power of 10. Numbers were represented in it as follows: the given number was first grouped into the landmark numbers (powers of 10), in exactly the same way we have been grouping them so far. For each power of 10, as many counters were placed on its line as the number of times it occurred Fig. 3.1: Abacus"}

The presence of a counter above a line contributed a value of 5. For example let us take the number 3426.

To get an idea of how the abacus was used for calculations, let us consider a simple addition problem: 2907 + 43. The two numbers were taken on either side of the vertical partition. How would you use this to find the sum? The counters along each line were brought together. What is to be done if the total in a line exceeded 10? Hint: In this problem, the 7 ones and the 3 ones together make 10 ones which contributes a counter to the line representing 10s. III. Shortcomings of the Egyptian System Despite being a number system that enabled relatively efficient number representations for numbers till a crore (107), and relatively easy computations, the Egyptian system had a drawback. If larger and larger numbers needed to be represented, then there was a need for inventing an unending sequence of symbols for higher and higher powers of 10. Here we see the original challenge of number representation resurfacing in a different form! The next and the final idea in the history of the evolution of number systems not only solves this problem but also remarkably simplifies number representation and computations! Figure it Out 1. Can there be a number whose representation in Egyptian numerals has one of the symbols occurring 10 or more times? Why not? Math Talk"}

Place Value Representation I. The Mesopotamian Number System In the beginning, the number system used in ancient Mesopotamia had different symbols for different landmark numbers. In later times, it became a base-60 system, also called the sexagesimal system, with a very efficient number representation. It has puzzled many why they chose base 60. Different theories exist to explain this, ranging from the connection between 60 and the periods of some important events (like the length of their lunar month which had 30 days, or the time taken for the Sun to complete one revolution around the Earth when Earth is taken to be stationary), the ease of representing fractions (we will not go into this here), their earlier sequence of landmark numbers — 1, 10, 60, 600, 3600, 36000,… — getting reduced to only the powers of 60, and so on. The influence of the Mesopotamian sexagesimal system, also known as the Babylonian number system, can be seen even now in our units of time measurements — 1 hour = 60 minutes and 1 minute = 60 seconds. This system used the symbol for 1 and for 10. Let us now briefly pause on the study of their number system, and ideate on how one can build an efficient number system using the Mesopotamian features seen so far. Math Talk"}

Some scholars suggest that the similarity of symbols given to the landmark numbers 1 and 60 in their earlier number system, and an accidental usage of them, might have made them stumble upon this idea.

Represent the following numbers in the Mesopotamian system — (i) 63 (ii) 132 (iii) 200 (iv) 60 (v) 3605 Thus, we can see how the Mesopotamian system removes the need for generating an unending sequence of symbols for the landmark numbers by making use of the positions where the symbols are written. Such a number system (having a base) that makes use of the position of each symbol in determining the landmark number that it is associated with is called a positional number system or a place value system.

What will be the representation for 3,600? While writing the numerals, the spacing between symbols was not given the way we are giving it here.

Even in our representation which uses uniform spacing between symbols for different powers of 60, it is difficult to know the number of blanks between two sets of symbols, as in the representation of 36002. To address the issue arising out of blank spaces, the later Mesopotamians used a brilliant idea of assigning a ‘placeholder’ symbol to denote a blank space. This is like the 0 (zero) we use in our system. Thus, zero — the symbol that shows nothingness — is indispensable as a placeholder in a place value system in which numbers are written in an unambiguous manner. Even with the problem arising out of blank spaces solved, other ambiguities still remained in the system. For example, the placeholder symbol was primarily used in the middle of numbers and not at the end; so they would not use it to represent a number like (what we would write as) 3600. II. The Mayan Number System In Central America, there flourished a civilisation known as the Mayan civilisation that made great intellectual and cultural progress between the 3rd and 10th centuries CE.

Why was their third landmark number 360 rather than 400? Some scholars feel that this might have something to do with their calendars. They used a dot for 1, and a bar for 5. These were used to denote numbers from 1 to 19. The symbols associated with different landmark numbers were written one below the other with the lowermost set of symbols corresponding to the number of 1s, the set above corresponding to the number of 20s, the set above to the number of 360s and so on. Represent the following numbers using the Mayan system: (i) 77 (ii) 100 (iii) 361 (iv) 721 Because the Mayan system is not an actual base-20 system, it lacks the advantages that a system with a base has for computations.

The Chinese Number System The Chinese used two number systems — a written system for recording quantities, and a system making use of rods for performing computations. The numerals in the rod-based number system are called rod numerals. Here we discuss the rod numerals, which are more efficient in writing and computing with numbers than the written system of the Chinese.

It is for this reason that the Hindu number system is now used throughout the world. The use of 0 as a digit, and indeed as a number, was a breakthrough that truly changed the world of mathematics and science. In Indian mathematics, indeed, zero was not just used as a placeholder in the place value system, but was also given the status of a number in its own right, on par with other numbers. The arithmetic properties of the number 0 (e.g., that 0 plus any number is the same number, and that 0 times any number is zero) were explicitly used by Aryabhata in his Āryabhaṭīya in 499 CE to compute with and do elaborate scientific computations using Hindu numerals. The use of 0 as a number like any other number, on which one can perform the basic arithmetic operations, was codified by Brahmagupta in his work Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta in 628 CE, as we learned in an earlier grade. By introducing 0 as a number, along with the negative numbers, Brahmagupta created what in modern terms is called a ring, i.e., a set of numbers that is closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication (i.e., any two numbers in the set can be added, subtracted, or multiplied to get another number in that set). These new ideas laid the foundations for modern mathematics, and particularly for the areas of algebra and analysis.

This method is actually used in practice to make rectangles. Carpenters in Europe use this method to get a rectangular frame. It is also known that farmers in Mozambique, a country in Africa, use this method while constructing houses to get the base of the house in a rectangular shape. The Process of Finding Properties As we have been seeing from lower grades, properties of geometric objects such as parallel lines, angles, and triangles can be deduced through geometric reasoning. We will continue to deduce properties of special types of quadrilaterals in this chapter. Once you have deduced a property of a quadrilateral, it is good to verify it with a real-world quadrilateral, either the quadrilateral constructed on paper or simply a surface having the shape of the quadrilateral. If you are not able to figure out the property using deduction, you could experiment by taking real-world quadrilaterals and observing the property through measurement. Note that these observations give useful insights about the property, but with them, we can only form a conjecture, that is, a statement about which we are highly confident, but not yet sure if it always holds true. For example, constructing a few rectangles and observing through measurement that their diagonals bisect each other does not necessarily mean that this will always be the case — can we be sure that the 1000th rectangle we construct will also have this property? The only way we can be sure of this property is by justifying or proving the statement, just as we did in Deduction 2.

If you think that this definition is incomplete, try constructing a quadrilateral in which the angles are all 90° but the opposite sides are not equal. Are you able to construct such a quadrilateral? Let us prove why this is impossible. Deduction 4 — What is the shape of a quadrilateral with all the angles equal to 90°? Consider a quadrilateral ABCD with all angles measuring 90°. What can we say about the opposite sides of such a quadrilateral? Join BD. ∆BAD and ∆DCB seem congruent. Can we justify this claim? Two equalities can be directly seen in the triangles. What can we say about ∠1 and ∠2? Recall that we tackled a very similar problem in Deduction 2. We can use the same reasoning here. 1 A B D C 2 Common side Since ∠B = 90°, ∠3 + ∠1 = 90°.

Therefore, AD = CB, and DC = BA, since these are corresponding sides of congruent triangles. Is it wrong to write ∆BAD ≅ ∆CDB? Why? Thus, we have established that if all the angles of a quadrilateral are right angles, then the opposite sides have equal lengths. Therefore, the quadrilateral is a rectangle. Thus, a rectangle can simply be defined as follows — Rectangle: A rectangle is a quadrilateral in which the angles are all 90°. Let us list the properties of a rectangle. Property 1: All the angles of a rectangle are 90°. Property 2: The opposite sides of a rectangle are equal. Are the opposite sides of a rectangle parallel? They definitely seem so. This fact can be justified using one of the transversal properties. Notice that AB acts as a transversal to AD and BC, and that ∠A + ∠B = 90° + 90° = 180°. When the sum of the internal angles on the same side of the transversal is 180°, the lines are parallel. We can use this fact to conclude that the lines AD and BC are parallel, which we represent as AD || BC. Can you similarly show that AB is parallel to DC (AB||DC)?

In the parallelogram ABCD, AB||CD, and AD is a transversal to them. ∠A + ∠D = 180° (sum of the internal angles on the same side of a transversal). Therefore, ∠D = 180 – ∠A = 180 – 30 = 150°. Similarly, AD||BC, and AB and CD are transversals to them. So, ∠A + ∠B = 180°. So, ∠C + ∠D = 180°. Using these equations, we get ∠B = 150° and ∠C = 30°. We see that in this parallelogram, the adjacent pairs of angles add up to 180° and opposite pairs of angles are equal. Thus, ∠A + ∠B = 180°, ∠A + ∠D = 180°, ∠C + ∠D = 180°, and ∠B + ∠C = 180°. And, ∠A = ∠C, and ∠B = ∠D. Since the adjacent angles are the interior angles on the same side of a transversal to a pair of parallel lines, they must add up to 180°. What about the opposite angles? Will they be equal in all parallelograms? If yes, how can we be sure? Let us take one of the angles to be x. What are the other angles? Since ∠P + ∠R = 180°, ∠R = 180 – ∠P = 180 – x. Similarly, since ∠A + ∠R = 180°, ∠A = 180 – ∠R = 180 – (180 – x) = 180 – 180 + x = x. Thus, ∠P = ∠A = x. Similarly, we can deduce that ∠ R = ∠E = 180 – x.

What do you observe about their parities? Repeat this with other sets of 4 numbers. Is there a way to explain why this happens? Hint: \u0007Think of the rules for parity of the sum or difference of two numbers. Explanation 1: Let us consider any of the 8 expressions formed by four numbers a, b, c, and d. When one of its signs is switched, its value always increases or decreases by an even number! Let us see why. Consider one of the expressions: a + b – c – d. Replacing +b by – b, we get a – b – c – d. By how much has the number changed? It has changed by (a + b – c – d) – (a – b – c – d) = a + b – c – d – a + b + c + d (notice how the signs changed when we opened the second set of brackets) = 2b (this is an even number). If the difference between two numbers is even, can they have different parities? No! So either both are even or both are odd. Now, let us see what happens when a negative sign is switched to a positive sign. Replace any negative sign in the expression a + b – c – d with a positive sign and find the difference between the two numbers. What do you conclude from this observation? Starting from any expression, we can get 7 expressions by switching one or more ‘+’ and ‘–’ signs. Thus, all the expressions have the same parity! Explanation 2: We know that odd ± odd = even even ± even = even odd ± even = odd. We have seen that the parity of a + b and a – b is the same, regardless of the parities of a and b. In short, a ± b have the same parity. By the same argument, a ± b + c and a ± b – c have the same parity. Extending this further, we can say that all the expressions a ± b ± c ± d have the same parity. Math Talk"}

Try to think how. The number of ways to choose 4 numbers a, b, c, d and combine them using ‘+’ and ‘–’ signs is infinite. Mathematical reasoning allows us to prove that all the combinations a ± b ± c ± d always have the same parity, without having to go through them one by one. Is the phenomenon of all the expressions having the same parity limited to taking 4 numbers? What do you think? Breaking Even We know how to identify even numbers.

We can justify this in two different ways — • We know 4m is even and 2q is even for any integers m and q. Therefore, their sum will also be even. • The expression 4m + 2q is equal to the expression 2(2m + q). Here, the expression 2(2m + q) means 2 times 2m + q. In other words, 2 is a factor of this expression. Therefore, this expression will always give an even number for any integers m and q. For example, if m = 4 and q = – 9, the expression 4m + 2q becomes 4 × 4 + 2 × (–9) = – 2, which is an even number. In the expression x 2 + 2, x 2 is even if x is even, and x 2 is odd if x is odd.

Let us revisit them. Divisibility by 10, 5, and 2: If the units digit of a number is ‘0’, then it is divisible by 10. Let us understand why this works through algebra. We can write the general form of a number in the Indian system using a set of letter-numbers. For example, a 5-digit number can be expressed as, edcba denoting e × 10000 + d × 1000 + c × 100 + b × 10 + a. The letter-numbers e, d, c, b, and a denote each digit of a 5-digit number. Any number can be written in general as … dcba, where the letter- numbers a, b, c and d represent the units, tens, hundreds and thousands digit, respectively, and so on. As a sum of place values, this number is — … +1000d + 100c + 10b + a. (For example, in the number 4075, d = 4, c = 0, b = 7, and a = 5.) We know that each place value, with the exception of the units place, is a multiple of 10. So, 10b, 100c, … all will be multiples of 10. Hence, the number will be divisible by 10 if and only if the units digit a is 0. Similarly, explain using algebra why the divisibility shortcuts for 5, 2, 4, and 8 work. Let us now examine shortcuts to check divisibility by some other numbers and explain why they work! A Shortcut for Divisibility by 9 Can you say, without actually calculating, which of these numbers are divisible by 9: 999, 909, 900, 90, 990? All of them."}
{"class": "class 8", "subject": "maths", "page_no": 140, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 124 Can we say that any number made up of only the digits ‘0’ and ‘9’, in any order, will always be divisible by 9? Yes, if each digit is either 0 or 9, then each term in its expanded form will be 9 × or 0 × (the ‘ ’ denotes a place value). This means each term will be a multiple of 9, for example, 99009 = 9 × 10000 + 9 × 1000 + 0 × 100 + 0 × 10 + 9 × 1. But this shortcut alone cannot identify all the multiples of 9. Unlike the numbers 2, 5, and 10, we cannot identify the multiples of 9 by just looking at the unit’s digit. 99 and 109 are two numbers with 9 as the units digit; but 99 is divisible by 9, while 109 is not. Is 10 divisible by 9? If not, what is the remainder? Check the divisibility of other multiples of 10 (10, 20, 30, ...) by 9. You will notice that for any multiple of 10, the remainder is the same as the number of tens. Similarly, look at the remainder when the multiples of 100 (100, 200, 300, … ) are divided by 9. What do you notice? The remainder is the same as the number of hundreds for any multiple of 100. Using this observation, find the remainder when 427 is divided by 9. We see that 427 has 4 hundreds; thus, its corresponding remainder (upon division by 9) would be 4. 427 has 2 tens, and its corresponding remainder would be 2. We have 7 units also remaining. Adding all the remainders, we get 4 + 2 + 7 = 13. We can make one more group of 9 with 13, leaving a remainder of 4. Therefore, 427 ÷ 9 gives a remainder of 4. 99 99 1 1 9 1 9 1 9 1 99 1 9 1 9 1 99 1 99 1 99 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 400 20 7 99 1 9 1 9 1 99 1 99 1 99 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 9 (Remainder)"}
{"class": "class 8", "subject": "maths", "page_no": 141, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "Number Play 125 Will this work with bigger numbers? You can see that this is true for any place value: 1 = 0 + 1 10 = 9 + 1 100 = 99 + 1 1000 = 999 + 1 10000 = 9999 + 1, and so on. Each digit thus denotes the remainder when the corresponding place value is divided by 9. For example, to find the remainder of 7309 when divided by 9, we can just add all the digits — 7 + 3 + 0 + 9 — to get 19. This can be seen as follows: 7 × 1000 + 3 × 100 + 0 × 10 + 9 × 1 = 7 × (999 + 1) + 3 × (99 + 1) + 0 × (9 + 1) + 9 × (0+1) = (7 × 999 + 3 × 99 + 0 × 9 + 9 × 0) + (7 × 1 + 3 × 1 + 0 × 1 + 9 × 1) = (7 × 999 + 3 × 99 + 0 × 9 + 9 × 0) + (7 + 3 + 0 + 9). This means that the number 7309 is 19 more than some multiple of 9. The digits 1 and 9 can further be added to get 1 + 9 = 10. Now, we can say that 7309 is 10 more than a multiple of 9. And repeating this step for the number 10, we get the remainder to be 1 + 0 = 1, meaning 7309 is 1 more than a multiple of 9. Therefore, 7309 ÷ 9 gives a remainder of 1. A number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Also, we can add the digits of a number repeatedly till a single digit is obtained. This single digit is the remainder when the number is divided by 9. Look at each of the following statements. Which are correct and why? (i) If a number is divisible by 9, then the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. 9 1 99 1 999 1 9999 1 7 × 1000 3 × 100 9 × 1 999 1 999 1 999 1 999 1 999 1 999 1 999 1 99 1 99 1 99 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 7 × 999 3 × 99 9 3 7 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 99 99 99 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 This is a multiple of 9 So, we need to just consider this part (i.e., 7 + 3 + 9 = 19) This is a multiple of 9 So, we need to just consider this part"}

For example, the number 12 is divisible by both 4 and 6, but not by 24. To check for the divisibility by 24, we can instead check for the divisibility by 3 and divisibility by 8.

What would we get if we had expanded (a + 1) (b + 1) by first taking (b + 1) as a single term? Try it? What happens when one of the numbers in a product is increased by 1 and the other is decreased by 1? Will there be any change in the product? Let us again take the product ab of two numbers a and b.

What happens when a and b are negative integers? Check by substituting different values for a and b in each of the above cases. For example, a = –5, b = 8; a = –4, b = –5; etc. We have seen that integers also satisfy the distributive property, that is, if x, y and z are any three integers, then x (y + z) = xy + xz. Thus, the expressions we have for increase of products hold when the letter-numbers take on negative integer values as well.

Can you see how this identity can be used when one or both numbers are decreased? For example, let us reconsider the case when one number is increased by 1 and the other decreased by 1. Let us write the product (a + 1) (b – 1) as (a + 1) (b + (–1). Taking m = 1 and n = –1 in Identity 1, we have ab + (1) × b + a × (–1) + (1) × (–1) = ab + b – a – 1, which is the same expression that we obtain earlier. Use Identity 1 to find how the product changes when (i) one number is decreased by 2 and the other increased by 3; (ii) both numbers are decreased, one by 3 and the other by 4. Verify the answers by finding the products without converting the subtractions to additions. Generalising this, we can find the product (a + u) (b – v) as follows. (a + u) (b – v) = (a + u) b – (a + u) v = ab + ub – (av + uv) = ab + ub – av – uv. Check that this is the same as taking m = u and n = –v in Identity 1. As in Identity 1, the product (a + u) (b – v) is the sum of the product of each term of a + u (a and u) with each term of b – v (b and (–v)). Notice that the signs of the terms in the products can be determined using the usual rules of integer multiplication. Expand (i) (a – u) (b + v), (ii) (a – u) (b – v). We get (a – u) (b + v) = ab – ub + av – uv, and (a – u) (b – v) = ab – ub – av + uv. The distributive property is not restricted to two terms within a bracket. Example 1: Expand 3a 2 (a – b + 1 5). 3a 2 (a – b + 1 5) = (3a 2 × a) – (3a 2 × b) + (3a 2 × 1 5 ). The terms can be simplified as follows — 3a 2 × a = 3 2 × (a × a).

Can any two terms be added to get a single term? For example, can 3 2 a2 and 3 10 a be added to get a single term? We see that no two terms have exactly the same letter-numbers, which would have allowed them to be simplified into a single term. So, a further simplification of the expression is not possible. Recall that we call terms having the same letter-numbers like terms. Example 2: Expand (a + b) (a + b). We have (a + b) (a + b) = (a+b) a + (a + b)b = a × a + b × a + ab + b × b = a2 + ba + ab + b2 Since ba = ab, we have two terms having the same letter-numbers ab (or, that are like terms), and so can be added — ba + ab = ab + ab = 2ab So we get (a + b) (a + b) = a2 + 2ab + b2. Example 3: Expand (a + b) (a2 + 2ab + b2). (a + b) (a2 + 2ab + b2) = (a + b)a2 + (a + b) × 2ab + (a + b)b2 = (a × a2) + ba2 + (a × 2ab) + (b × 2ab) + ab2 + (b × b2) The terms can be simplified as follows — a × a2 = a3 (why?) ba2 = a2b a × 2ab = 2 × a × a × b = 2a2b b × 2ab = 2 × a × b × b = 2ab2 b × b2 = b3 So, (a + b)(a2 + 2ab + b2) = a3 + a2b + 2a2b + 2ab2 + ab2 + b3.

Similarly, ab2 and 2ab2 are like terms and so can be added — ab2 + 2ab2 = (1 + 2)ab2 = 3ab2. Thus, we have (a + b) × (a2 + 2ab +b2 ) = a3 + 3a2b + 3ab2 + b3. A Pinch of History The distributive property of multiplication over addition was implicit in the calculations of mathematicians in many ancient civilisations, particularly in ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, China, and India. For example, the mathematicians Euclid (in geometric form) and Āryabhaṭa (in algebraic form) used the distributive law in an implicit manner extensively in their mathematical and scientific works. The first explicit statement of the distributive property was given by Brahmagupta in his work Brahmasphuṭasiddhānta (Verse 12.55), who referred to the use of the property for multiplication as khaṇḍa-guṇanam (multiplication by parts). His verse states, “The multiplier is broken up into two or more parts whose sum is equal to it; the multiplicand is then multiplied by each of these and the results added”. That is, if there are two parts, then using letter symbols this is equivalent to the identity (a + b) c = ac + bc. In the next verse (Verse 12.56), Brahmagupta further describes a method for doing fast multiplication using this distributive property, which we explore further in the next section. Figure it Out 1. Observe the multiplication grid below. Each number inside the grid is formed by multiplying two numbers. If the middle number of a 3 × 3 frame is given by the expression pq, as shown in the figure, write the expressions for the other numbers in the grid. x 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 2 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 3 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30 4 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40 5 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 6 6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60 7 7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 70 8 8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72 80 9 9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81 90 10 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 3 × 5 3 × 6 3 × 7 4 × 5 4 × 6 4 × 7 5 × 5 5 × 6 5 × 7 pq"}

Can we use this to find the area of a square of sidelength 65 units? A square of sidelength 65 can be split into 4 regions as shown in the figure — a square of sidelength 60, a square of sidelength 5, and two rectangles of sidelengths 60 and 5. The area of the square of sidelength 65 is the sum of the areas of all its constituent parts. Can you find the areas of the four parts in the figure above?

We can say that the ratio of width to height of image A is 60 : 40. The numbers 60 and 40 are called the terms of the ratio.\u0007 The ratio of width to height of image C is 30 : 20, and that of image D is 90 : 60. In a ratio of the form a : b, we can say that for every ‘a’ units of the first quantity, there are ‘b’ units of the second quantity. So, in image A, we can say that for every 60 mm of width, there are 40 mm of height. We can say that the ratios of width to height of images A, C, and D are proportional because the terms of these ratios change by the same factor. Let us see how. Image A — 60 : 40 Multiplying both the terms by 1 2, we get 60 × 1 2 : 40 × 1 2 which is 30 : 20, the ratio of width to height in image C. By what factor should we multiply the ratio 60 : 40 (image A) to get 90 : 60 (image D)? A more systematic way to compare whether the ratios are proportional is to reduce them to their simplest form and see if these simplest forms are the same. 7.3 Ratios in their Simplest Form We can reduce ratios to their simplest form by dividing the terms by their HCF. In image A, the terms are 60 and 40. What is the HCF of 60 and 40? It is 20. Dividing the terms by 20, we get the ratio of image A to be 3 : 2 in its simplest form. The ratio of image D is 90 : 60. Dividing both terms by 30 (HCF of 90 and 60), we get the simplest form to be 3 : 2. So the ratios of images A and D are proportional as well. What is the simplest form of the ratios of images B and E? The ratio of image B is 40 : 20; in its simplest form, it is 2 : 1. The ratio of image E is 60 : 60; in its simplest form, it is 1 : 1."}

So, we can say that the ratios of width to height of images B and E are not proportional to the ratios of images A, C, and D. When two ratios are the same in their simplest forms, we say that the ratios are in proportion, or that the ratios are proportional. We use the ‘::’ symbol to indicate that they are proportional. So a : b :: c : d indicates that the ratios a : b and c : d are proportional. Thus, 60 : 40 :: 30 : 20 and 60 : 40 :: 90 : 60. 7.4 Problem Solving with Proportional Reasoning Example 1: Are the ratios 3 : 4 and 72 : 96 proportional? 3 : 4 is already in its simplest form. To find the simplest form of 72 : 96, we need to divide both terms by their HCF. What is the HCF of 72 and 96? The HCF of 72 and 96 is 24. Dividing both terms by 24, we get 3 : 4. Since both ratios in their simplest form are the same, they are proportional. Example 2: Kesang wanted to make lemonade for a celebration. She made 6 glasses of lemonade in a vessel and added 10 spoons of sugar to the drink. Her father expected more people to join the celebration. So he asked her to make 18 more glasses of lemonade. To make the lemonade with the same sweetness, how many spoons of sugar should she add? To maintain the same sweetness, the ratio of the number of glasses of lemonade to the number of spoons of sugar should be proportional. For 6 glasses of lemonade, she added 10 spoons of sugar. The ratio of glasses of lemonade to spoons of sugar is 6 : 10. If she needs to make 18 more glasses of lemonade, how many spoons of sugar should she use? We can model this problem as — 6 : 10 :: 18 : ? We know that each term in the ratio must change by the same factor, for the ratios to be proportional. How can we find the factor of change in the ratio? The first term has increased from 6 to 18. To find the factor of change, we can divide 18 by 6 to get 3."}

Example 3: Nitin and Hari were constructing a compound wall around their house. Nitin was building the longer side, 60 ft in length, and Hari was building the shorter side, 40 ft in length. Nitin used 3 bags of cement but Hari used only 2 bags of cement. Nitin was worried that the wall Hari built would not be as strong as the wall he built because she used less cement. Is Nitin correct in his thinking? In Nitin and Hari’s case, we should compare the ratio of the length of the wall to the bags of cement used by each of them and see whether they are proportional. The ratio in Nitin’s case is 60 : 3, i.e., 20 : 1 (in its simplest form). The ratio in Hari’s case is 40 : 2, i.e., 20 : 1 (in its simplest form). Since both ratios are proportional, the walls are equally strong. Nitin should not worry! Example 4: In my school, there are 5 teachers and 170 students.

What is the ratio of Neelima’s age to her mother’s age? What would be the ratio of their ages when Neelima is 12 years old? Would it remain the same? The ratio of Neelima’s age to her mother’s age when Neelima is 3 years old is 3 : 30 (her mother’s age is 10 times Neelima’s age). In the simplest form, it is 1 : 10. When Neelima is 12 years old (i.e., 9 years later), the ratio of their ages will be 12 : 39 (9 years later, her mother would be 39 years old). In the simplest form, it is 4 : 13. When we add (or subtract) the same number from the terms of a ratio, the ratio changes and is not necessarily proportional to the original ratio. Example 7: Fill in the missing numbers for the following ratios that are proportional to 14 : 21. ______ : 42 6 : ______ 2 : ______ In the first ratio, we don’t know the first term. But the second term is 42. It is 2 times the second term of the ratio 14 : 21. So, the first term should also be 2 times 14 (the first term). Hence the proportional ratio is 28 : 42. For the second ratio, the first term is 6. What factor should we multiply 14 by to get 6? Can it be an integer? Or should it be a fraction? We can model this as 14y = 6. So, y = 6 14 = 3 7. So, we need to multiply 21 (the second term of 14 : 21) also by the same factor 3 7. 21 × 3 7 is 9. So, the ratio is 6 : 9. In the third ratio, the first term is 2. We can see that when we divide 14 (the first term of 14 : 21) by 7 (HCF of 14 and 21) we get 2. If we divide 21 also by 7, we get 3. So, the ratio is 2 : 3. Filter Coffee!

To solve such problems, we can model two proportional ratios using algebraic notation as — a : b :: c : d. For these two ratios to be proportional, we know that term c should be a multiple of term a by a factor, say f, and term d should be a multiple of term b by the same factor f. So, c = f a ...(1) d = f b ...(2) From (1) and (2), we can say that, f = c a and f = d b . Therefore, c a = d b. Multiplying both sides by ab, we get, ab × c a = ab × d b ab × c a = ab × d b bc = ad or ad = bc Thus, when a : b :: c : d, then ad = bc. This is known as cross multiplication of terms. Since ad = bc, we can show that d = bc a . Two ratios are proportional if their terms are equal when cross multiplied. The fourth unknown quantity can be found through such cross multiplication. In ancient India, Āryabhaṭa (199 CE) and others called such problems of proportionality Rule of Three problems. There were 3 numbers given — the pramāṇa (measure — ‘a’ in our case), the phala (fruit — ‘b’ in our case), and the ichchhā (requisition — ‘c’ in our case). To find the ichchhāphala (yield — ‘d’ in our case), Āryabhaṭa says, “Multiply the phala by the ichchhā and divide the resulting product by the pramāṇa.” In other words, Āryabhaṭa says, “pramāṇa : phala :: ichchhā : ichchhāphala,” therefore, pramāṇa × ichchhāphala = phala × ichchhā."}

If it continues at the same speed, the ratio of the time taken should be proportional to the ratio of the distance covered. 150 : 90 :: 4 : ? Is this the right way to formulate the question? No, because 150 is in minutes, but 4 is in hours. The second ratio should use the same units for time as the first ratio. Since 4 hours is 240 minutes, the right form is 150 : 90 :: 240 : ? How can you find the distance covered in 240 minutes? Discuss with your classmates and find the answer using different strategies. We can model this proportion as 150 : 90 :: 240 : x.

What is the weight to price ratio of the Meghalaya tea? Is it 1 : 800? This would not be appropriate, because we considered the weight in grams in the case of Himachal. So, the weight to price ratio is 1000 : 800 in Meghalaya after we convert the weight to grams. To check if the ratios are proportional, we need to see if both ratios are the same in their simplest forms. The Himachal tea ratio in its simplest form is 1 : 1. The Meghalaya tea ratio in its simplest form is 5 : 4. So, the ratios are not proportional. Which tea is more expensive? Why? To answer the question as to which tea is more expensive, we should compare the price of tea for the same weight in both places. What is the price of 1 kg of tea from Meghalaya? It is ₹800. In Himachal, if 200 g of tea costs rupees 200, what is the cost of 1 kg of tea? Let us say that the price of 1 kg of tea is x rupees. 200 g is 1 5 of 1 kg. So, 1 5 × x = 200. Multiplying both sides by 5, we get 1 5 × x × 5 = 200 × 5 1 5 × x × 5 = 1000 x = 1000. So, the cost of 1 kg of tea is ₹800 in Meghalaya and ₹1,000 in Himachal Pradesh.

Multiplying the number of groups by the size of each group, your partner gets 24 counters and you get 18 counters, when you share 42 counters in the ratio of 4 : 3. 12 3 1 : : 9 3 Sharing 12 in the ratio 3 : 1 The ‛whole’ is 12 The ‛whole’ is 4 (= 3 + 1) and 12 is 3 times 4 The ‛parts’ are 3 times the ratio 3 : 1 × 3 × 3"}

We need to split x into groups such that it can be divided into two parts where the first part has m groups and the second part has n groups. 2. But what is the size of each group? This can be found out by dividing x by the number of groups. The number of groups are m + n. So, the size of each group is x m + n . 3. So, the first part has m × x m + n objects and the second part has n × x m + n objects. Thus, if we want to divide a quantity x in the ratio of m: n, then the parts will be m × x m + n and n × x m + n. We see that m × x m + n : n × x m + n :: m : n. Example 11: Prashanti and Bhuvan started a food cart business near their school. Prashanti invested ₹75,000 and Bhuvan invested ₹25,000. At the end of the first month, they gained a profit of ₹4,000. They decided that they would share the profit in the same ratio as that of their investment. What is each person’s share of the profit? The ratio of their investment is 75000 : 25000. Reducing this ratio to its simplest form, we get 3 : 1. 3 + 1 is 4 and dividing the profit of 4000 by 4, we get 1000. So, Prashanti’s share is 3 × 1000 and Bhuvan’s share is 1 × 1000. \u0007So, Prashanti would get ₹3,000 and Bhuvan would get ₹1,000 of the profit. Example 12: A mixture of 40 kg contains sand and cement in the ratio of 3 : 1. How much cement should be added to the mixture to make the ratio of sand to cement 5 : 2? × 6 × 6 42 4 3 : : 24 18 Sharing 42 in the ratio 4 : 3 The ‛whole’ is 42 The ‛whole’ is 7 (= 4 + 3) and 42 is 6 times 7 The ‛parts’ are 6 times the ratio 4 : 3"}
{"class": "class 8", "subject": "maths", "page_no": 191, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "Proportional Reasoning-1 175 Let us find the quantity of sand and cement in the original mixture. The ratio is 3 : 1 and the total weight is 40 kg. So, the weight of sand is 3 (3 + 1) × 40 = 30 kg. The weight of cement is 1 (3 + 1) × 40 = 10 kg. The weight of sand is the same in the new mixture. It remains 30. But the new ratio of sand to cement is 5 : 2. So the question is, 5 : 2 :: 30 : ? If the ratio is 5 : 2, then the second term is 2 5 times the first term. Since the new ratio is equivalent to 5 : 2, the second term in the new ratio should also be 2 5 times of 30. 2 5 × 30 = 12. The new mixture should have 12 kg of cement if the ratio of sand to cement is to be 5 : 2. There is 10 kg of cement already. So, we need to add 2 kg of cement to the original mixture.
