{"class": "class 8", "subject": "eng", "page_no": 3, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "FOREWORD The National Education Policy 2020 envisages a system of education in the country that is rooted in Indian ethos and its civilisational accomplishments in all domains of human endeavour and knowledge, while at the same time preparing students to constructively engage with the prospects and challenges of the twenty-first century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured students’ inherent abilities, touching upon all the five planes of human existence, the pañchakośas in the Foundational and the Preparatory Stages have paved the way for the progression of their learning further at the Middle Stage. Thus, the Middle Stage acts as a bridge between the Preparatory and the Secondary Stages, spanning three years from Grade 6 to Grade 8. The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow as they advance in lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects in three languages—including at least two languages native to India—Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy—a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. Poorvi, the English language textbook for Grade 8 is one of these. Its content comprises stories, poems, and narratives that ensure a reflection of their social, cultural, and geographical landscapes wherein students are sure to find traces of their lived experiences."}
{"class": "class 8", "subject": "eng", "page_no": 4, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "iv Poorvi also weaves into its contents snippets from the vast treasure-trove of Indian Knowledge Systems, India’s artistic and cultural heritage, and embeds values alongside ecological sensitivity, gender equality, digital skills, etc. For all practical purposes, it has, to my mind, succeeded in its Curricular Goals: first, to foster natural curiosity among students through a proper selection of content, and second, develop among them the core competencies in listening, speaking, reading, and writing by intelligently designing various activities around them, thereby seamlessly integrating vocabulary and grammar within meaningful contexts. However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook, and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years.

{"class": "class 8", "subject": "eng", "page_no": 5, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "Poorvi, textbook of English for Grade 8, has been developed in alignment with the vision of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023. Language education is essential for effective communication, aesthetic expression, and appreciation. Reasoning and critical thinking are closely linked with language use, and these are valuable capacities to be developed. Language development plays an important role in the development of perceptual and practical concepts, and also enables us to check our experiences with others to ensure that we have a shared meaning emerging from these experiences. The textual material developed for the Middle Stage will take children well beyond the Preparatory Stage. Curricular Goals, competencies, and learning outcomes have been the guiding principles in developing the textbook. The Curricular Goals (CG) cover a range of competencies. The NCF-SE 2023 has stated the following Curricular Goals: CG-1: Develops independent reading, comprehension, and summarising skills of a variety of texts (stories, poems, extracts of plays, essays, articles, and news reports). CG-2: Attains the ability to write about thoughts, feelings, and experiences of social events. CG-3: Develops the capacity for effective communication using language skills for questioning, describing, analysing, and responding. CG-4: Explores different literary devices and forms of literature. CG-5: Develops the ability to recognise basic linguistic aspects (word and sentence structure) and use them in oral and written expression. CG-6: Develops an appreciation of the distinctive features of the language, including its alphabet and script, sounds, rhymes, puns, and other wordplays and games unique to the language (pp. 245–246). The Curricular Goals have been covered through a variety of themes and an array of activities. There are five thematic units that comprise stories, poems, conversations, and narrative and descriptive pieces. Themes, such as wit and wisdom, values and dispositions, mystery and magic, environment, and science and curiosity have been included. Cross-cutting themes, such as Indian Knowledge Systems, values, heritage, gender sensitivity, and inclusion have been integrated into all the units. Each unit has three literary pieces―story, poem, and conversation, or non-fictional writing. There are in-text questions, ‘Let us discuss’ to assess comprehension of the text. The end-of-the-text questions given in ‘Let us think and reflect’ are designed to encourage critical thinking, reasoning, responding, analysing, and more. ABOUT THE BOOK"}
{"class": "class 8", "subject": "eng", "page_no": 6, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "vi Unit 1—‘Wit and Wisdom’ celebrates intelligence, humour, and critical thinking. ‘The Wit that Won Hearts’ introduces students to the kingdom of Krishnadeva Raya and legendary courtier Tenali Rama known for his wit and problem-solving skills. The poem, ‘A Concrete Example’ by Reginald Arkell highlights irony and satire in everyday situations. A rock garden may be a thing of beauty for someone, and it may not catch the attention of someone else. The play, ‘Wisdom Paves the Way’ presents a thought-provoking scenario where different perspectives lead to unique solutions. It appreciates the role of wisdom, reasoning, and critical thinking in resolving conflicts. Unit 2—‘Values and Dispositions’ emphasises that true strength lies in courage, kindness, and responsibility. ‘A Tale of Valour: Major Somnath Sharma and The Battle of Badgam’ teaches students the values of courage, duty, and patriotism, showing how selflessness and commitment to one’s country can make a lasting impact. The poem, ‘Somebody’s Mother’ by Mary Dow Brine, focuses on values of kindness, empathy, and the importance of helping others. It teaches that small acts of kindness can bring great comfort to those in need. ‘Verghese Kurien – I Too Had a Dream’ encourages young people to not only pursue personal success but also contribute to the greater good of the society, reinforcing the value of serving one’s community with honesty and perseverance. Unit 3—‘Mystery and Magic’ highlights the power of intelligence, the wonders of creativity and the breathtaking marvels of nature. ‘The Case of the Fifth Word’ by Donald J. Sobol emphasises that keen attention to detail and critical thinking can help uncover hidden truths and solve mysteries. The poem, ‘The Magic Brush of Dreams’, revolves around creativity, kindness, and the power of art. The poem teaches that talent should be used for good, emphasising generosity and the impact of imagination in shaping the world. ‘Spectacular Wonders’, explores India’s unique and mysterious natural wonders, highlighting the enigmatic charm that each place unfolds. Unit 4—‘Environment’ encourages students to nurture a bond with nature and express gratitude for the bountiful gifts it offers. ‘The Cherry Tree’ by Ruskin Bond is a story that emphasises the importance of nurturing and the rewards of perseverance. It also teaches us to appreciate the small miracles of life and value our deep connection with nature. The poem, ‘Harvest Hymn’ by Sarojini Naidu, reflects the hardwork of farmers and their deep faith in the land and the divine forces. It signifies the harmony between humans and nature, portraying the harvest as a sacred and joyous occasion. ‘Waiting for the Rain’, by Kamakshi Balasubramanian, is a story that captures the vagaries of nature, and its impact on farming. It also highlights the wisdom in understanding the natural cycle of renewal and balance."}
{"class": "class 8", "subject": "eng", "page_no": 7, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "vii Unit 5—‘Science and Curiosity’ sparks curiosity about the wonders of science, technology, and discovery. ‘Feathered Friend’ by Arthur C. Clarke explores companionship beyond human relationships through the story of a bird in space. The poem, ‘Magnifying Glass’ by Walter de la Mare, encourages students to explore perception and mystery. ‘Bibha Chowdhuri: The Beam of Light that Lit the Path for Women in Indian Science’ highlights renowned scientists and their contributions, promoting discussions on scientific advancements. These literary pieces serve not only as sources of entertainment but also as repositories of valuable life lessons, fostering personal growth, and equipping children with skills to navigate social situations with confidence. By resonating with children’s daily experiences, the selected pieces promote positive values such as resilience, empathy, and emotional intelligence, thereby exerting a profound impact on their overall development. The primary focus lies in cultivating competencies in listening, speaking, reading, and writing while concurrently developing vocabulary and grammar in context. Language learning truly comes to life when connected to the immediate environment of learners, allowing them to express their thoughts, feelings, and experiences through experiential learning. All the activities are conveniently colour coded under headings, such as ‘Let us discuss’, ‘Let us think and reflect’, ‘Let us learn’, ‘Let us listen’, ‘Let us speak’, ‘Let us write’, and ‘Let us explore’. ‘Let us Explore’ extends learning beyond the text, staying within the unit’s theme. It aims to connect students with the Indian Knowledge System, fostering an appreciation for our rich heritage and culture, encouraging students to delve deeper, engage in meaningful discussions, and broaden their understanding. In-text activities and exercises at the end of each chapter are thoughtfully designed to be engaging, fostering joyful learning experiences while serving as tools for assessment and learning. Illustrations have been carefully crafted to depict the relevant context and enhance comprehension. We sincerely hope that students will enjoy doing these activities, and develop language competencies.

Poorvi The textbook of English for Grade 8 is titled Poorvi after the Indian rāga ‘Poorvi’. This rāga is said to promote harmony and serenity. It is associated with dusk, specifically sunset time (Sandhi Prakash). Each rāga in Indian music carries its own emotional significance and is symbolically connected to certain seasons, times of day, and moods. Rāgas are believed to evoke specific emotions in listeners. Poorvi is an ancient and traditional Hindustani classical rāga that originated in eastern India. It is typically performed during the fourth prahar of the day, between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. It evokes a sense of calmness and contemplation in the journey of learners, symbolising a harmonious blend of traditional and modern learning."}

Tenali Ramakrishna, in particular, was known for his quick wit and humour, earning him a special place in the king’s court as both a poet and a witty advisor. His clever solutions to seemingly insurmountable problems made him a beloved figure in the empire’s history. Even the wisest rulers face moments of disharmony, and at one such time, the king had a quarrel with his queen, Thirumalambal, over a seemingly trivial matter. For weeks, he did not utter a single word to her, and in his frustration, stopped visiting her altogether. His absence cast a shadow over the palace, and the once cheerful corridors seemed quiet and forlorn. Thirumalambal, distraught and upset, tried her best to resolve the issue but failed. With no other alternative, she insurmountable: undefeatable trivial: unimportant forlorn: lonely distraught: upset decided to seek the help of Tenali Rama, the court’s brilliant and witty poet.

One by one, the ministers rose to present their ideas. Some suggested expanding irrigation networks, while others advocated for better manure. Amid these suggestions, Tenali Rama stood quietly at the edge of the court, observing everyone with an amused smile. Finally, the king called upon Rama. The chatter in the court died down as all eyes turned to him. Rama approached the throne, carrying a plateful of paddy seeds. Bowing low, he began, “Your Majesty, I bring you a revolutionary type of paddy seeds. If these are sown, the yield will be three times greater than the current results.” A murmur swept through the room. One of the courtiers, known for his sarcasm, whispered just loud enough to be heard, “I wonder if these are magic seeds!

Rama glanced around the court, his sharp gaze meeting the sceptical eyes of the courtiers. “If one were to sow seeds without proper care, no one would reap a good harvest,” he said, pausing for effect. “And what if the person had a habit of yawning while sowing? Wouldn’t the seeds scatter unevenly?” The court erupted into laughter, the earlier sarcasm replaced by genuine amusement. Even the king, caught off guard, sighed and instinctively yawned. Rama watched him keenly, then continued, “Your Majesty, is there anyone in this world who does not yawn? It is as natural as breathing.” The king’s expression shifted as realisation dawned. His mind raced back to the quarrel with the queen. He remembered scolding her harshly for yawning while he recited his poem. He realised how unfair he had been. “If I had known that yawning was not a sign of disrespect, I wouldn’t have taken her gesture so personally,” he thought, regret filling his heart."}

A Lesson in Responsibility One bright Monday morning, I woke up to the sounds of birds chirping loudly. For once, I wasn’t late for school. My uniform was neatly laid out, and my homework was already packed in my bag. I felt proud of myself for being so organised. But little did I know, the day would still teach me an important lesson. During the morning assembly, our teacher, Mrs. Rao, announced a surprise Science quiz. My heart skipped a beat. I had studied the chapter a week ago, but I had forgotten to revise it over the weekend. As I sat at my desk with the question paper in front of me, I froze. The questions looked familiar, yet I couldn’t recall the answers clearly. I tried my best to focus, but it wasn’t enough. Later, when the results were announced, I scored much lower than I expected. Disappointed, I spoke to Mrs. Rao after the class. She smiled and said, “It’s not about how much you know but how consistently you prepare. Small efforts add up every day.” Her words stayed with me. From that day on, I made it a habit to revise my lessons regularly, even if there wasn’t an immediate test. Responsibility isn’t just about being on time or finishing tasks—it’s about being ready for what’s unexpected.

One might swoon Drunken with beauty then, or gaze and gaze On a primeval Eden, in amaze.

As you listen, fill in the blanks for the following sentences given below by selecting the correct options. Hello everybody! Today I’ll be narrating a story about a quick-witted courtier in the kingdom of Vijayanagara. A renowned scholar, proud of his abilities, once visited the kingdom of Vijayanagara. You see, he wanted to challenge the scholarsinthecourtofKingKrishnadevaRaya.Thecourtscholars did not want to accept the challenge as they were worried of being defeated by the visitor. Besides this, they were also afraid that the king would be angry if they refused to face the scholar. They knew that only the quick-witted Tenali Rama would be able to manage the situation. So, naturally, they asked him for a solution. As expected, Rama told them that he would accept the challenge. The next day, Rama arrived at the palace. Rama and the challenger sat facing each other. There was a bundle wrapped in silk kept near Rama. He placed his hand on the bundle and said to the visitor, “Let us start by discussing the merits of tila-kashta-mahisha-bandhana”. The visitor was taken aback. He had read thousands of works. But he had never heard of this work. He had no idea what to say. The scholar had to accept his defeat. Ashamed, he quietly left the palace. Now, the king was curious to know about the great work Rama had mentioned. Rama smiled and removed the silk cloth. There was a huge bundle of sticks tied with a thick rope! The king was puzzled and asked for an explanation. Rama told him, “O king! til is sesame; kashta is stick, tilakashta means sticks of sesame plants”. Then, displaying the rope Rama said, “This is the rope used to tie a buffalo—mahisha means buffalo, bandhana means the rope used for tying—so, this is tila-kashta-mahisha-bandhana.”"}

Hello everyone! The Rock Garden is a spacious open-air exhibition. It is a proof of human creativity with waste materials. This garden was created by Nek Chand, in 1957. This is the reason the garden is also known as Nek Chand’s Rock Garden. The garden was featured on an Indian postage stamp in 1983 and Nek Chand was awarded the Padma Shri a year later. The Rock Garden is spread across a massive 40-acre wonderland. Do you know why I say this? Well, it is because it has several colourful sculptures and mosaic of art pieces. What is unique about the Rock Garden is that it is divided into three distinct phases. Each area reveals a unique collection of installations including terracotta pots, light fixtures, and even broken toilet pots, that have been transformed into extraordinary masterpieces.

This is the story of Major Somnath Sharma and the brave men that he led on a mission to protect the Srinagar airport from falling into the hands of a guerrilla force trained and backed by Pakistan. This is a story of how 90 men managed to foil the plan of some 500 infiltrators who wanted to capture Srinagar and the Kashmir Valley and deliver a blow to newly-independent India. The events that led to the Battle of Badgam started in August 1947, when Pakistan launched Operation Gulmarg to annex the Kashmir Valley. This was in violation of an existing agreement with Hari Singh, the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, who had committed Pakistan not to attack the state.

If they had succeeded, it would have allowed them to control strategic mountain passes, peaks, and rivers. On 22 October, Operation Gulmarg was launched and these infiltrators invaded Kashmir, which led to the Princely State becoming a part of India on 26 October 1947. In response to this invasion, the Government of India sent its troops to defend the people of Kashmir and India’s borders on 27 October 1947. A contingent of troops posted to Jammu and Kashmir was airlifted into Srinagar because the land route through Pathankot was not in a good condition. On 31 October, the D Company of the 4th Battalion of Kumaon Regiment, under the command of Major Somnath Sharma, was also flown into Srinagar. At that time, Major Somnath Sharma’s left hand was in plaster, but he insisted on being with his company while in combat. He knew that this mission would be very challenging and told his senior officers, “I know my men better than anyone else, and if they are going into action, they are not going in without me.” These words highlighted his commitment to his men and his country. Before their arrival in Srinagar, there had been unfounded rumours of tribal movement towards the village of Badgam, less than 5 kilometres away from the Srinagar airport. The village was on a higher altitude than the airfield, and access was through the village. Hence, it was important for Indian forces to retain control of the area in order to protect troops and facilitate supplies arriving via air. In reality, the enemy had started arriving in Badgam in small groups to avoid detection. On 03 November 1947, several companies, including Major Somnath Sharma’s D Company, were sent to patrol and assess emerging threats in and around the village. Throughout the day, the valley was eerily silent. Around afternoon, the companies were ordered to return one by one. D company with 90 soldiers was the last, and they were expected to return by 2:00 p.m. When the enemy (tribal guerrilla invaders), under the command of the Pakistani army, saw that only a small group combat: a battle unfounded: not based on reason or facts eerily: in a strange, frightening and mysterious way"}

Shortly thereafter, a major attack came from another side. By then, Major Somnath Sharma and his 90 soldiers were facing about 500 invaders. The Pakistani invaders sought to capture the Srinagar airfield and its surrounding areas. It was clear to Major Somnath Sharma that defending Srinagar town, the airfield, and the wider valley was indeed difficult until reinforcements arrived. After assessing the situation, he requested air strikes. He bravely laid out ground panels to guide the aircraft towards their target. The aerial attacks were successful in hitting the tribal invaders, but they still outnumbered D Company by almost seven to one, the attack on the positions occupied by Major Somnath’s men continued.

We are heavily outnumbered. We are under devastating fire. I shall not withdraw an inch but will fight to the last man and the last round”. Just a few minutes later, when he was crouched in a trench next to a machine gun operator, in order to help him load the gun, his position was hit by a mortar shell, killing him instantly. Despite losing their Major and faced with the overwhelming numerical superiority of the enemy, the heroic actions of late Major Somnath Sharma motivated his men to hold on to their position for over six more hours before being overrun by the enemy. Their brave resistance provided time for reinforcements to arrive, including flying in soldiers from the Punjab regiment to Srinagar. The heroic deeds of Major Somnath and his men thoroughly demotivated the enemy, causing more than 300 casualties, including injuring their leader. In many significant ways, D Company’s sacrifice and Major Somnath’s leadership saved Srinagar for India. The 4 KUMAON battalion was awarded the Battle Honour, Srinagar. Major Somnath laid down his life for the nation at the young age of 24. For this act of conspicuous bravery, Major Somnath Sharma was awarded the Param Vir Chakra (PVC).

I have trouble even remembering! In today’s fast-paced world we have become so addicted to instant communication that we prefer to use a telephone. But speaking on the telephone only gives us an immediate but fleeting joy. Writing is different. Writing— even if it is a letter—not only conveys our present concerns and views of the events taking place around us but it becomes a possession that can be treasured and re-read over the years, with great, abiding pleasure. You may not wish to read it all right away but, perhaps, a couple of decades or more from now, you will pick up these jottings of mine again and they will give you a deeper understanding of what I have done, and the reasons I pursued a life of service to our nation’s farmers. You will then discover in them a valuable reminder of the days just before the world entered the twenty-first century. And you may want to share my memories with those of your generation, or even younger, to provide a glimpse of the world your grandparents lived in and knew. I started my working life soon after our country became independent. The noblest task in those days was to contribute in whatever way we could towards building an India of our dreams—a nation where our people would not only hold their heads high in freedom but would be free from hunger and poverty. A nation where our people could live with equal respect and love for one another. A nation that would eventually be counted among the foremost nations of the world. It was then that I realised, in humility, that choosing to lead one kind of life means putting aside the desire to pursue other options. This transformation took place within me fifty years ago, when I agreed to work for a small cooperative of dairy farmers who were trying to gain control over their lives. To be quite honest, service to our nation’s farmers was not the career I had envisioned for myself. But somehow, a series of events swept me along and put me in a certain time with a choice that would transform my life. I could have pursued a career in metallurgy and become the"}

Or, opted for a commission in the Indian Army and maybe retired as a general. Or, I could have left for the US and gone on to become a highly successful NRI. Yet, I chose none of these because somewhere, deep down, I knew I could make a more meaningful contribution by working here in Anand, Gujarat. Your grandmother too made an important choice. She knew, in those days, life in Anand could not offer even the simple comforts that we take for granted today. However, she ardently supported my choice to live and work in Anand. That choice of your grandmother to stand by me has given me an everlasting strength, always ensuring that I shouldered my responsibilities with poise. Whenever I have received any recognition for my contributions towards the progress of our country, I always emphasised that it is a recognition of the achievements of many people with whom I had a privilege to be associated with. I would like to stress even more strongly that my contributions have been possible only because I have consistently adhered to certain values. Values that I have inherited from my parents and other family elders; values that I saw in my mentor and supporter here in Anand—Tribhuvandas Patel. I have often spoken of integrity as the most important of these values, realising that integrity—and personal integrity, at that—is being honest to yourself. If you are always honest to yourself, it does not take much effort in always being honest with others. I have also learnt what I am sure you, too, will find out some day. Life is a privilege and to waste it would be wrong. In living this privilege called ‘life’, you must accept responsibility for yourself, always use your talents to the best of your ability and contribute somehow to the common good. That common good will present itself to you in many forms every day. If you look around you, you will find there is a lot waiting to be done: your friend may need some help, your teacher could be looking for a volunteer, or the community you live in will need you to make a contribution. I hope that you, too, will discover, as I did, that failure is not about not succeeding. Rather, it is about not putting in your best effort and not contributing, however modestly, to the common good. In life you, too, will discover as I did, that anything can go wrong at any time and mostly does. Yet, there is little correlation between the circumstances of people’s lives and how happy they are. Most of us compare ourselves with someone we think is happier—a relative, an acquaintance, or often, someone we barely know. But when we start looking closely we realise that what we saw were only images of perfection. And that will help us understand and cherish what we have, rather than what we don’t have."}

The highlighted punctuation is a long dash that can be used to link words or numbers or to create a pause in a sentence. There are two main types: the shorter en dash (–) and the longer em dash (—). The en dash (–) represents a span or range in numbers or dates. For example, it can indicate time periods, like ‘train operates June– September’ or page numbers, such as ‘refer to pages 50–75’ or to show scores, ‘India won the series 2–1’. The em dash (—) is used to add extra information or to show a change in thought within a sentence. For example, ‘The exhibition—held in the main hall—features local artists.’ Or ‘I bumped into someone unexpected—my old teacher.’ Note: Do not add spaces around the dash and avoid overusing them. Read the sentences below and insert either an em dash (—) or an en dash (–) suitably. (i) The conference will be held from March 15 March 20. (ii) I have lived in Kanpur Raipur for five years now.

Financial literacy is an essential lifelong skill that should be taught to children from an early age. Preparing children with financial literacy skills is an investment for their future well-being. By imparting an understanding of money, saving, budgeting, and wise spending, we empower them to navigate the financial world with confidence as they grow up. Whether it is managing a cooperative society, a start-up, or a household budget, financial literacy is an ongoing learning process that evolves as children grow and their understanding deepens. An introduction to concepts of saving, budgeting, investing, and responsible spending equips them with essential life skills. Children learn best through practical examples. Real-life situations help them understand the value of money and the importance of making wise financial choices. Thinking critically before spending helps cultivate responsible habits. The concept of saving and investing can be explained through relatable examples, such as planting seeds that grow into trees bearing fruit. As children grow older, they will learn to differentiate between needs and wants, compare prices before making a purchase and understand importance of financial literacy. Discuss in groups. 1. The importance of learning about money and saving from a young age. Share one example of it. 2. Imagine you received some money as a gift. How would you decide whether to save it, spend it, or invest it? What factors would you consider? 3. If you were in charge of planning a small event at school with a limited budget, how would you manage the money? 4. Why is financial literacy important for everyone?"}

The medal was instituted as a Gallantry Medal with retrospective effect from 15 August 1947 by Dr. Rajendra Prasad, the then President of India. The medal was designed by Mrs. Savitri Khanolkar, who drew inspiration from Sage Dadhichi, a Vedic rishi, who made the ultimate sacrifice by giving up his body so that the gods could create a deadly weapon called Vajra, or Thunderbolt, from his spine. The Param Vir Chakra is cast in bronze. At its centre, on a raised circle, is the State Emblem of India. Surrounding it are four replicas of Indra’s Vajra, lined with lotus flowers.

On a fateful morning in Rajouri, young Rohan Ramchandra Bahir, a 15-year-old student, became a local hero when he fearlessly saved the life of a woman who had fallen into the Domri River while washing clothes. The 43-year-old woman was struggling to stay afloat in the strong currents, when Rohan, without a moment’s hesitation, leapt into the river, putting his own life at risk. With great determination and courage, Rohan managed to reach the woman and pull her to safety, despite the dangerous conditions of the river. Onlookers who witnessed the incident were in awe of the young boy’s bravery. Rohan’s selfless act did not go unnoticed.

Evelyn Glennie’s loss of hearing had been gradual. By the time she was 11 her performance in school had deteriorated and her headmistress urged her parents to take her to a specialist. It was then discovered that her hearing was severely impaired as a result of gradual nerve damage. “Everything suddenly looked black,” says Evelyn. But Evelyn was not going to give up. She was determined to lead a normal life and pursue her interest in music. One day she noticed a girl playing a xylophone and decided that she wanted to play it too. Most of the teachers discouraged her but percussionist Ron Forbes spotted her potential. He began by tuning two large drums to different notes. “Don’t listen through your ears,” he would say, “try to sense it some other way.” Says Evelyn, “Suddenly I realised I could feel the higher drum from the waist up and the lower one from the waist down.” Forbes repeated the exercise, and soon Evelyn discovered that she could sense certain notes in different parts of her body. “I had learnt to open my mind and body to sounds and vibrations.” She explains, “It pours in through every part of my body. It tingles in the skin, my cheekbones and even in my hair.” The rest was sheer determination and hard work. She never looked back from that point onwards. And she got right to the top, the world’s most sought-after multi percussionist with a mastery of some thousand instruments."}

THE VALLEY OF FLOWERS, UTTARAKHAND The Valley of Flowers is an eye- catching spectacle with around 600 species of exotic flowers, including orchids, poppies, primulas, marigold, daisies, and anemones. It is a place where nature blooms in its full glory offering an attractive view. The trek to the valley offers spectacular views of beautiful waterfalls and wild streams. The valley is also home to rare wildlife species like the grey langur, flying squirrel, red fox, lime butterfly, and snow leopard, to name a few. With a stunning backdrop of the mighty Himalayan ranges, the Valley of Flowers National Park presents an unforgettable experience for visitors. Spread over a huge area in the Chamoli district, the Valley of Flowers National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Between the months of May and October, this area turns into a botanical wonderland! 2. THE LIVING ROOT BRIDGES, MEGHALAYA Imagine building a bridge without the use of cement, stones, concrete, etc. Is it possible? The living root bridges are incredible feats of engineering built by the indigenous people of Meghalaya.

THE LONAR CRATER LAKE, MAHARASHTRA The Lonar Crater Lake is a geological wonder, nestled in the town of Lonar in Buldhana district, Maharashtra. It is believed to have been formed thousands of years ago. This ancient landform, consisting of a giant hole, came into existence when a colossal meteorite, blazing at an extremely high speed, crashed into the Earth, leaving behind a stunning mark. It is the only crater in India formed in basaltic rock by a meteorite impact and ranks as the third largest in the world, placing it among the top five largest craters globally. The crater’s perfectly circular depression cradles a unique saline lake at its core, creating a striking visual contrast against the surrounding rugged terrain. This site is a rare and extraordinary blend of celestial impact and terrestrial beauty. The rim of the meteor crater offers a breath-taking spectacle of nature’s power and the enduring allure of our planet’s ancient past."}

MAGNETIC HILLS IN LEH DISTRICT, LADAKH In the travels around Leh-Ladakh, is a fascinating sight which arouses curiosity to no end—the Magnetic Hill, a place where gravity takes a backseat! Lying at a distance of around 30 km from Leh, the Magnetic Hill is marked by a yellow signboard which reads ‘The Phenomenon That Defies Gravity’. It also instructs visitors to park vehicles in the box marked with a white point on the road, which is known as the Magnetic Road. When the vehicles are parked at the indicated spot, they begin moving forward at a speed of almost 20km/h. This unusual place creates an optical illusion where vehicles appear to roll uphill, a sight that has left tourists in disbelief for years, caused by the peculiar alignment of surrounding slopes and the horizon line. 5. GLOWING WATERS OF KERALA Situated 15 kms from Kerala’s Kochi town, Kumbalangi is a beautiful village with vast green vegetation. In the serene backwaters of Kumbalangi village, one can see magically glowing waters in the night. This phenomenon is called bioluminescence, and is caused by a high concentration of micro-planktons in the sea, which are small organisms found in marine and freshwater. This beautiful sight has captured the attention of locals as well as tourists, making Kumbalangi an eco-tourism village in India.

Yes, they are called mangrove forests, where trees take root under water in the low-oxygen soil. The roots slow down the movement of tidal waters, stabilising the coastline and reducing erosion. The Sundarbans is one such mangrove forest spread over 1,400 kms in West Bengal, lying in the delta of rivers, such as the Ganga, the Brahmaputra, and the Meghna. The name is derived from sundari trees that are plentiful in the area. The area is also populated by an extensive range of flora and fauna, including many bird species, the majestic Bengal tiger, and other threatened species, such as the estuarine crocodile and the Indian python. 7.

As you listen, mark true or false for the statements 1–4. Hello everyone! In today’s episode, we’ll be discussing some simple but effective ways to improve our observation skills. Being observant isn’t just about seeing, it’s about truly noticing details in the world around us. Whether it’s in daily life or in the workplace, observation skills can help us become more aware, make better decisions, and even improve memory. Let’s get started! First, slow down and take your time. Rushing through tasks often leads to missed details. When you take time to focus on what’s in front of you, you’re more likely to notice features you might otherwise overlook. When you pause and observe, the details become clearer. Anothereffectivemethodistoengageallyoursenses.Observation isn’t just about seeing; it’s also about hearing, smelling, touching, and even tasting. The more senses you engage, the more information you absorb. For example, when you’re in a new environment, don’t just look around—pay attention to sounds, smells, and textures too. A third tip is to ask questions. Curious people tend to be better observers because they actively try to understand what they’re noticing. Asking questions about what you see, like “Why is this here?” or “What purpose does it serve?” forces your brain to think critically about what you’re observing. Next, take notes or make sketches. Writing down what you observe can help reinforce details in your memory. Even quick sketches of an object or place can strengthen your understanding of its features. TRANSCRIPTS"}

But on the more sheltered slopes there were forests of oak and deodar. Rakesh lived with his grandfather on the outskirts of Mussoorie, just where the forest began. His father and mother lived in a small village fifty miles away, where they grew maize and rice and barley in narrow terraced fields on the lower slopes of the mountain. But there were no schools in the village, and Rakesh’s parents were keen that he should go to school. As soon as he was of school-going age, they sent him to stay with his grandfather in Mussoorie. He had a little cottage outside the town. Rakesh was on his way home from school when he bought the cherries. He paid fifty paise for the bunch. It took him about half-an-hour to walk home, and by the time he reached the cottage there were only three cherries left. ‘Have a cherry, Grandfather,’ he said, as soon as he saw his grandfather in the garden.

He pressed the seed into the soil with his thumb and it went right in. Then he had his lunch, and ran off to play cricket with his friends, and forgot all about the cherry seed.

Early in the morning, when he got up to chop wood and light a fire, Rakesh saw the V-shaped formation streaming northward, the calls of the birds carrying clearly through the thin mountain air. One morning in the garden he bent to pick up what he thought was a small twig and found to his surprise that it was well rooted.

One day he found a bright green praying-mantis perched on a branch, peering at him with bulging eyes. Rakesh let it remain there; it was the cherry tree’s first visitor. The next visitor was a hairy caterpillar, who started making a meal of the leaves. Rakesh removed it quickly and dropped it on a heap of dry leaves. ‘Come back when you’re a butterfly,’ he said. Winter came early. The cherry tree bent low with the weight of snow. Field-mice sought shelter in the roof of the cottage.

But the tree kept blossoming right through the spring, and there were always more blossoms than birds. That summer there were small cherries on the tree. Rakesh tasted one and spat it out. ‘It’s too sour,’ he said. ‘They’ll be better next year,’ said Grandfather. But the birds liked them—especially the bigger birds, such as the bulbuls and scarlet minivets—and they flitted in and out of the foliage, feasting on the cherries. On a warm sunny afternoon, when even the bees looked sleepy, Rakesh was looking for Grandfather without finding him in any of his favourite places around the house. Then he looked out of the bedroom window and saw Grandfather reclining on a cane chair under the cherry tree. ‘There’s just the right amount of shade here,’ said Grandfather. ‘And I like looking at the leaves.’ ‘They’re pretty leaves,’ said Rakesh. ‘And they are always ready to dance, if there’s a breeze.’ After Grandfather had come indoors, Rakesh went into the garden and lay down on the grass beneath the tree.

II Find out from your Vocational Education teacher about Agriculture as a vocation and other related vocations, such as horticulture, etc. III India’s rich tradition of meteorological knowledge includes indigenous forecasting systems, grounded in ancient wisdom. These provide sophisticated methods for predicting climate, calculating rainfall, and issuing early warnings. References to rain and weather are found in numerous ancient texts, including the Rigveda, Shrimad Bhagavad, Parashara Samhita, Panini’s Ashtadhyayi, and Meghmala. These texts offer insights into rainfall patterns and seasonal changes. IV Meteorological Services for Agriculture in India 200 The primary objective of the Agricultural Meteorology Division, India Meteorological Department (IMD) is to minimise the impact of adverse weather on crops and to leverage crop-weather relationships to boost agricultural production.

As you listen, number the events in the correct order in which they happen. Hello everyone! Did you know that rice is actually a type of grass, and the part we eat is its seed? Let me tell you about the process of cultivating rice. It all starts with preparing the land. First, the soil has to be ploughed. Rice is typically grown in fertile soil that holds a lot of water. The most important step in preparing the soil is to soak it with plenty of water. This step is called puddling. Once the nursery bed is prepared, the seeds can be planted. After that, we sow the seeds on the soil’s surface. Paddy farmers have to ensure that their fields stay flooded with water because irrigation is crucial. It takes around 4 to 5 weeks for the seeds to grow into seedlings. After this comes the most important step—transplanting. The seedlings that were prepared in the nursery bed are uprooted and then transplanted into the flooded field. In around 120 days, the rice plants are fully grown. At this point, the crops are harvested by cutting them. Following this, the seeds are separated from the plant. This is called threshing. To reduce the moisture content even more, the separated grains are dried. This ensures that they can be stored or processed further. Through a process called milling, the rice is separated from the outer covering on it. Finally, the rice reaches the market, and that’s where we get it to make all kinds of delicious foods. Whether it’s Appam, Pulao, Khichdi, or Daal Bhaat, rice is a big part of many meals. II Now listen to the talk again. As you listen, choose the correct option to answer the questions that follow."}

No one ever thought it was necessary—and even had such a rule existed, I am quite certain that Sven Olsen would have ignored it. Actually he was a wiry little fellow, like most of the early spacers, and managed to qualify easily for the 150-pound bonus that kept so many of us on a reducing diet. Had he been built otherwise, his chances of getting a job in space would have been very slim. Sven was one of our best construction men, and excelled at the tricky and specialised work of collecting assorted girders as they floated around in free fall, making them do the slow-motion, three-dimensional ballet that would get them into their right positions, and fusing the pieces together when they were precisely dovetailed into the intended pattern: it was a skilled and difficult job, for a space suit is not the most convenient of garbs in which to work. However, Sven’s team had one great advantage over the construction groups you see putting up skyscrapers down on Earth. They could step back and admire their handiwork without being abruptly parted from it by gravity. Don’t ask me why Sven wanted a pet, or why he chose the one he did. I’m not a psychologist, but I must admit that his wiry: thin but strong assorted: consisting of various types mixed together girders: long, thick piece of steel or concrete that supports a large structure precisely: exactly dovetailed: fitted together garbs: clothing of a special kind handiwork: creation abruptly: unexpectedly/ suddenly"}

Claribel weighed practically nothing, her food requirements were tiny—and she was not worried, as most animals would have been, by the absence of gravity. I first became aware that Claribel was aboard when I was sitting in the little cubbyhole laughingly called my office, checking through my lists of technical stores to decide what items we’d be running out of next. When I heard the musical whistle beside my ear, I assumed that it had come over the station intercom, and waited for an announcement to follow. It didn’t; instead, there was a long and involved pattern of melody that made me look up with such a start that I forgot all about the angle beam just behind my head. When the stars had ceased to explode before my eyes, I had my first view of Claribel. She was a small yellow canary, hanging in the air as motionless as a hummingbird—and with much less effort, for her wings were quietly folded along her sides. We stared at each other for a minute; then, before I had quite recovered my wits, she did a curious kind of backward loop I’m sure no earthbound canary had ever managed, and departed with a few leisurely flicks. It was quite obvious that she’d already learned how to operate in the absence of gravity, and did not believe in doing unnecessary work. Sven didn’t confess to her ownership for several days, and by that time it no longer mattered, because Claribel was a general pet. He had smuggled her up on the last ferry from Earth, when he came back from leave—partly, he claimed, out of sheer scientific curiosity. He wanted to see just how a bird would operate when it had no weight but could still use its wings. Claribel thrived and grew fat. On the whole, we had little trouble concealing our guest when VIPs from Earth came visiting. A space station has more hiding places than you can count; the only problem was that Claribel got rather noisy when she was upset, and we sometimes had to think fast to explain the curious peeps and whistles that came from ventilating shafts and storage bulkheads. There were a couple of narrow escapes—but then who would dream of looking for a canary in a space station? aboard: on an aircraft cubbyhole: a small enclosed space or room ceased: stopped canary: a popular bird which people love to keep as pets; found in open areas with small trees and shrubs wits: ability to think quickly flicks: sudden, quick movements concealing: hiding ventilating shafts: passageways or ducts that allow fresh air in a closed space bulkheads: dividing walls or barriers between separate compartments in an aircraft"}

She usually wakes him up.” Before I could retort that she usually woke me up, too, Sven came in through the doorway, and we could see at once that something was wrong. He slowly opened his hand, and there lay a tiny bundle of yellow feathers, with two clenched claws sticking pathetically up into the air. “What happened?” we asked, all equally distressed. “I don’t know,” said Sven mournfully. “I just found her like this.” “Let’s have a look at her,” said Jock Duncan, our cook-doctor-dietitian. We all waited in hushed silence while he held Claribel against his ear in an attempt to detect any heartbeat. Presently he shook his head. “I can’t hear anything, but that doesn’t prove she’s dead. I’ve never listened to a canary’s heart,” he added rather apologetically. “Give her a shot of oxygen,” suggested somebody, pointing to the green-banded emergency cylinder in its recess beside the door. Everyone agreed that this was an excellent idea, and Claribel was tucked snugly into a face mask that was large enough to serve as a complete oxygen tent for her. To our delighted surprise, she revived at once. Beaming broadly, Sven removed the mask, and she hopped onto his finger. She gave her series of “Come to the cookhouse, boys” trills—then promptly keeled over again. “I don’t get it,” lamented Sven. “What’s wrong with her? She’s never done this before.” For the last few minutes, something had been tugging at my memory. My mind seemed to be very sluggish that morning, as if I was still unable to cast off the burden of sleep. I felt that I could do with some of that oxygen—but before I could reach the mask, understanding exploded in my brain.

Read how they manage the routine tasks in the absence of gravity. You may find out more information about it from the internet. 1. Write: Astronauts use a special Space Pen which has a cartridge with ink combined with resin. The ink remains solid until friction with the ball at the point of the pen liquefies it. It works in all positions, in extreme heat and cold, and in atmospheres ranging from pure oxygen to vacuum. 2. Exercise: Astronauts use resistance exercise equipment. Weight training is done by applying a load using vacuum cylinders. Running on the treadmill is made possible with the bodies held down using rubber straps. 3. Eat: Astronauts eat preserved foods which is dried, canned, vacuum-packed, and frozen. These can be prepared by adding cold or hot water, and some can be heated in an oven. They also eat ready-to-eat items, such as nuts, breads, and fruits. 4. Sleep: Astronauts can sleep on a floor, wall, or ceiling as there’s no distinction between up and down but they may gradually float away while sleeping. Therefore, they need to restrain their bodies in small sleeping compartments or sleeping bags. III Did you know that animals can save humans from natural calamities? Animals can sense natural calamities. Read the following examples and decide if this is true. • In 2004, before a tsunami could hit the coastline of Indonesia, some animals made efforts to flee—elephants ran for higher ground, flamingos abandoned low-lying nesting areas, and dogs refused to go outdoors. • Minutes before the Naples quake of 1805, oxen, sheep, dogs, and geese started making alarm calls in unison. • Migratory birds crossing the Pacific are able to dodge storms and other hazards. • In the Gulf of Mexico, sharks sense the drop in barometric pressure that precedes hurricanes and tend to swim to deeper waters as a result. Dolphins have also been observed swimming away from storm-prone areas. Scientists have studied this behaviour and found that when severe stresses arise in deep rock before the earthquake, ultra-low frequency electromagnetic waves are generated that animals can sense.

Today, the women behind ISRO’s Mars Orbiter Mission and Chandrayaan-3 are celebrated for their brilliance and achievements. However, the foundation was laid by early pioneers like Bibha Chowdhuri—India’s first woman physicist—who carved a path in the male-dominated field of physics. At a time when Indian women struggled to seek knowledge and equitable access to education, Bibha Chowdhuri emerged as a rare beam of light—a woman who defied the odds and lit a path for others to follow. Born in 1913 in Kolkata, in an India that still followed the traditional path. Bibha’s story was anything but ordinary. She was a scientist who rose not only against the societal expectations of women but also amidst the towering giants of science—men whose names the world would come to celebrate, while hers was whispered only in the halls of those who recognised her brilliance. Bibha’s persistence eventually earned her a place at the Bose Institute. She had already begun to chip away at the walls of exclusion, becoming the first Indian woman to excel in high-energy particle physics. Breaking Boundaries In 1945, Bibha’s academic journey took her to the University of Manchester. Under the guidance of the celebrated Nobel Laureate, Patrick M.S. Blackett, she delved deeper into the field of cosmic rays. Her Ph.D. thesis on cosmic rays earned local recognition, with newspapers introducing her as ‘India’s k"}

This title reflected the awe she inspired in a world still sceptical of her capabilities. In an era marked by towering scientific discoveries, Bibha was often on the cusp of greatness but remained in the shadows of her male counterparts. Her most notable contribution was the discovery of pi-mesons, a subatomic particle. Her nomination for a Nobel Prize in 1950 by Erwin Schrödinger, though unsuccessful, reflected her remarkable talent. Her life, full of challenges and struggles, was marked by an uphill battle to be heard and seen in the field of science. Chowdhuri never received any awards during her lifetime, but continued her work tirelessly. In 1949, upon her return to India, she became the first woman faculty member at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), personally selected by Homi J. Bhabha. Chowdhuri’s contributions spanned across research institutes like the Physical Research Laboratory in Ahmedabad and the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics in Kolkata. This is where she continued her work on cosmic rays and subatomic particles. Through decades of crucial research, from Kolar Gold Mines to the Physical Research Laboratory under the mentorship of Vikram Sarabhai, Bibha’s work went on quietly, as she remained in the periphery of Indian scientific acclaim. She passed away in 1991, her story untold, her name largely forgotten. The Legacy of Bibha Chowdhuri and Today’s Women in Indian Science The stars are not meant to remain hidden forever. In 2019, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) honoured her legacy by renaming a star in the constellation Leo—HD 86081—as ‘Bibha,’ meaning ‘beam of light.’ Fittingly, she is now a ‘star in heaven,’ a symbol of the light she brought to Indian science.

Let us know more about them. • Augmented reality (AR) enhances a person’s environment by adding digital elements to what can be seen in real time, usually through a smartphone camera. • Virtual reality (VR) offers a fully immersive experience, replacing the real world with a simulated one. • Through AR and VR, the students can see and interact with things that they could not interact with in real life. This enables younger students to understand difficult ideas easily. • To keep up with the times, NCERT has developed the e-Pathshala AR (Augmented Reality) App under the aegis of MHRD, Government of India. • This App aims to enable students to go beyond textbooks and four walls of the classrooms and learn concepts by directly experimenting rather than only through reading and memorisation. • This revolutionary effort will change most students from passive listeners to active learners. • This effort is in line with the Prime Minister’s Digital India vision to empower varied sectors using technology and addressing the triple need of skill, scale, and speed.

Daughter : Papa, everyone talks about how yoga and the concept of zero came from India, but I recently found out there are so many more inventions that people don’t really know about! Father : Oh really? Like what? Daughter : Well, did you know that radio broadcasting has roots in India? We usually credit Marconi, but Jagadish Chandra Bose, a Bengali scientist, actually conducted an experiment using microwaves before Marconi. Father : Wow, I didn’t know that! That’s incredible. I can recollect something about fibre optics. Daughter : Yes! You’re absolutely right Papa. Can you imagine life without fibre optics? No fast internet, no clear communication… And guess what? It was pioneered by Narinder Kapany, an Indian physicist from Punjab. He’s called the ‘father of fibre optics.’ Father : That’s something I use every day, but I just had an idea that the origins were in India. What about fun things? Any of those that you’ve found out about? Daughter : Yes indeed! You’ll love this one—Snakes and Ladders! It was actually invented as a game to teach children values, with ladders representing virtues and snakes representing evil. It wasn’t just a board game like we think today. It had a spiritual meaning in ancient times."}
