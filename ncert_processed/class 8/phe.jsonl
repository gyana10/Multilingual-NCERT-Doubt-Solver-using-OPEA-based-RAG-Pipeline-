{"class": "class 8", "subject": "phe", "page_no": 3, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "The National Education Policy 2020 envisages a system of education in the country that is rooted in Indian ethos and its civilisational accomplishments in all domains of human endeavour and knowledge, while at the same time preparing students to constructively engage with the prospects and challenges of the twenty-first century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured students’ inherent abilities, touching upon all the five planes of human existence, the pañchakośas in the Foundational and the Preparatory Stages have paved the way for the progression of their learning further at the Middle Stage. Thus, the Middle Stage acts as a bridge between the Preparatory and the Secondary Stages, spanning three years from Grade 6 to Grade 8. The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow as they advance in lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects in three languages—including at least two languages native to India— Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy—a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. Foreword"}

Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. The book for Physical education and well- being, titled Khel Yatra for Grade 8, is meticulously designed to develop motor skills and engage children in the team sports of Athletics, Table Tennis and Volleyball. Age-specific aspects of Yoga are designed to lay the foundation for healthy living. The textbook aligns with the competencies included in the NCF-SE 2023 for this stage. Khel Yatra emphasises the importance of physical activity and the values and dispositions essential for life. It incorporates cross-cutting themes, such as inclusion, gender equality, and cultural rootedness. The content and activities are designed to encourage peer group learning, and enrich the educational experience for both students and teachers. While this textbook is valuable, children should also explore interesting local games and play with friends. This book is not only useful for school learning, but is a valuable resource for parents and community. However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook, and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years.

{"class": "class 8", "subject": "phe", "page_no": 5, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "About the Book The National Curriculum Framework for School Education 2023 (NCF-SE 2023) recognises the criticality of the health and wellbeing of individuals as a key factor for success in all aspects of life. Considering the focus on holistic well-being, NCF-SE has mandated Physical Education and Well-being as a core curricular area for all stages of school education. To help the teachers and students achieve curricular goals of Physical Education and Well-being, for the first time a textbook has been designed for Grade 8. This book enables students to experience the joy of playing, explore diverse physical activities, practice fitness skills, learn basic sports skills, and immerse in the world of yoga. Sports and physical activities teach important motor skills, socio-emotional awareness and regulation, associated cognitive abilities, as well as the values of self-discipline, hard work, teamwork, and a gracious acceptance of one’s strengths and vulnerabilities. To achieve the goals of fitness, sports and holistic well-being, the Grade 8 textbook is designed to have the following six units. 1. Foundations of Physical Education and Well-being 2. Physical and Motor Fitness 3. Fundamental Skills of Athletics 4. Fundamental Skills of Table Tennis 5. Fundamental Skills of Volleyball 6. Yoga In Unit 1, students explore the connection between physical education (PE) and well-being, emphasising its impact on personal and social behaviour. Through playing games and engaging in discussions, students will understand the importance of living a healthy lifestyle;"}

Students will also learn about the safety measures to minimise the risk of injuries and create a healthy environment for the students. In Unit 2, students learn different fitness components like endurance, strength, flexibility, and balance. The main aim is to understand how each of these components contributes to overall health. Units 3, 4 and 5 focus on learning new games. Athletics is introduced in Unit 3, Table Tennis in Unit 4 and Volleyball in Unit 5. Through interactive sessions and group exercises, students will discover the excitement of sports and health advantages of physical activities. The emphasis will be on inclusivity, team cohesion, and enjoyment of movement. In the last unit, that is, Unit 6 students immerse in the holistic nature of yoga. They learn about Yama (social discipline) and Niyama (Personal discipline) to inculcate healthy habits for positive behavior. Systematic practice of various yogāsanas starting with Sūkṣhma Vyāyāma (loosening exercises), preparatory breathing practices and step-by-step performance of each āsana helps our body to be flexible, strong, balanced and disease free. Various techniques of Prāṇāyāma strengthen the lungs, improve functioning of major systems of our body, calm down the mind, improve concentration and help in achieving overall harmony and well-being. To explore the world within us and experience deep sense of peace, tranquility and bliss, students learn different techniques of Dhāraṇā (single pointed concentration) and Dhyāna (meditation). Learning various yogic practices lays the foundation for a long and healthy life. In this book, apart from learning the games and physical activities, students will learn to follow rules, understand the importance of safe practices and fair play, work harmoniously in groups, treat each other with courtesy and respect, as well as, help each other, and experience the joy of playing together. Inculcation of these values and dispositions will partly happen while children are engaged in the physical activities or games and partly, they will be reinforced"}

Sufficient time must be given for circle time during the Physical Education and Well-being periods. Structure and Flow of Classes Refer to the previous class’ textbook for suggestive session plan. As per NCF-SE 2023 recommendations 90 hours are allocated to physical education and well-being. So, 115 –120 periods of 40 minutes each for activities and classes along with 15-20 periods for formative and summative assessment have been allocated. Principals and physical education teachers have the liberty to plan classes keeping in mind equal emphasis and distribution of all units. Since assessment depicting progression in the motor fitness, sport-specific skills, yoga and psychosocial domain, session-ending assessment procedure will remain the same as formative assessment. Suggestive timetable assumes at least 5 periods of 40 minute each, per week. NCF-SE recommends allocating block period (2 periods together) for physical education and well-being. If it is not possible to allocate two block periods and one single period every week, it is necessary to design single periods with different focus to ensure sufficient time for activities, game and circle time. Suggestions are given below for two different scenarios of timetable. • Scenario 1 – Five single periods per week. • Scenario 2 – Two block periods for Units 1 to 5 and single period for yoga. Scenario 1: Three different types of sessions have been visualised to effectively use the limited time in each period and achieve the learning outcomes. • Type 1: Maximises game practice. • Type 2: Maximises circle time after play to provide sufficient time for discussing cognitive and socio-emotional aspects. • Type 3: Maximises gamified drills to focus on one specific skill.

Physical education teachers may assist in development characteristics like willpower, determination, resoluteness, self-discipline, team spirit, and awareness to succeed by observing how athletes behave throughout practice and competition. Running Running is a method of terrestrial locomotion by which humans and other animals move quickly on foot. Running is an aerial gait in which the feet are above the ground. Running is one of the most essential athletic skills, requiring proper technique, speed, endurance, and coordination. Techniques to Start the Race There are two types of starts: 1. Crouch start or Sitting start: This is used for all running events up to 400-metre. It allows the runner to react to the sound and start the race as fast as possible by properly positioning their centre of gravity in the ‘set’ position. In a short-distance race, the outcome is decided by a quick start and an increased acceleration capacity. Modern starting techniques use three different types of starting positions, which are outlined below: (a) Bunch or Bullet start (b) Medium start (c) Elongated start 2. Standing start: This type of start is commonly used in middle- distance and long-distance races. The athlete begins in an upright position, with one foot slightly ahead of the other, and starts running smoothly when the race begins. This start allows for better pacing and control over longer distances. In this Grade you will only learn about Crouch or Sitting Start."}

It requires power, coordination, and technique. From a technical perspective, jumping events vary in complexity, ranging from the simple Long Jump to the High Jump and Triple Jump, with the Pole Vault appearing more intricate. The primary objective in these events is to achieve the greatest possible height or distance. In the Triple Jump, athletes aim to maximise the total distance of three successive jumps, while in the Pole Vault, they utilise a pole to assist in clearing greater heights. The key components of jumping are: 1. Approach run • A controlled run to generate momentum. • Athletes must maintain speed and balance before take- off. 2. Take-off • The athlete pushes off from the ground using one or both legs. • Proper body alignment is essential for maximising height and distance. 3. Flight phase • The body remains in motion after take-off. • Proper posture and leg movement are crucial to maintaining balance. 4.

It teaches us how to cultivate a natural balance among the body, mind and emotions. This inner harmony is inspired by nature’s perfect balance, just as it harmonises day and night or the changing seasons. The Bhagavad Gita defines yoga as “samatvam yoga uchyate (2.48)”, meaning “Yoga is a state of balance.” The key to achieving this state is to focus on the present moment, and enjoying what is happening right now rather than dwelling on the past or anticipating the future. This practice naturally reduces stress and brings freedom from desires. Furthermore, it helps us mindfully connect with the world while teaching us to be kind, compassionate, and understanding towards others’ feelings. Let us now turn our attention to the yoga practices that further deepen our connection to the present moment. Do you remember those amazing yoga poses we learnt in Grade 7, like the graceful Marjariāsana and the energising Sūrya Namaskāra? We explored the concept of Pancha Kośha to gain a deeper understanding of the different layers of the self. We even mastered some challenging poses like the Utakatāsana, Sarvāgāsana, Danurāsana, and the Matsyāsana. We also learnt to regulate our breath with Bhastrika Prāṇāyāma and discovered the benefits of Hasta Mudrā. Now, let us continue this fascinating journey by deepening our understanding, and learning a few more practices. In this grade, we will explore how yoga can support us, particularly as we navigate changes and learn to manage our emotions.

Over time, various masters documented their techniques and experiences in ancient yoga texts. These texts are more than just books; they are treasure chests holding the profound wisdom of yoga masters. This wisdom passed down through generations, illuminates the path of yoga, offering guidance on ethical living, physical postures, breath regulation, and mental discipline. Some of the most important yoga texts are as follows: • Patañjali Yoga Sutra: Maharishi Patañjali’s Yoga Sutra is the initial systematic text of yoga sādhana. It has four pāda (chapters), and contains 195 short, concise, and powerful statements that guide us on the path of yoga. These sutras teach us various important concepts, such as Ashtānga Yoga. • Haṭha Pradīpikā: This text discusses the practical aspects of yoga and is divided into 4 chapters. Swami Svātmārāma is the author of this text. It explains how to practise āsanas, Ṣhaṭkarma (six cleansing techniques), Prāṇāyāma, mudrā, Bandha (neuromuscular or energy locks—muscle contractions that facilitate energy flow) and Samādhi. • Gheranḍa Samhitā: The Gheranḍa Samhitā, written by Rishi Gheranḍa, is a practical guide to yoga comprising seven chapters. It teaches Saptānga Yoga, a step-by-step method that begins with body exercises and leads to inner understanding. It talks about Ṣhaṭkarma, āsana, mudrā, Pratyāhāra, Prāṇāyāma, Dhyāna and Samādhi.

Yamas are universal guidelines for being good that everyone, everywhere, at any time, should try to follow, regardless of their religion or region. Yama’s principles help us become good citizens who care for others. Patañjali's Yoga Sutras explain these disciplines as follows: अहिंसासत््ययायास््ततेतेयब्रह्मचर््यापरिग्रहा यमाः ॥ २.३० ॥ Ahimsāsatyāsteyabrahmacharyāparigrahā Yamah || 2.30 || Yama consists of five principles: Ahimsā (non-violence), Satya (truthfulness), Asteya (non-stealing), Brahmacharya (moderation), and Aparigraha (non-possessiveness).

Now, let us explore yogic concepts for cultivating ourselves into better individuals. Niyama Through Yamas, we learn to interact with the world in a kind and honest manner. Niyamas help us focus on our inner self. Maharishi Patañjali provides us with five Niyamas, personal guidelines that help us lead a joyful and fulfilling life. The five Niyamas are Śhaucha (cleanliness), Santoṣha (contentment), Tapas (self-discipline), Svādhyāya (self-study), and Īśhvara Praṇidhāna (surrender to the divine). Niyama teaches us to look within, rather than focusing solely on what is happening around us. शौचसन््ततोतोषतपःस््ववावाध््ययायायेश्वरप्रणिधानानि नियमाः ॥ २.३२॥ śhauchasantoṣhatapahsvādhyāyeśvarapraṇidhānāni niyamah || 2.32 || 1.

It teaches us that true happiness is not just about having more things, but instead, it is about appreciating what you already have in your life. When we practice Santoṣha, we feel calm and at ease. We can also cultivate a deeper sense of contentment by appreciating the good in others, being kind to everyone, finding joy in giving, and learning to forgive. This does not mean we ignore our potential to grow, instead, it is about truly enjoying what we have, even with its limitations, much like a child who finds pure happiness in small, simple things. 3. Tapas (Self-discipline): Tapas means self-discipline, dedication, and determination. Cultivating tapas empowers us with the inner strength to pursue our goals and navigate life’s challenges diligently. It is the willpower that enables us to remain disciplined in our actions, stay consistent in our efforts, and even willingly set aside immediate comforts for the sake of achieving a larger objective. 4. Svādhyāya (Self-study): Svādhyāya means self-study, which helps us develop self-discipline. We can understand ourselves better through activities like reading, meditation, and self-reflection. Even when we do any task with focus and effort, we learn more about ourselves. Additionally, gaining knowledge through books and experienced persons enriches your understanding and makes life easier and happier. 5. Īśhvara Praṇidhāna (Surrender to the divine): Īśhvara Praṇidhāna means completely surrendering to a higher power. By regularly engaging in self-study, we grow in self-awareness, which in turn can lead us to develop a deep trust in this higher power. We can nurture this profound devotion by practising bhakti such as through prayer and by reading inspiring devotional texts. This dedicated practice"}

To maintain mental purity or health, let us explore and understand the Ariṣaḍvargas, which are like enemies of the mind. The Ariṣhaḍvargas are six negative forces that can disturb our minds. They are: Ariṣhaḍvargas (Six major enemies of the mind) Desire (Kāma) Anger (Krodha) Greed (Lobha) Attachment (Moha) Arrogance (Mada) Jealousy (Matsarya) Think of your mind as a calm, clear pond.

Its usual state of pristine clarity, mirroring the expansive sky, evoked a sense of tranquillity and joy within her. The pond’s transparency allowed her to witness the vibrant life beneath the surface, where she observed the fish in their natural habitat. However, the pond’s condition was not always peaceful. Following turbulent weather or instances of pollution, the water would become murky and disturbed. This transformation saddened Anjali, as the loss of the clear reflection obscured the pond’s beauty, concealed its inhabitants, and created an overall sense of disorder. One day, Anjali’s grandmother used the pond as an example to explain the nature of the human mind. She explained that when our thoughts are pure and untainted— Śhaucha— we"}

We can perceive situations and emotions with accuracy and achieve inner peace. However, negative emotions, such as envy, anger, greed, attachment, and sadness, act like pollutants, clouding our minds and distorting our perceptions. Anjali understood the analogy and began to apply the principle of purity, or Śhaucha, to her mental state. When she experienced feelings of superiority or a desire to be the best, she reminded herself of the unique strengths and talents inherent in every individual. When confronted with anger towards her brother, she practised mindful breathing and sought to understand his perspective. She discovered that by maintaining a clear and uncluttered mind, she was able to experience greater peace, improved focus, and healthier relationships.

In this grade, let us explore Sthūla vyāyāma and improve our physical stamina. Sthūla vyāyāma refers to a set of yogic exercises involving more vigorous movements than simple stretches. These exercises help improve overall physical fitness, strength, and flexibility. Often called ‘loosening exercises’, Sthūla vyāyāma typically involves repetitive movements that prepare the body for more advanced yoga practices or other physical activities. Think of them as a way to warm up the body and prepare it for more intense activity. 1. Rekhā gati (line walking) Come to a standing posture. Step 1: Stand with your left foot flat on the ground. Bring your right foot forward. Place the heel of your right foot so it gently touches the toes of your left foot. Step 2: Take twenty steps forward.

It's an excellent way to greet the sun and start the day on a positive note. In Grade 8, we will explore the different names of the Sun and how chanting them during Sūrya Namaskāra can instil positive qualities within us. Each round of Sūrya Namaskāra begins with the chanting of ‘Om’ followed by a specific name of the Sun. These names are a part of a mantra— sound combinations believed to positively influence our minds, making them more active, efficient, and healthy. It is believed that chanting the Sun’s name while performing the Sūrya Namaskāra helps us develop qualities like friendship, devotion, energy, health, strength, and vigour. By focusing on these positive qualities associated with the Sun, we connect with the divine and bring these virtues into our lives. Chapter 3 Āsana Āsana"}

This year, we will learn new āsana to enhance stability, balance, and flexibility. We will also focus on how to perform these āsanas with ease and effortlessness. Yoga is known for its many practices, but āsanas is the most popular. Some people even think that practising āsanas is all that yoga is about! there is to yoga! Long ago, spiritual seekers"}
{"class": "class 8", "subject": "phe", "page_no": 208, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "194 Khel Yatra used āsanas mainly to prepare us for meditation. Today, we understand that āsanas can also help us manage the challenges of daily life. In the Yoga Sutras, Maharishi Patañjali described āsana as a means to cultivate a positive mindset. However, it is important to remember that āsanas are more than just physical exercises. They should be practised carefully and slowly, with full attention and awareness of the breath. Āsanas teach us how to care for and maintain our physical bodies. When we practise them, we use them as a foundation to turn our attention inward. As the Yoga Sutrā of Patañjali describes— स््थथिरसुखमम् आसनमम् । Sthirasukham āsanam । (2.46) That is, the posture should be steady and comfortable. This is key to performing āsanas. It means that we should aim for physical and mental stability and comfort in any posture. Sthira means ‘steady’, so holding the posture steadily is important. When you first start practising, it may feel challenging and even a little uncomfortable. However, do not worry! With regular practise, the āsana will become easier and more comfortable to do. Āsanas are often categorised into various groups to help us understand and practice them better; these include meditative, cultural, relaxing, and balancing poses. Before learning new āsanas, we must reinforce our understanding and practice of the ones we explored in the previous grades. These postures, which include poses like Ardhakati chakrāsana, Padmāsana, Bhujangāsana, Śhalabhāsana, Utkaṭāsana, Sarvāngāsana and Matsyāsana, are beneficial for building strength, flexibility, and balance. By revisiting these āsanas, we reinforce our understanding of their correct techniques and prepare our bodies for the more challenging āsanas that we will learn in this Grade."}

For safe and effective āsana practice, remember the following guidelines: • Always begin with warm-up exercises, such as Sūkṣhma Vyāyāma to prepare your body. Practise on an empty stomach, preferably in the morning. Breathe naturally through your nose with slow, deep breaths, and wear comfortable, loose clothing. • Avoid strain and overstretching; listen to your body’s signals. Focus on proper alignment and maintain a calm mind during practice. Conclude with a relaxation posture, such as Śhavāsana, and strive for consistent, daily practice for optimal benefits. For additional guidelines, please refer to the Grade 7 textbook. Vīrabhadrāsana (Warrior Pose) – Variation II Vīrabhadrāsana, also known as the Warrior Pose, is named after the mighty warrior Vīrabhadrā (Vīra meaning ‘warrior’, Bhadra meaning ‘best’). This legendary figure, associated with Sadāśhiva, arose from Lord Shiva’s anger to fight injustice, famously destroying Daksha’s yajna. He symbolises focused strength and righteous power. Practising this pose helps us connect with that warrior spirit, developing physical strength, flexibility, and balance. Mentally, it cultivates the determination, courage, and confidence needed to face life’s challenges, just like Vīrabhadrā."}

Feel it relaxing as you hold the attention there for a moment. Slowly move the focus up to the left knee, the left thigh, and finally, the left hip. Become aware of the entire left leg, allowing it to relax completely. 3. Now, bring the attention to the lower body— your pelvis (lower limbs), stomach, navel, and chest. 4. Bring attention to the right shoulder, right arm, palm, and fingers. Do the same for the left shoulder and left arm, palm and fingers. Next, focus on the throat, face, and the very top of the head. 5. While in this relaxed state, take a deep breath in. Notice how the body feels, and relax and enjoy this peaceful stillness for a few minutes. 6. Now, slowly become aware of the body and the space around you. Gently roll onto the right side and stay there for a few more minutes. 7. When you are ready, slowly sit up. Take the time, and when you feel comfortable, gently and gradually open your eyes. You can then rub the palms together to create warmth and gently cup them over the eyes."}

Notes for the teacher • Use clear and simple language that students can easily understand. • Encourage students to visualise the body parts they are focusing on. This helps them connect with their bodies on a deeper level. • Use a calm and soothing tone of voice to guide students through the practice. • Allow sufficient time for each practice step; do not rush the students. Kriyās Kriyās are special yoga techniques designed to purify the body from the inside out. While we all practice some form of cleansing daily, like bathing or brushing our teeth, yoga kriyās go deeper, targeting the internal organs. Over time, yogis have developed many kriyās, but six major ones, called the Ṣhhaṭa Kriyās, are considered the most important and comprehensive. They are: 1. Neti – Cleaning the nostrils 2. Dhouti – Cleaning the digestive tract 3. Bastī – Cleaning the bowels. 4. Naulī – Rolling the abdominal muscles 5. Trāṭaka – Gazing at one point 6. Kapālabhāti – Cleaning the frontal region of the brain"}

Kapāla means ‘skull’, and bhāti means ‘shining’, so Kapālabhāti means ‘shining skull’. In the Haṭha Yoga texts, it is classified under the Ṣhaṭ Kriyās. This practice involves active, rapid exhalation, while inhalation is a passive process. Practise guidelines • While practising Kapālabhāti, keep the body relaxed. • Never force the breath during the practice; start with 10 to 15 exhalations. • Practise this on an empty stomach. • Try to maintain a steady rhythm throughout the practice. • Girls should avoid this practice during menstruation. Step by step guide for the practice • Sit in a comfortable posture, such as Vajrāsana or Sukhāsana, with the spine erect, face relaxed, and eyes gently closed. • Adopt Chin Mudrā. • Inhale once, then exhale rapidly, like a blacksmith’s bellows, drawing the abdominal muscles inward as the air is expelled through the nostrils. • This practice can be performed for 10 to 20 exhalations, depending on one’s capacity. • When the practice is stopped, the breath halts automatically. This state is called Sahaja or Kevala Kumbhaka, and it is considered the most critical aspect of Kapālabhāti, which must be experienced. • When the breath stops naturally, the mind also becomes still, which is the ultimate goal of yoga practice."}

Pratyāhāra Pratyāhāra, is the fifth limb of Ashtānga Yoga, which teaches us to focus our minds by gently drawing our attention away from distractions. It is like turning down the noise of the outside world to better hear what’s happening within us. Pratyāhāra is a practice that helps to calm our mind by training our five senses (sight, hearing, taste, touch, and smell) to draw nourishment from within, rather than just from the outside world. The word Pratyāhāra comes from Sanskrit– Prati means ‘away from’, and āhāra means ‘nourishment.’ Thus, Pratyāhāra refers to withdrawing the senses from external stimuli. Think of it like a tortoise drawing its limbs into its shell for protection; in the same way, Pratyāhāra teaches us to withdraw our senses from distractions gently. By practising Indriya Pratyāhāra—the control of the senses— we learn to turn our attention inward. When you want to concentrate, try gently pulling your awareness away from what you see, hear, taste, touch and smell. With regular practice, your ability to focus will strengthen, as if placing a ‘Do Not Disturb’ sign on your mind to preserve your concentration."}

Imagine your eyes are closed—even if they are open—and focus only on the darkness behind your eyelids. • Hearing: Try not to pay attention to the sounds around you. Instead, listen only to your quiet thoughts. • Smell: Gently ignore any smells in the air. Notice the air as it comes in and out of your nose. • Taste: Be aware of the taste in your mouth, but do not try to change or focus on it too much. Just let it be. • Touch: Notice how your body is sitting or resting. Observe the sensations, but do not get too involved in them. Just be aware. Take a few slow, deep breaths while your ‘senses are inside your shell.’ Notice how your mind feels a little quieter and more still.

Notice how you feel. Think about how it felt to pull your attention inward gently. Did it help you feel more focused or calmer? This simple practice is a little taste of Pratyāhāra, learning to create your own ‘inner shell’ to protect your focus. You can try this anytime you need to concentrate. This skill can also be helpful in many situations, like studying, paying attention in class, or dealing with overwhelming feelings. DhāraṆa, Dhyāna and Samādhi Notes for the teacher • Read the activity beforehand to familiarise the students with the steps and the intended experience. • You may choose to play soft, calming background music. • Briefly discuss how focusing inward can enhance students' learning and understanding. • Encourage students to share their experiences. Dhāraṇa, Dhyāna and Samādhi are limbs of Ashtānga Yoga that help calm and still the mind. These practices are about learning to control the mind and improve focus. In them, the mind becomes the most important tool. Understanding how our mind works is the key to being healthy and happy— these three practices support this understanding. They lead to a state where we can control our thoughts, gain wisdom, and experience deep peace and joy. Essentially, they involve training the mind to concentrate on one specific object. Focus means keeping your attention on a single point. It has two main aspects— first, it involves keeping the mind within a specific boundary, not allowing it to wander. Second, even when many things try to distract you, focus is about actively choosing to stay with that one thing. Focusing takes effort, and the more distractions there are, the harder it becomes."}
{"class": "class 8", "subject": "phe", "page_no": 237, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "223 Yoga What is Dhāraṇa? This ‘spot’ for meditation could be a thought, an object, or a sound (like a mantra). Fixing the mind on one of these is called Dhāraṇa. Dhāraṇa means ‘holding’ or ‘absorbing’ focus and is about concentrating on a specific area or object. It is not about focusing on a tiny point but rather about keeping the mind within a specific boundary. You can focus on many things, depending on your intention. For example, some ancient teachings suggest focusing on the navel to understand the human body or on the throat to control hunger and thirst. You might also focus on a statue, the story of a wise person, or even the breath. Practising Dhāraṇa helps us become more aware of ourselves and less ignorant. It makes the mind more stable and less prone to wandering, bringing peace and emotional balance. In this grade, let us learn the art of focusing through the practice of Jyoti Trāṭaka. Our eyes are amazing organs that allow us to see the world around us. However, with its stresses and increased screen time, modern life can negatively affect our vision. Yoga offers a practice called Trāṭaka, which may help reduce stress and improve specific eye problems. Trāṭaka means ‘steady gazing’ or ‘concentrated viewing.’ It is a practice where you focus on an object or a symbol. In Jyoti Trāṭaka, we use the light or flame of a lamp as the point of focus, and preparatory exercises are performed before practising it. Let us now follow a step-by-step preparatory practice for Jyoti Trāṭaka."}
