The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured the students’ inherent abilities and touching upon all the five planes of human existence, the pañchakośhas, in the foundational and the preparatory stages have paved the way for the progression of their learning further at the middle stage. Thus, the middle stage acts as a bridge between the preparatory and the secondary stages, spanning three years from Grade 6 to 8. The NCF-SE 2023, at the middle stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages, including at least two languages native to India, science, mathematics, social science, art education, physical education and well-being, and vocational education, promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy—a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establishing conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject experts, pedagogues, and practising"}

Kaushal Bodh, the activity book of vocational education for Grade 8, is one of these. Its content comprises projects related to three work forms— life forms, machines and materials, and human services. The projects will help students to develop knowledge, skills, attitude and values alongside ecological sensitivity, gender sensitivity, digital skills, and life skills. For all practical purposes, it has, to my mind, succeeded in its curricular goals: first, to foster natural curiosity among students through a proper selection of project; and second, develop among them the core competencies, such as communication, creativity, critical thinking, and green skill and vocational skills, such as application of tools, and procedures for design and developing products by intelligently designing various activities, thereby seamlessly integrating content and pedagogy within meaningful contexts. However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries, laboratories and workshops play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this activity book and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years.

{"class": "class 8", "subject": "vocational education", "page_no": 5, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "About the Book Kaushal Bodh, the activity book of vocational education for Grade 8 is developed in alignment with the vision of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023. In the NCF-SE 2023, work has been categorised under three broad forms: Work with Life Forms, Work with Machines and Materials, and Work in Human Services. The intent at this stage is to provide vocational exposure to the students through a wide range of activities categorised into three forms of work. To achieve this, students are expected to take up nine projects across Grade 6 to 8, i.e., three projects in each grade and one from each form of work. Curricular goals, competencies, and learning outcomes have been the guiding principles while developing the Activity Book. The following Curricular Goals (CG) given in the Activity Book cover a range of competencies. CG-1: Develops in-depth basic skills and allied knowledge of work and their associated materials or procedures; CG-2: Understands the place and usefulness of vocational skills and vocations in the world of work; CG-3: Develops essential values while working across areas; and CG-4: Develops basic skills and allied knowledge to run and contribute to a home. The activity book contains six illustrative projects, two for each form of work, intended to cover the above curricular goals. The choice of projects is left entirely to schools. One project may be taken up by students or preferably, the school can design other projects based on local considerations. The NCF-SE 2023, and indeed this activity book, encourages schools to select projects based on local considerations and availability of resources. Annexure 1 provides a template for designing a project other than those in the book. The illustrative projects are described as follows: Project 1 is on developing Hydroponics: Growing Plants without Soil. Students will engage in establishing and maintaining hydroponic units in school. They will draw on their learning in Science classrooms"}

They will learn about environmentally friendly practices that can be used for plant propagation. Project 2 is on Feeding and Caring for Farm Animals. Students will engage with animals to develop sensitivity towards their well-being. They will appreciate the diversity of domesticated animals that support human life. This project will enhance their observational skills related to animal behaviour and its interpretation. It will also instill a sense of care and the importance of preserving the well-being of animals. Project 3 is on Working with Wood and Bamboo. In this project, students will explore various techniques used for working with wood and bamboo. They will learn to use tools and materials to create functional or artistic items, fostering creativity, problem-solving, and technical skills. This project will encourage innovation and creative thinking, preparing students for potential careers in design. Project 4 is on Home Automation. It will introduce students to the fundamentals of electronics and programming. They will learn to automate simple systems in their surroundings. This project will enhance their technological proficiency, creativity, and logical thinking. Project 5 is on Water Audit for Water Management. Students will engage with real-life data to learn how to draw conclusions and make simple predictions. They will collect primary data using estimations based on scientific principles. They will also engage with secondary data, learning how to acknowledge sources. This project will develop sensitivity towards the needs of all as well as a sense of environmental stewardship. Project 6 is on Advertising for Small Businesses. In this project, students will reflect on the role of advertisements in our life. They will identify elements of advertisements to understand both the marketing and ethical dimensions. They will learn about small businesses and make advertisements for them using different media. This project will develop discernment to review advertisements and other media of communication for veracity. As the culmination of the work done through the year related to vocational education, a Kaushal Mela will be held at the end of the year to both showcase the products students have created and the services they have learnt. It will also be an opportunity for students to share"}

Community members and education functionaries may be invited to the Kaushal Mela. Planning, being an important outcome of vocational education, a section is devoted to helping students plan and design the Kaushal Mela. Finally, annexures include a project planning template, competencies and learning outcomes to be achieved in Grade 8, suggestive projects in each of the forms of work in some detail, and mapping of learning outcomes with time required for each of the illustrative projects. Cross-cutting themes, such as Indian Knowledge Systems, values, heritage, gender sensitivity, and inclusion have been integrated into all the projects. Reflective and thought-provoking questions included under different activities are engaging and they promote joyful learning along with assessment as and for learning. Students are provided opportunities to do different things, record small successes, take and give feedback, work with peers, try and re-try, answer-questions, reflect, in short, and experience the values related to work. Illustrations have been designed depicting the context to enhance learning. In-text questions are also included to assess comprehension of the activities. The end of the project questions given in ‘Think and Answer’ are designed to encourage critical thinking, reasoning, responding, and analysing. Students can access the additional resources provided in the Quick Response (QR) code for each project. We sincerely hope that the students will enjoy doing these projects and that these will help in developing the desired and intended competencies.

{"class": "class 8", "subject": "vocational education", "page_no": 10, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "Note for School Heads and Teachers Teachers are pivotal to achieving the goals set out in the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 introduces vocational education as a distinct subject starting in Grade 6. The purpose of this subject is to promote ‘learning by doing’, ‘dignity of labour’, and the development of vocational capacities through exposure to a wide range of work. Successful implementation will aid in developing responsible and confident adults who value all professions. Vocational Education in schools also offers a robust medium for holistic learning by offering students opportunities to apply conceptual learning in other curricular areas to real-life situations. In Grade 8, students will take up one project in each of the ‘Forms of Work’. The sequence of these projects is not important, so long as all the projects are completed within the academic year. These projects can be taken up at the same time or one after the other. Groups of students may also take up different projects, which depends on the nature of the project and other factors, such as the number of students, resources available, and so on. Please note that it is important to identify concepts across curricular areas that students need to know (e.g., seed germination for agriculture related projects in life forms) and ensure that they have been covered before starting the project. In this Activity Book, the projects are designed as per the Learning Outcomes for Vocational Education in Grade 8. The focus is on the following: 1. Using physical tools/equipment for carrying out different processes to perform authentic tasks. 2. Gaining clarity about what is to be done and reaching the final outcome through breaking down the task into smaller activities. 3. Understanding how to prepare materials and use tools and equipment, while following safety measures and protocols. 4. Connecting the activities done in school to the world of work. 5. Assessing work done in terms of quantity and quality. 6. Applying what is learnt in school to daily life. 7. Working collaboratively in groups while ensuring individual participation in each activity."}
{"class": "class 8", "subject": "vocational education", "page_no": 11, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "xi In doing the above, students will be able to develop values related to work, particularly respect for all work. They will realise the importance of the dignity of labour, which means that no work is considered superior and therefore, no work or person should be discriminated against on any basis. The projects in the Activity Book are illustrative. Schools can choose to take up any one or design their own projects from each form of work. Annexure 1 provides guidelines for designing a project in alignment with curricular goals, competencies and learning outcomes. Annexure 3 has details of five additional projects in each form of work. Thus, for each form of work, schools may (i) select one project from each form of work; (ii) design their own projects; and (iii) further detail out any one of the additional projects given in the Activity Book. Pedagogy and Assessment Projects comprise a set of activities that are generally expected to be completed in a group or individually, as required. Resources for projects (e.g., tools, equipment, materials, use of workspaces, etc.) and resource persons or master instructors (e.g., mechanics, farmers, craftspersons, artisans, persons working in technology, and experts in the field) must be drawn from the community. Exposure visits and interactions with professionals are built into the project to enable students to observe and understand work in real settings. The total time allotted to vocational education is 110 hours or 165 periods in one academic year, excluding time for assessment, school events, bagless days and similar activities (Section 4.3 of the NCF-SE 2023). These periods may be distributed across the week as two blocks of two periods on week-days and one period on Saturday. Each project is expected to be completed in about 30 hours (approximately 55 periods of 40 minutes each). This duration is to ensure a long-term engagement that allows students to complete a set of interrelated activities. It also gives them time for trial and error, to try out things differently, and to extend their learning into other activities."}
{"class": "class 8", "subject": "vocational education", "page_no": 12, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "xii The focus of the projects must be creativity and demonstration of skills, and the process of ‘doing’ rather than the ‘product’ or outcome. Working in groups and observing people with expertise is important to foster an appreciation for teamwork, creativity, sensitivity, persistence, and other important values related to work. Students must be active throughout, as they take up activities that are directly connected to real life and the world of work. They must be able to integrate learning from other curricular areas into the projects. Prevalent biases must be addressed, for example, by assigning work roles to diverse gender and to students from all social groups. All students must participate in all activities. To ensure the participation of divyang students, projects can be adapted or an entirely different project may be developed. The activity book is designed to enable continuous assessment by teachers, as well as self and peer-assessment by students. The questions and formats for recording require students to assess their own progress, share their learning and reflections, and record their answers as they move from one activity to the next. Students must also maintain a portfolio in order to help them see their own progress, and record the processes and products related to the projects. It may contain any work done by students, including additional notes, presentations, sketches or photographs (besides those in the activity book) related to the project, and products they have created. Assessing the inculcation of values related to work (e.g., initiative, persistence and focus, responsibility, discipline, eye for detail, curiosity and creativity, empathy and sensitivity, and willingness to do physical work) is particularly important. Students must be observed while at work to assess the same. Checklists and rubrics that outline specific behaviours and attitudes related to work values may be developed by the teachers. Annexure 2 contains the competencies to be developed across the middle stage and the learning outcomes to be achieved in Grade 8."}
{"class": "class 8", "subject": "vocational education", "page_no": 13, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "xiii While this is true for all subjects, the role of feedback is particularly important in Vocational Education. Students must be encouraged and motivated by recognition of their work and their creativity. This approach ensures that all students are able to complete their work successfully through ongoing guidance, which in turn is motivating. Summative assessment for Grade 8 can, for example, comprise a viva voce, presentation, role-play, simulation, group discussion, and the review of students’ responses to prompts or questions in the activity book. If you wish to use a paper–pencil test, it could include situational questions, concept maps, flowcharts, questions related to learning from visits, and multiple choice questions. Each project also has a set of questions in the last section. These questions address key aspects of learning and concepts that are strengthened while doing the activities. To reiterate, the focus must be on assessing capacities and understanding of processes. Weightage to the theoretical aspects is suggested as 20 per cent and 80 per cent for the practical aspects. A suggested weightage and marking scheme for assessment and evaluation is given below: Mode of Assessment Weightage Written Test 10% Oral Presentation/Viva Voce 30% Activity Book 30% Portfolio 10% Teachers’ Observations during Activities 20% Criteria for Project Selection The activity book is meant for students, and therefore ‘speaks’ to them. There are various components in each project, as indicated by the headings of sections (please refer to Annexure 1). These components are aligned with the competencies defined for Vocational Education in the NCF-SE 2023 (please refer to Annexure 2). Therefore, any project other than those in the activity book must include the same components. The illustrative list of projects given in Annexure 3."}

Students must also be encouraged to come up with ideas for projects. If the school decides to choose a project other than those in the Activity Book, the following must be kept in mind for all the forms of work: 1. Is the project appropriate for students in Grade 8? 2. Does the project help students use learning from other subjects? 3. Is the project related to the work the students see around them? 4. Will the students be able to interact with persons who are experts in the work related to the project? 5. Will the students be able to get hands-on experience? 6. Will students be able to take up different kinds of activities within the project? 7. Will students find the activities within the project challenging and interesting? 8. Will students learn something they can use at home? 9. Will it develop the values related to work, particularly the dignity of labour? 10. Will the project help students acquire vocational capacities for their daily living (e.g., using technology, consciousness of environmental concerns and sustainability, taking care of oneself, doing small tasks at home, and the like)?

Students must work in groups and the use of Internet by them must be supervised by the teacher or an expert. Who will teach? Since the purpose of vocational education in the middle stage is to provide vocational exposure to students, and till such time that teacher education programmes offer specialisation in vocational education, existing teachers will take up this subject in the Middle stage (Grade 6 to 8), with the support of resource persons/master instructors. A teacher of any subject can take the lead in organising activities for projects in which they have some understanding and expertise. The Head of the School may nominate a “Teacher Coordinator” among the existing teachers to coordinate and schedule the activities of different projects to be undertaken at the Middle stage. Safety Measures Due care must be taken to ensure safety at all times. Safety measures must be demonstrated to students, who must, in turn, also demonstrate their understanding of how to keep themselves and others safe. Where necessary, use of certain tools and materials by students may be supervised in small groups. Due safety during field visits, ranging from transportation to orientation of resource persons must receive necessary attention. Internet safety or cyber safety is critical when students are accessing the Internet or using AI tools. Students must be made aware of the consequences and implications of sharing private information, visiting sites that are not approved by the teacher, or sharing of passwords."}

When you think about work, you must remember two things: (i) all work is important; and (ii) people work not only to make a living, but also to make life more joyful and interesting. In daily life, you see people doing various kinds of work. Some of the work is related to running a household while some is related to earning a living. How to use the Activity Book? Read through the introduction of the project to get an idea of what you will be doing. Materials Needed Gather all the materials listed at the beginning of each activity. Follow the Steps 1. Each activity has clear, numbered steps. Follow them to complete each task. Take your time and make sure you understand each step before moving on. Take notes during field visits or interaction with experts. 2. Complete all the questions and tables given in the activity book; this will help you to both learn and check your understanding. Check Your Work After completion of the task, reflect on what you have learnt and what else you want to learn. Questions have been included to help you both think and write about what you are doing. Write in your own words, Vocational education prepares you to deal with practical things related to daily life and understand the world of work. This will happen through projects that you will do in school. These projects will give you an opportunity to work with your hands, work in groups with your peers, and learn the skills which help you become self-dependent in life."}

After finishing an activity, review your work. Make sure you have completed all the steps and check your answers. If the space in the activity book is not enough, please use a different notebook or loose sheets, which you can add to the portfolio. Ask for Help If you are unsure about any part of an activity, do not hesitate to ask a teacher, parent, or peers for help. Ask as many questions as needed if something is unclear. Collaboration and discussion can make learning more fun and effective. You can also get help from Internet searches or using AI tools. AI tools make our tasks easy by helping us find things or do something quickly. Some examples of AI tools are ChatGPT, tools for translation or for finding information about something. Please note that AI is not necessary for your projects; you can use it if you want. Take Short Breaks Do not rush through the activities. If you start feeling tired, take a short break during the activities. Be Creative Some activities may have open-ended questions or ask for your creative inputs. Let your imagination flow and write about your ideas and experiences. Stay Positive Learning new things can be challenging. Stay positive and remember that practice makes you perfect. Reflect Think about what you have learned from each activity. Share your progress with peers and teachers and ask for their feedback."}

But as the world population grows, the demand for food also increases. More and more land is needed to meet this demand — this land is taken from forests, leading to deforestation. Deforestation leads to the loss of biodiversity and contributes to climate change. Another challenge is that, as the same land is used over the years to grow plants, it loses its nutrients, which is known as soil degradation. Heavy use of fertilisers to compensate for the loss of nutrients further degrades the soil quality due to the chemical component of most fertilisers. Besides loss of nutrients, erosion caused by wind and rain, water pollution due to industrial drainage, land degradation due to mining activities and even excessive water for irrigation, all contribute to the reduction of the land available for farming and the quality of produce. The Government of India is encouraging farmers to use hydroponics through the Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare. Technologies like hydroponics, and aeroponics in which plants are not in direct contact with soil, are being promoted under this mission. In India, nearly 33% of the Total Geographical Area (TGA) is affected by soil degradation. This means we are losing our fertile farming land. Nearly 109 million hectares of land is facing declining soil quality. The focus of agricultural scientists, nutritionists, engineers and environmental experts has been to help farmers adopt sustainable farming practices. Sustainable farming aims to produce food that is healthy for humans with minimum negative impact on the environment. The term hydroponics is derived from the Greek words ‘hydro’, that is, water, and ‘ponos’, that is, labour or toil. Hydroponics is a method of growing plants in a nutrient- rich water solution instead of soil (Figures 1.1 and 1.2). Plants in a hydroponic unit receive nutrients directly from the water"}

Take special care when using sharp tools and power-driven machines like a drill machine and a submersible pump. 2. Safety while using electrical gadgets: Be careful while working with gadgets like aerators and submersible pumps. Work only under the supervision of the teacher or expert. Internet safety: Ask your teacher for help while using the Internet. Be careful not to upload or download anything without checking. Do not share personal information with anyone. What do I need to know before I start? You have learnt in Science as well as in Vocational Education that plants require certain essential conditions to grow. Air, temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, nutrients, soil and water are necessary for the growth of plants. Try to use waste materials for your project. So, use scrapped plastic bottles and cups, Styrofoam sheets, and pipes to build hydroponic systems. Now, reflect on whether these needs can be fulfilled even without soil.

Can we replace soil and ensure conditions are fulfilled? Germination of seeds Seeds absorb water and start the germination process. Yes. Seeds can be soaked in water to germinate just like we make sprouts. Physical support for plants Roots hold soil to provide support to plants. In hydroponics, plants are placed on floating sheets or net pots to hold them above water, thus providing the required support. Sunlight for growth Plants absorb sunlight to make their food through photosynthesis. Sunlight and artificial light are both used in hydroponics. Nutrients for plant growth Plant roots absorb minerals in the soil. In hydroponics, minerals (nutrients) are added to water in the required quantity and absorbed by plant roots. Any other specific need Plants or crops are sown directly in the soil with the addition of compost or fertilisers. Growth media are used instead of soil. Some common growth media are coco coir, coco peat, gravel, sand, red-brick or clay, pebbles, rockwool, and vermicompost. In addition to the above, plants also need help from microbes. You are probably aware that microbes are organisms that cannot be seen without a microscope. Microbes do multiple things useful for plants, like breaking down complex organic matter into simpler compounds so that plant roots can absorb them easily, suppress diseases and help in communication with neighbouring plants. However, care needs to be taken to ensure that only microbes that help plants grow are added to the water."}

Vertical stacking of water tubs is complex due to the heavy load of the water reservoir. So, what if we take water near the root zone instead of placing the roots in standing water? This allow you to increase the number of plants while using lesser amount of water and utilise the vertical space. In this method, plants stand in a shallow stream of water. Water flows in the form of a thin film containing plant nutrients. As water continuously flows in a stream, NFT does not require an air pump to increase dissolved oxygen.

Activity 6: Making compost tea You might have probably used compost or vermicompost while working with plants. Compost is made of decaying plants, food waste or manure. You will need liquid compost for a hydroponic system. To make liquid compost, also known as compost tea, you will need a good quality compost from kitchen/garden waste. You can also use animal manure to make liquid manure. A good compost is dark brown to black with a pleasant earthy smell and crumbly (like tea leaves) texture. You can make compost tea by following the steps as shown in Figure 1.10. After 2–3 days you will get a brown liquid ready to use for hydroponics. You can add 1L liquid compost to 10L hydroponic water. Figure 1.10: Process of making compost tea"}

Let us check the pH of your hydroponic system. For this, you will need a strip of pH paper. Check the pH of your hydroponic system using the pH paper. Generally, if the pH is more than 7, then you need to reduce the pH of hydroponic water by adding a weak acid like Acetic acid (Vinegar) or Citric acid (lime juice).

Poultry birds, cattle, buffaloes, bulls, sheep, yaks, mithun (gayal), pigs and camels are reared by farmers for food, wool, transportation, and to provide labour for farm operations. They are also crucial for soil fertility as they provide organic manure. Domestic animals on a farm are collectively called livestock and comprise a large part of farmers’ wealth, and contribute regularly to their income. Besides farmers, herders specialising in one kind of livestock, for example, shepherds, goatherds, swineherds, and cowherds, also have a large number of livestock. Besides the economic benefits, animals respond to love and care, and become a part of the family, even providing emotional support to individuals or families. Therefore, their care is an essential part of the farmers’ work. Nutritious food, clean water, proper shelter, and vaccination are necessary for the good health of livestock. Paintings in the Bhimbetka caves in Madhya Pradesh show evidence of the relationship between humans and animals. Decorated bulls, grazing animals, and human riding horses and animals suggest that domesticated animals have been our companions for more than 10,000 years (Figure 2.2).

They may become aggressive. So, do not disturb or excite the animal while recording your observations. You need to stay calm and avoid making abrupt gestures. Also, speaking to the animal and offering feed helps reduce animal stress and aggression. 2. Tie animals and maintain a safe distance. Never stand behind a large farm animal, as it may kick you, if disturbed. 3. Interact with animals only when you are accompanied by a teacher, farmer or a veterinary professional. Follow the instructions they give while approaching an animal. Internet safety: Ask your teacher for help while using the Internet. Be careful not to upload or download anything without checking.

Apart from a caring approach, the environment in which animals live also plays an important role in the well-being of livestock. For example, research by scientists has concluded that playing music in cow sheds has a calming effect. The result is an increase in milk production. This is due to the masking of noises (e.g., of farm machinery). Activity 2: Field visit to a veterinary clinic/animal healthcare centre Just like humans, domestic animals have healthcare requirements. Animal healthcare centres or veterinary clinics provide necessary healthcare services to livestock. Veterinary practitioners also need specialised training and certification. The Veterinary Council of India (VCI) is the nodal authority that decides how veterinarians should be prepared to work with animals. Visit a veterinary centre in a village or nearby town to learn standard healthcare practices and treatment required by livestock. You can also invite a veterinary doctor or practitioner to your school to learn about basic healthcare requirements. India ranks number one in the world for its cow and goat population. We are the largest producer of milk and also have the highest diversity among cows, with 43 registered native breeds. Breeds indicate various types of animals within the same kind, e.g., Kasargod cattle from Kerala are a dwarf breed that grows up to an average height of 1 metre (Figure 2.6). It produces high quality milk at low maintenance cost. Siri cattle from parts of Figure 2.6: Kasargod Dwarf Cattle Sikkim, Darjeeling and Bhutan have long, powerful legs that are helpful in the mountains; they are used as draught animals.

The following should be considered while selecting the animal(s): 1. It is better to choose small and friendly animals that are easy to handle, such as a goat or sheep, instead of a bullock, buffalo or cow. Do remember that bucks/bully goats or male goats are more aggressive than females. 2. Ensure that the teacher/farmer/animal owner or a veterinary professional is present before approaching the animal. 3.

It affects feed requirements, disease treatment, production levels (milk, eggs, and weight gain), and selling price. You can use a regular weighing scale for small animals, like poultry, whereas a suitable scale may not always be available for larger animals, like cattle, goats, camels, and horses. To solve this problem, you can estimate their body weight by measuring their dimensions. You already know the connection between volume, density, and weight. Using these, you can calculate weight with a simple formula: Weight=Volume×Density This simple equation is the basis for calculating of the weight of a farm animal.

A proper feeding schedule and providing quality feed are important for the health of animals. The feed requirement of an animal depends on the type of digestive system (ruminant versus non-ruminant), feeding habits, and productivity. Ruminant livestock (cow, buffalo, goat, sheep) have four chambers in the stomach. Ruminants can digest low-quality grass compared to non- ruminant (horses, pigs, poultry) animals. Cattle and buffalo prefer grass as feed, while goats and camels prefer tender leaves from shrubs and weeds. Feed requirement is determined by weight and Dry Matter (DM) requirement. You have already estimated the weight of two animals. DM is simply the non-water portion of animal feed. Generally, DM equal to 2–3 per cent of the animal’s live body weight is required by an adult animal everyday. The feed requirement of animals is directly related to their weight (Table 2.8). In an earlier activity, you had estimated the weight of two animals. Table 2.8: Feed requirements of goat Weight of the animal DM = 3% of the weight of the animal Concentrate feed = 25% of DM Total fodder (Wet+dry) = 75% of DM Dry fodder = 25% of total fodder Green fodder = 75% of the total fodder Actual green fodder requir- ement 32 kg goat, i.e., 32000g 32000g×3% = 960g/day 960×25% =240g 720g 720×25% =180g 720×75% = 540g 540×5 = 2735g Let us assume one of the animals was a goat weighing 32 kg. • It will need 3% DM per day, that is 960 g per day. • To ensure the goat’s health, 25% of the total DM should be from protein-rich concentrate and 75% from green and dry fodder."}

So, the quantity in Table 2.8 is increased by 5 times. Otherwise, the goat feels hungry just like you feel hungry after having only fruit juice or rice in your meal. Therefore, the total DM requirement and feeding options will be as illustrated in Table 2.8. • The feed should be given to the goat 2–3 times daily in equal quantities. For example, at dawn, midday, and early evening. Following this example, calculate the feeding requirement of your selected animals. The first step is to estimate the weight, then the DM requirements, and then different feeds, such as concentrate, green and dry fodder. Using a Mobile Application for Animal Feed Calculation You can also use mobile applications designed to calculate the feeding requirements of farm animals. The Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) has developed a ‘feeding chart’ mobile application for milking cows and buffaloes in collaboration with the National Institute of Animal Nutrition and Physiology (NIANP). Similarly, the Central Institute for Research on Goat (CIRG) has developed a mobile application for goat farming. Prepare a feeding chart for at least two animals using Table 2.9. Compare the actual feed given by the animal owner versus your calculated feeding need (Table 2.9).

It is prepared from green fodder to maintain it without losing its nutritional value. The word silage is derived from ‘silo’ meaning a pit or container with stored food. You will learn to make silage from green fodder, with controlled fermentation in an anaerobic (without oxygen) environment. Science of Silage Making For example, we make a pickle from mango or any other fruit or vegetable; silage is a pickle of green fodder for ruminants. You are using a naturally controlled fermentation process for silage making. It is like making pickles of cucumber or curd from milk. In this process, sugar content in green fodder gets converted into lactic acid by the action of ‘fermentative lactic acid bacteria’. These bacteria grow in anaerobic conditions. Due to bacterial growth, the temperature of the silage increases during the initial 2 to 8 days and acidity increases due to lactic acid (pH decreases up to 4.0 to 3.8) in 15 to 20 days. Step 1: Chop it using a fodder chopping machine to 2–3cm. You can collect chopped fodder from a farmer/animal owner or do this activity directly in the fields. Collect approximately 30–50kg of green fodder (any green fodder, like maize, sugarcane leaves, Napier grass can be used for silage). Chopping of fodder is essential so that we can compact it in a silage bag. If silage bags are unavailable, use any polyethene or High- Density Polyethene (HDPE) bag or container. You can make silage from green fodder by following the steps in Figure 2.11:"}
{"class": "class 8", "subject": "vocational education", "page_no": 72, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "Kaushal Bodh — Grade 8 50 Step 2: Fill the chopped fodder into the silage bag while pressing it firmly with your foot. Compacting or pressing chopped fodder in the bag removes air (oxygen). Step 3: Tie the upper end of the bag firmly with a thread. You can also seal it using adhesive tape to minimise air entry. The silage-making process gets completed in 2–3 weeks. During this process, do not open the bag. After 2–3 weeks, when you open the bag, the silage should have: • No fungal or mould growth • Golden brown colour • Pleasant fruity aroma • Free-flowing and non-sticky texture • Mildly acidic taste with an optimum pH of around 4.0–4.5 (add 25 g of silage to 100 mL of water; check pH after 15 minutes). Figure 2.11: Making silage from green fodder Once the silage is ready, you can use it to feed a goat, sheep (1 to 1.5kg per day), and a cow, buffalo (10 to 15kg per day) after taking the approval of the farmer/animal owner. Do not feed the animal without permission. If you observe mould of white or black colour, or observe a bad smell, throw away this silage and do not feed it to the animal. It will lead to food poisoning, serious illness and even death of the animal."}

Dry fodder provides the necessary Dry Matter for fulfilling appetite, helps in the better functioning of the digestive system and provides critical minerals to animals. The digestibility of dry fodder can be increased by adding a mineral mixture (which can be collected from a local veterinary clinic) and jaggery. This is a simple yet effective treatment for improving the palatability and digestibility of dry fodder, especially during harsh summer or dry season. You can do this activity directly in a farmer’s field or ask farmers/animal owners to help you do the activity in school. You can help them get dry fodder at school. You can treat dry fodder by following the steps shown in Figure 2.12. Step 1: Collect chopped dry fodder (5 to 10kg). It can be rice, wheat, jawar, hilly grass straw, or any legume crop stubble that farmers usually burn in the fields after crop harvest. Step 2: Add 3% jaggery (300g for 10 kg fodder) and common salt 1% (100g for 10kg fodder) in 5L of water. If jaggery is unavailable, you can use the waste flour of wheat, rice, jawar, etc. You can also add 100g of mineral mixture (optional).

From the wooden doors of our homes to fruit and vegetable carts, from school benches to cricket bats, wood baskets, fences, jewellery and toys—they are everywhere (Figure 3.1). They are also seen in the handles of our kitchen tools, bookshelves and even fishermen’s boats and oars. India is known for its ancient buildings and architectures. These buildings have stood the test of time. Most were built of wood, stone and other naturally occurring materials. From the Hidimba Temple in Manali, Rumtek Monastery in Sikkim and Vishrambaagh Wada in Pune—these buildings are renowned for their architecture and intricate decorative woodwork. Another example Figure 3.2: Padmanabhapuram Palace is the Padmanabhapuram Palace in Tamil Nadu, one of Asia’s largest wooden palaces (Figure 3.2). It was built four hundred years ago and is spread over 6.5 acres. Wood is used as fuel in some parts of the country. It is also used as construction material for making houses, tools, weapons, furniture, packaging, artworks, and paper. Craftsmen and carpenters have shaped wood into beautiful and functional objects for generations. Think of the carved wooden pillars in old temples, the sturdy bullock carts that travel through villages, or even the simple wooden ladle used to stir daal and curries. Humans have used this material in many imaginative ways for their benefits. Even when many different materials are available, wood is still used in many ways. Wood and bamboo are increasingly preferred over concrete and bricks for building houses and schools as they keep rooms cooler in summer and warmer in winter (Figure 3.3). Sports like cricket, badminton and hockey rely on strong wooden materials. In some places, even bridges and equipment in playgrounds are made from these materials because they are strong and last long."}

However, its use is not sustainable if its consumption exceeds the number of new trees planted. It must be noted that there are certain areas, such as those at high altitudes in the Himalayas, where trees do not grow easily. Once cut, entire forests disappear. Therefore, wood must be used judiciously. Ideally, the wood of a tree should be used after it has completed its lifecycle on earth—this is a sustainable approach compared to cutting off younger trees for wood. This approach is in alignment with our culture and traditions. While using natural resources, our ancestors used to pray to the earth. For example, the Atharva Veda says, “Whatever we dig out from you, O Earth! May that have quick regeneration. May we not damage our vital habitat and earth.” Substitutes like engineered wood or bamboo can be used instead of wood. Examples of engineered wood around you include plywood and Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF). Engineered wood is usually made using recycled wood, sawdust (fine particles or dust produced when wood goes through different processes in the production of objects), tiny wood particles, and wooden fibre. Bamboo, on the contrary, is a perennial grass and grows back when cut (Figure 3.4). There are several species of bamboo in India, and these are grown in many parts of the country, with the maximum amount being grown in the north-eastern part of India.

Do not share your personal information with anyone. What do I need to know before I start? Natural wood is available in hard and softwood, depending on the kind of tree. Wood from different trees is used for different purposes. For example, hardwood from babool and mango trees is used for construction (making houses, bridges, window frames, flooring, etc.), while the jackfruit tree is used for making furniture and small objects, like pooja stands, handicrafts, etc. Softwood from pine and deodar is used for making lightweight furniture, shelves and packing boxes, while eucalyptus (Nilgiri) is used for making paper.

It reduces the chances of making errors while making the actual object. 3. You can modify the design at a low cost since you used cardboard or waste wood. Hint: You can use glue instead of nails while working with cardboard, or you can also use cellophane tape. You can make hinges by piercing pieces of old wire into the cardboard (Figure 3.10). Figure 3.10 : Prototype of a hinge Step 1: Sketch a three-dimensional object with dimensions. Step 2: Collect material (cardboard/waste softwood, cutter, pencil, scale) and carefully mark the design on it. Ensure that the design is as per the sketch. Cut the material as per dimensions. Step 3: Assemble the project using glue and see whether it has come out as per your original design. Figure 3.9 : Basic steps for making a prototype of an object to make a small model of your chosen object. Remember, use the cardboard/softwood wisely, with minimum wastage.

Instead of switching things on and off by hand, automation uses sensors, controllers and simple computer programmes to run these tasks independently (Figure 4.1). Imagine a classroom where all students and teachers leave immediately after the final bell. The lights and fans often remain on because no one remembers to switch them off. This wastes electricity and increases electricity bills. Automation can help in such situations. If the classroom has an automated power system with a motion sensor, the lights will automatically turn off when no motion is detected. This simple change can save energy and reduce costs. Another example of automation is an automatic garden irrigation system, where a moisture sensor is installed in the soil. When the soil becomes too dry, the sensor sends a signal to a water pump. The pump then automatically turns on and waters your plants. Once the soil has enough moisture, the system turns the pump off. This saves you from having to check the garden every day and helps conserve water by watering plants only when needed. Automation is not a new idea—it has always been a part of our world. Nature had already perfected automation before humans started creating machines to automate tasks. Look at the human body. Without thinking about it, your heart beats automatically to pump blood, your lungs breathe in oxygen and release carbon dioxide, and your stomach digests food after eating. All these functions happen without conscious effort, just like an automated machine. The body uses signals, such as nerve impulses and hormones, to decide when and how to act, just as an intelligent system uses sensors and controllers. If we look around, nature itself is in automation mode. Like modern automation, nature follows systems that work independently, using signals and patterns. y Sunrise and Sunset: The sun rises and sets daily without any action on our part. y Water Cycle: Water evaporates from lakes and oceans, forms clouds, and falls back as rain, following a natural cycle."}

You want your circuit to switch the circuit ‘ON’ when it is dark or switch the electric pump ‘OFF’ when the tank is full. When it becomes dark at night, our eyes sense the darkness, or when water starts overflowing from a tank, our ears hear that sound. Our sensing organs are the eyes, ears, tongue, nose, and skin. They inform our brains about things happening around us. Now, to inform an electronic circuit that it needs to become automatic, it needs to sense things. This is done by components called ‘sensors’. How automation works? When we touch something hot, our skin senses the temperature (input). It sends a signal to our brain (process). Our brain signals our hand to move away from the hot object. A representation of how one brain senses an input and processes it into output in given in Figure 4.8. Skin senses temperature and informs brain.

The microcontroller is the brain of the circuit (Figure 4.8). It processes the sensor information and asks the output devices to act. You need to give instructions to get the desired response from the microcontrollers (Figure 4.9). This set of instructions given to the microcontroller is called a ‘programme’.

They make these predictions based on past data, assuming that similar trends will continue. Data is any information collected for a specific purpose in the form of facts, figures, photographs, videos, and so on (Figures 5.1 and 5.2). After collection, the data is organised so that we can interpret it and draw conclusions. For example, suppose we have data about temperature, humidity, and rainfall over a period of time. In that case, we can predict the chances of rain, given specific conditions of temperature and humidity. Imagine a village where farmers usually grow crops that need water. However, if past data on temperature and humidity show that a particular summer will be hotter and the rains will arrive late, the weather forecast can help them plan better. Instead of planting the usual crops, they can either delay sowing or choose crops that need less water. This way, they can avoid losses and better use their resources. In today’s age of information technology, data is considered an essential asset since it provides crucial information to make informed decisions. Data helps us in everyday life, for example, by estimating travel time or finding an allergy to some food in our diet. It enables government departments to plan water release schedules from dams, or prepare for traffic control during significant events.

You will conduct a water audit by systematically examining its uses and identifying sources of wastage. The data collected on water usage will be used to estimate water usage in different scenarios. To get accurate results, the data collected has to be correct and authentic (e.g., if you are collecting data on red cars passing a traffic signal in one hour, then a car of any other colour will not be included), reliable (e.g., even if two people are collecting data on red cars, they must come up with the same data), and obtained by experiment or from a source that can be trusted (e.g., before data collection, observers decide the colour will be considered red). This process will also prepare you to analyse different kinds of data. Water in India: A big challenge India has only four per cent of the world’s freshwater but nearly eighteen per cent of the world’s population. At the same time, water is not available equally everywhere in the country; some places face floods, while others experience droughts. Droughts are often seen as natural disasters, but in reality, they are primarily caused by human activities, such as deforestation, poor agricultural practices, and over-extraction of groundwater. They are also due to mismanagement and misuse of water at the micro (household) and macro (district/ state) levels. Did you know that leaving a tap running for five minutes can waste 45 litres of water? Are we using our water carefully? Or are some of us using water irresponsibly and wasting others’ share of water? Some people struggle to get water, depending on water tankers or walking long distances to fill a single bucket. At the same time, thousands of litres are wasted due to leaks and careless use."}

You can focus on areas that need immediate attention by identifying wastage points. Often, leakages need a little attention to fix them. Inspect common areas where water gets wasted, such as taps in your school or home, pipelines, or overhead tanks. Look for signs, like dripping taps (Figure 5.8), wet patches under pipes, or overflowing tanks. Record your findings in a notebook. Note down the location and type of problem. You can record the wastage of water by using a bucket and a stopwatch. 1. Start the stopwatch when water starts to waste. 2. Stop it when the wastage ends. 3. Note the time duration. 4.

Using a spanner, take off the tap’s cover to remove the handle. You will probably find this under the hot or cold sign. Undo the screw and remove the handle. If the tap has a metal cover, unscrew it by hand, or use a wrench or tap spanner. Unscrew the tap bonnet, and completely remove the headgear. You should see a large body washer, o-ring and jumper valve. The jumper valve should fall out. Replace the body washer, the o-ring and the jumper valve with new parts. Apply a tap lubricant to the spindle and valve for better sealing and smoother tap operation. Refit the bonnet and spindle. Be careful not to over-tighten the nuts. Put the tap back together, turn it off, and turn the water back on. Now, check the tap to make sure it is no longer leaking. Now, you can step back and admire the proper job done, knowing you are not wasting a drop. Figure 5.9: Steps to fix a leaking tap"}

Reduce the use of water: Most of us have a habit of opening the tap at full throttle. You can restrict the water flow per minute by using aerators or flow caps available in the market. You can also simply open the tap partially when using water (Figure 5.10). Full Tap Throttle With Flow cap With Aerator Figure 5.10: Comparison of water flow with and without flow cap and aerator Groundwater recharge You have learnt about groundwater in Science. As you know, well water and borewell water are essential water sources. One advantage of storing water underground is that evaporation losses are minimal. Unfortunately, due to uncontrolled groundwater extraction, water levels are depleting alarmingly. While many efforts are being made through various water conservation programmes, there are efforts that communities can make to help rainwater percolate into the ground. You can participate as volunteers in programmes around you. The basic principles of water conservation and an example of how they can be applied are: 1. To hold the water in the field: This can be done by making contour bunds on the ground (Figure 5.11). Contours are lines connecting points at equal elevation. Bunds, made up of earth to prevent water from running off the slope, on contour lines hold the water at the same level. This also helps in reducing soil erosion."}

It is possible to reuse the water by removing impurities. When water flows through the river, weeds like hyacinth absorb minerals that are mixed into water; oxygen mixed in water decomposes organic matter; and sunlight kills harmful bacteria. Through these natural processes, river water becomes clean when it flows. Wastewater from domestic use, like wastewater from sinks, baths, washing machines, and kitchens, is called greywater. Instead of letting this water go to waste, it can be reused for some purposes, such as irrigation, cleaning, or even groundwater recharge. As a part of our efforts to reuse water, you can try any of the following greywater recycling systems: 1. Wastewater from washing vegetables or cooking is used to water plants: Runoff water from a hand pump or a washing sink (to ensure the water is not too soapy) can be used to water the kitchen garden (Figure 5.14).

You know that a critical part of the chain is ensuring that sellers can reach buyers. Advertising plays a very important role in completing this part of the chain. However, the role of advertising is not limited to simply selling a product or service; it is also a means of communicating important social messages. Remember how you heard about a film that you wanted to see, a place you wanted to visit, something you wanted to eat or buy, just anything you wanted to do. Also, think about how you heard about campaigns, like the Swachh Bharat Mission or the polio vaccination drive. There are various ways of hearing about things from friends, family, books, magazines, newspapers, and social media–the list is long. Among this list are ‘advertisements’. Advertisements are meant to persuade you to do something. For example, a board outside a small shop describing its products is intended to tempt you to enter; sometimes, this job is done by persons outside the shop loudly describing their products. Another example is posters or clips on television or radio that urge citizens to keep their surroundings clean, to vaccinate themselves and their children, or to avail different services provided by the government, such as small savings schemes. Thus, advertising can be of two broad varieties–commercial and social, depending on the message conveyed. Did you know? The first few newspaper advertisements in India appeared in 1780 in the Bengal Gazette. In 1780, the first English language newspaper in India was published from Kolkata, known as Bengal Gazette. It was founded and edited by James Augustus Hicky. The Bengal Gazette was popularly referred to as Hicky’s Bengal Gazette. Figure 6.2 shows an advertisement for the well- known local hair oil ‘Jabakusum,’ which was published in the newspaper. Figure 6.2: An advertisement from late 18th century"}
{"class": "class 8", "subject": "vocational education", "page_no": 159, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "137 Creating Advertisements Historically, India had a system of informers who used to announce important messages by beating drums or dhindora, a practice popularly known as ‘Dhindhora Pitna’ in Hindi (Figure 6.3). Also called town criers, they would act as advertisers, announcing important messages in villages and informing people of the arrival of merchants and the goods they were carrying. This practice is similar to that of a person announcing events or promoting products/services using with a loudspeaker, moving around the city on a bike, auto rickshaw or jeep. Some of these practices continue to date, for example, door-to-door vendors use bells or shout out phrases to inform people of their arrival and the goods they offer. You may have also seen hand-painted signboards and murals conveying promotional messages in marketplaces (Figure 6.4). Street performances like ‘nukkad natak’ (street plays) and folk songs also increase awareness about products and services, and communicate social messages. However, even today, many people rely on word-of-mouth advertising, especially owners of small businesses that run out of homes or workshops, small retail shops and street vendors. For example, people from a town you visit will tell you—‘Buy sweets from this shop, mangoes from that, and traditional crafts from there’. Community gatherings and events during festivals (e.g., melas or fairs organised for the sale of different products) are also used to advertise products and services so that word-of-mouth advertising spreads. However, word-of-mouth advertising does not always work and is usually limited to a specific locality. Suppose someone can offer products and/or services distant from their immediate locality. In that case, they should be able to reach more people and get the opportunity to state exactly what is unique about their product and why people should prefer it over other products.

Respect the privacy and consent of small business owners when taking pictures or recording videos. 3. Be mindful of cultural sensitivities, and show respect towards the small business owners and their work. 4. Ethical advertising – It includes truthfulness, fairness and should be socially responsible. You should take care of the following: (a) Copyright: Ensure that you use original content, or if using someone else’s work (images, music, text), obtain permissions. Do not simply copy content from the Internet without mentioning the source. The process of copying content as such is called plagiarism. (b) Fake Advertising: Never make false claims about a product or service. Your advertisement should reflect the real features and benefits of the product. (c) Cultural and Gender Sensitivity: Avoid stereotypes or offensive content. Internet Safety: Ask your teachers for help while using the Internet. Be careful not to upload or download anything without permission; and do not share personal information anywhere. What do I need to know before I start?

You may have shared something with other students and teachers during classroom presentations or school assemblies. You can also invite your family members and others to see your work. You can do this through Kaushal Mela. But first, you must plan each detail carefully. Planning is essential since it helps you decide how to reach your goal. You must think about what needs to be done and when it needs to be done so that everything goes smoothly. For example, if you are planning a presentation on water usage in the community, you need to decide when and where, keeping in mind that the maximum number of people should watch it. Planning also helps prevent wastage of time and resources. For example, if you want to demonstrate the process of home automation, you must ensure that all the materials are available in one place in the correct quantity. Completing every activity at the given time is crucial for success. Different activities need different times for completion. Some materials need more time to procure, and some processes need more time than others. Further, some of the activities depend on others for completion. Therefore, plan in such a way that you will be able to achieve your goal. Since Kaushal Mela will involve a lot of planning and coordination, you must plan each detail carefully. Responsibilities must be assigned for each activity, and the process for each activity must be discussed in detail. You must also develop a plan to work together as a team. Table 7.1 below will help you plan for Kaushal Mela. Do add more details based on your discussions.

Time Allocation: The time allocated for each activity is a suggestion, and teachers can adjust it based on class size and the complexity of the project. Cross-curricular Connections: The projects can be drawn from other subjects in the Middle Stage—Language, Mathematics, Science, Social Science, Art Education and Physical Education and Well-being. This allows for a more holistic learning experience. Connection to other curricular areas is also indicated in the ensuing tables. Student Reflection: Reflection prompts are included (‘What did I learn?’, and ‘What else can I do?’) to encourage students to think critically about their work. Safety: The tables emphasise safety precautions (LO 6) for activities involving tools or potential hazards. Open-ended Learning: The ‘What else can I do?’ section (LO 18) encourages students to explore connecting to home and extend their learning. Learning Outcomes: Each project focuses on developing specific skills and knowledge (LO 1–11) along with essential values related to work (LO 12–17). Please note that LO 12–17, which refer to the essential values while working across areas, are applicable across all activities."}
