At the same time, it aims to prepare students to engage constructively with the opportunities and challenges of the 21st century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. By nurturing students’ inherent abilities across all the five planes of human existence (pañchakośhas), the Foundational and the Preparatory Stages set the stage for further learning at the Middle Stage. Spanning Grade 6 to Grade 8, the Middle Stage serves as a critical three-year bridge between the Preparatory and Secondary Stages. The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages — including at least two languages native to India — to Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education, promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas, as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy — a role that strikes a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, constituted for this"}

The Social Science textbook for Grade 8 — Exploring Society: India and Beyond, Part 1 — has been prepared for the final year of the Middle Stage. It carries forward the themes and approach of Grades 6 and 7; the focus is on core concepts and major developments. It endeavours to keep students engaged in learning through illustrations, maps, and pictures laid out in an attractive design. There are abundant reflective exercises and activities embedded in the text to support exploration, discovery, and meaning-making. The thematic approach with a multidisciplinary lens continues, helping students understand ideas and concepts holistically. The text integrates the values we desire our students to develop, is rooted in the Indian cultural context, and introduces global perspectives in an age-appropriate manner. For all practical purposes, it has, to my mind, succeeded in its curricular goals: first, to foster natural curiosity among students through a proper selection of content; and second, to employ a pedagogical approach in line with the recommendations of NCF-SE 2023. However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years.

In Social Science, this year we will explore more aspects of our country, India, across all five themes — India and the World: Land and the People, Tapestry of the Past, Our Cultural Heritage and Knowledge Traditions, Governance and Democracy, and Economic Life Around Us. You will encounter different types of people who lived in the past, their accomplishments and their mistakes, the impact they had on the economy, society and culture, and what they mean to us today. As you are older now, there will be a little more independent reading, writing and doing through reflective exercises and activities including some small research studies that you would need to take up. There is a little more text in the book as well. As with Grades 6 and 7, we have made ample use of colourful maps, pictures and illustrations, which we hope will help you to visualise better. Since good education should promote understanding and reflection, we have created opportunities for you to explore, discover, think, imagine, create, ask questions and propose answers. You will notice how each theme brings together multiple inputs from several disciplines — not only history, geography, political science or economics, but also art, literature and science. This brings us closer to real life and helps us understand the events of today. In short, you will observe that the threads of the past continue to be part of today’s tapestry and give us the design for strengthening it for tomorrow. Given India’s rich past and enormous dimensions — both geographical and human — we were very eager to share a lot with you; deciding what to include and what to leave out led to arguments and heartaches, because all those involved wanted to give you the best.

By now, you are more confident in studying Social Science and are ready to go deeper. This year, our journey will take us on an exploration and reflection on natural resources and how we use them, the tapestry of our past as political and cultural transformations took place, and how we have organised the functioning of our democracy through our electoral process. Together we'll continue asking important questions about how societies organise themselves, how resources become products, and how citizens participate in governance. This textbook has interesting features. As you flip through it, you will see colourful illustrations, including pictures, maps and drawings of many kinds. Let us give you a quick tour of the book and its features. Your teacher will also guide you through it. Each chapter begins with an inspiring quotation from a renowned person or text. Read it and let it stay with you. Some of these quotations are profound thoughts.

But we will also encounter some words in Sanskrit and a few other Indian languages. The Roman alphabet cannot make their pronunciation clear without some additional marks or signs, such as dashes, dots or accents, called ‘diacritical signs’ or ‘diacritics’. You can ignore all these signs if you wish, and you don’t need to remember them. However, as we are using only a few simple signs, you will find it easy to get used to them. You will also find that they help you pronounce Sanskrit words fairly correctly. (Please note that for proper names, we have used diacritics only up to 1200 CE, not afterwards.) Here is how they work:  A short dash (called ‘macron’) over a vowel makes it long. For instance, dāna is pronounced ‘daana’; līlā is pronounced ‘leelaa’; sūtra is sootra.  śh and ṣh are pronounced more or less as ‘sh’ in ‘shall’ (there is a slight difference, since they correspond to श and ष in the Devanagari script, but you can ignore it in practice). So śhāstra is pronounced ‘shaastra’; kṣhīra is ‘ksheera’.  Consonants with a dot below them (ḍ, ṭ and ṇ mainly) are ‘hard’, i.e. pronounced by hitting the tongue on the palate; without a dot, they"}

(As a rough comparison, in the preceding English word ‘teeth’, the first ‘t’ is hard, while the final ‘th’ is soft.) Examples of hard consonants: Āryabhaṭa, gaṇa, paṭhana (studying), pīṭha, goṣṭhī (association, assembly), dhanāḍhya (rich), aṇu (atom).  Finally, ṛ is the Devanagari letter :. We choose to write it as ṛi, although in some parts of India it is also pronounced as ṛu. So we write ‘Ṛig Veda’, for instance. For those who wish to know the precise correspondence between the Devanagari alphabet and the Roman script in our system, the tables of short and long vowels are as follows: Devanagari Roman script 4 a 6 i 8 u : ṛi > e B o Devanagari Roman script 5 ā 7 ī 9 ū  ṝi ? ai C au And the table of consonants: Guttural D ka E kha F ga G gha H ṅa h ha Palatal I cha J chha K ja L jha M ña ^ ya Cerebral N ṭa O ṭha P ḍa Q ḍha R ṇa _ ra Dental S ta T tha U da V dha W na a la Labial Y pa Z pha [ ba \\ bha ] ma d va Sibilants श śha ष ṣha g sa"}

One of the meanings of the word ‘Nature’ is the totality of life and non-life forms that are part of our environment but have not been created by humans. When humans use these for their sustenance, or create new things from them for consumption, these elements of Nature become ‘resources’. For example, trees are part of the environment; they exist independently of humans. When we cut them and convert their wood into furniture, we see the trees as a resource. Often these entities are not easily accessible. For example, there may be petroleum in places deep under the ocean that we do not have the technology to access, or the extraction cost may be too high; or it may be culturally unacceptable like cutting trees in sacred groves. So, for an entity to be called a resource, it should be technologically accessible, and its exploitation should be economically feasible and culturally acceptable. (Usually, the word ‘exploitation’ has a negative connotation; in the context we use it here, it means ‘extraction, utilisation and consumption of Natural resources’.) The Earth has treasures, many of which have formed over millions of years, and which humans have taken and learnt to use.

This is a simple example of categories. We do the same with natural resources. THINK ABOUT IT What might be the different criteria we can use to categorise natural resources? One of the ways we could categorise natural resources is based on the uses we put them to — essential for our life, source for materials and sources for energy. Resources essential for life Life could not exist on Earth without the air we breathe, the water we drink and the food we eat. We take these from the atmosphere, the rivers and ponds, and through the cultivation of soil or other living things. We cannot make the air we breathe, the water we drink, or the soil which gives us food. Resources for materials Human beings create physical objects out of Nature’s gifts. We make them for our utility or to create things of beauty that enrich our lives and those of others ― a piece of wood can be transformed into a chair and also carved into a statuette. India’s geographical diversity provides us with a wide variety of natural resources, from wood to marble, and coal to gold.

A general principle of Nature is that it functions in a restorative and regenerative way. Restoration is the process of returning something to its original healthy state if it has been degraded or damaged. Nature heals, renews and maintains herself over time. A cut on your skin will normally heal; a forest recovers after a wildfire. Regeneration goes beyond restoration. It is about Nature’s ability to create new life and the conditions for thriving. We plant trees in areas that may have lost them on account of human interventions like clearing forests for housing. Planting the types of trees that were originally growing there restores the ecosystem — the trees provide food and shelter for birds, squirrels and other creatures, enabling life to return. Nature works in cycles where there is no waste. Take a forest. Let’s say a tree falls in the forest. It decomposes with the bacteria, fungi and insects feeding on it. The tree becomes part of the soil enriching it. New trees and plants grow from seeds … eventually some will fall and the cycle starts again. These are examples of Nature’s principle of restoration and regeneration in practice. Renewable resources Renewable resources exhibit these characteristics over time. Most of India has abundant sunshine. In the natural course, rivers are Fig. 1.7. River water, a renewable resource as long as glaciers and forests exist Fig. 1.8.

Solar energy, wind energy, energy from flowing water, timber from forests are renewable resources as long as we are able to manage them in a sustainable manner. However, for them to remain renewable there is a condition — the natural rhythm of restoration and regeneration must not be disturbed. If we harvest timber faster than the forest can grow trees, we will eventually deplete the forest. Scientists have shown that through irresponsible human actions, many of Nature’s cycles have been disturbed. A combination of several factors interacting — fossil fuel-driven industrialisation and the cutting down of forests for agriculture and other purposes are two of them — has led to rising temperatures that we are experiencing; on account of this, the glaciers in some places in the Himalayas are melting at a rate faster than precipitation can replace them. This has implications on water security for the populations living in the plains dependent on the ‘water tower’.

However, the commercialisation of fishing resulted in over-fishing.

Frequently, economies are unable to develop industries that convert the resources into products of higher value; the chapter ‘Factors of Production’ in the latter part of this book will give you an understanding of this.

Scientists studying these aspects have warned that the irresponsible treatment of natural resources has led to pollution, biodiversity loss and climate change, which has been taking place at an increased pace in recent years. Restoration and regeneration of renewable resources Here are two examples of how we are pushing the use of natural resources beyond their capacity to regenerate. Many farmers in our country extract groundwater for irrigation purposes. In most states, the extraction rate is greater than the rate at which the water table is replenished. Over time, this deficit builds up, leading to higher cost of extraction of groundwater and eventually to its unavailability. It has been predicted that many of our growing cities will run out of groundwater soon. Initiatives to raise groundwater levels have been launched to remedy this. Traditional practices of water harvesting, rejuvenation of ponds and tanks, cutting down on wasteful consumption of water, processing and reusing water are some of the strategies attempted. Similarly, the improper use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides has led to soil degradation. Tradi- tional farming practices considered soil to be part of Mother Earth. Practices like the use of cow dung and other natural fertilisers, mulching, multi-cropping, and so on, enabled holistic soil management.

Overexploitation of groundwater: a caselet from Punjab A crisis has unfolded in the fertile plains of Punjab where groundwater resources have been severely depleted. Punjab was home to the Green Revolution that fed a large proportion of our population, and contributed to India becoming self-sufficient in food. Today the same state faces issues of sustainability — Nature has been exploited beyond regeneration, at least in the short term. However, this concern is not particular to Punjab; it affects many other states. In the 1960s, farmers shifted to high-yielding varieties of wheat and paddy. These required more water than the traditional seeds, and farmers began to extract groundwater to meet this need. In addition, the supply of free power led to the over-pumping of groundwater (a situation still prevalent in much of India today). Modern farming techniques also required the use of chemical pesticides and fertilisers. The combined effect of these factors is that the groundwater level in a large part of Punjab (see fig. 1.17) has become inaccessible till depths of about 30 metres; and the chemicals from the pesticides and fertilisers have dissolved in the groundwater causing health hazards.

But while every country may have had such peaceful eras and some benevolent rulers, history seems peopled by incompetent, corrupt or cruel rulers. We find them especially in what we may call the darker chapters or periods of history, when war, abuse, fanaticism, bloodshed, etc., suddenly dominate the landscape and inflict suffering and misery on the whole society or country. The world over, historians have faced this dilemma: how much attention should we draw to such darker periods? Should we omit them entirely? Should we mention them in passing, with most atrocious details left out? Or should we face them and analyse them so as to understand what made such developments possible and, hopefully, help avoid their recurrence in future? The third option is, in our opinion, the best, if it can be done with enough detachment and sensitivity; it is important to know our past, pleasant or unpleasant, since the past continues to live with us and shapes the present. What do we mean by ‘detachment and sensitivity’? Simply that it is important to study those darker developments dispassionately, without blaming anyone living today for them. For instance, you will learn later that World War II (1939–1945) resulted in millions of deaths worldwide; Germany then followed a cruel ideology (known as ‘Nazism’) which believed in the extermination of ‘inferior races’ and resulted in the inhuman treatment of some ethnic groups and a brutal rule of occupied nations. Yet it would be clearly unacceptable to blame today’s Germans for what happened over eight decades ago. Rather, what matters is to understand what made the Nazi ideology possible, so that similar ideologies today or tomorrow may be defeated. The same principle applies to the ‘Tapestry of the Past’ chapters in this textbook, which include passages on warfare and instances of cruelty or brutality. While those happenings cannot be erased or denied, it would be wrong to hold anyone today responsible for them. Understanding the historical origin of cruel violence, abusive misrule or misplaced ambitions of power is the best way to heal the past and build a future where, hopefully, they will have no place."}

This Sultanate saw the rule of five successive foreign dynasties of Turkic-Afghan origin — the Mamluks (or ‘Slave dynasty’), the Khiljis (or Khaljis), the Tughlaqs, the Sayyids, and the Lodis (or Lodhis). While certain parts of northern India came under the control of the Delhi Sultanate, neighbouring kingdoms, such as the Eastern Gangas in the east and the Hoysalas in the south resisted its advance (Fig. 2.3) and also emerged as thriving centres of art, culture, and administration. The city of Delhi also assumed a bigger role in the political landscape of northern India. The Sultanate period was marked by political instability combined with efforts at territorial expansion. This resulted in military campaigns that raided villages and cities, and plundered Sultanate: A territory ruled by a ‘Sultan’ — a title that some Muslim rulers adopted. Fig. 2.4. The Qutub Minar.

At the turn of the 14th century, Ala-ud-din Khilji conducted military campaigns over large areas of north and central India, sacking and plundering many cities; at the same time, he also repelled several invasions by Mongol forces, who were trying to add India to the vast Mongol Empire (it covered most of Asia at the time). His slave-general Malik Kafur expanded the Sultanate’s reach southward, conquering several kingdoms on the way; their plundered wealth helped finance the Sultanate’s enormous military apparatus. He also attacked a number of Hindu centres such as Srirangam, Madurai, Chidambaram, and possibly Rameswaram.

Although this dominance was significant, it proved to be short-lived. Muhammad bin Tughlaq had ambitious schemes, but they were often poorly executed. One such was moving his capital from Delhi to Daulatabad (then called ‘Devagiri’, near present-day Sambhaji Nagar); perhaps he thought its more central location would offer better control of the empire. The people were forced to travel over 1,000 km, and a few years later, as his plan misfired, he shifted the capital back to Delhi; both transfers resulted in great loss of life according to some sources. Another instance was the introduction of ‘token currency’, where cheap copper coins were declared to be tokens and have the value of silver or gold coins — although this was a progressive idea (most of our currency today is actually ‘token’), at the time this created confusion in the trade and encouraged people to counterfeit copper coins, all of which caused the economy to decline. The sultans and their court elite lived in luxurious palaces, enjoying elaborate clothing, jewelled ornaments and fine food. This wealth was largely derived from plunder from their military campaigns, taxes levied on common people and conquered regions, and engagement in slave trade (as enslaved people Fig. 2.7.

But plunder, in turn, affected trade networks and agricultural production. This period also witnessed numerous attacks on sacred or revered images in Buddhist, Jain and Hindu temples; such destruction was motivated not just by plunder but also by iconoclasm. THINK ABOUT IT Why do we use the term ‘image’ rather than common terms like ‘idol’ or ‘icon’? The latter two terms are considered pejorative in the context of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, whose orthodox sects condemn ‘idolatry’ or the worship of ‘idols’ or ‘icons’. India’s classical texts used words like mūrti, vigraha, pratimā, rūpa, etc., to designate images, often statues, used for worship in temples or homes. In English, ‘image’ is a neutral term. Some of the sultans also imposed the jizya, a tax on non- Muslim subjects to grant them protection and exemption from military service. In practice, depending on the ruler, this discriminatory tax would be a source of economic burden and public humiliation, and formed a financial and social incentive for subjects to convert to Islam. At the end of the 14th century, Timur, a brutal Turkic-Mongol conqueror from central Asia, invaded northwest India and launched a devastating attack on Delhi, then a thriving city. As he wrote in his memoirs, his two-fold objective was to wage “war with the infidels and to gain something by plundering the wealth of the infidels.” Large numbers were killed or enslaved, and the city was left in ruins. Timur soon withdrew from India with huge plunder, leaving chaos behind. In the aftermath, the Lodis emerged and established the last dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate. By then, however, its territory had shrunk considerably in the face of increasing resistance from other states and kingdoms from within India (see Fig. 2.3).

In early conquests, following many of his predecessors’ examples, he showed no mercy at the fort Chittor (or Chittorgarh, in Rajasthan), which he besieged for more than five months in the face of determined resistance from the Rajput soldiers. They inflicted heavy losses on the Mughal army, but, the fort finally breached, died fighting in large numbers, while hundreds of women committed jauhar (see box). Akbar ordered the massacre of some 30,000 civilians, and the surviving women and children were enslaved. Akbar was 25 at the time, and he sent a message of victory which read, “We have succeeded in occupying a number of forts and towns belonging to the infidels and have established Islam there. With the help of our bloodthirsty sword, we have erased the signs of infidelity from their minds and have destroyed temples in those places and also all over Hindustan.” Akbar followed his predecessors in this thought of his: “A monarch should be ever intent on conquest, otherwise his enemies rise in arms against him.” As his empire grew (Fig. 2.16), he increasingly used political strategies to stabilise it; he entered into marriage alliances with princesses of neighbouring kingdoms, welcomed Rajput and regional leaders into his court, abolished the jizya, and promoted the doctrine of sulh-i- kul — literally, ‘peace with all’ or tolerance of all faiths. Through interfaith dialogues, appointment What is jauhar? When invading Turkic or Mughal armies conquered a territory, they often took the women as slaves or abused them.

Thus, when Akbar finally broke into the Chittorgarh Fort, hundreds of Rajput women, led by their queens and noblewomen, committed jauhar."}

Aurangzeb had to spend the last 25 years of his life fighting war after war in the Deccan. Maintaining large armies for those campaigns depleted the empire’s treasury and put a great strain on the administration; indeed, this is often considered one of key factors in the rapid decline of Mughal power after Aurangzeb’s death in 1707. Aurangzeb, who belonged to Islam’s Sunni sect, was deeply religious; he led an austere life, and, unlike Akbar, observed all religious rituals and occasions. He gradually banned practices he regarded as un-Islamic, such as music and dance in his court, and reimposed the jizya tax on non-Muslims as well as a pilgrimage tax on Hindus travelling to their sacred places (both of which had been abolished by Akbar)."}

She kept an army of 20,000 soldiers and 1,000 elephants, with which she repelled several attempted invasions. When a general sent by Akbar attacked her kingdom in 1564, despite being outnumbered and outmatched in weaponry, she led her troops and fought bravely.

Till the mid-19th century, this empire resisted both Mughal remnants and later British expansion. Administering India Administration under the Delhi Sultanate The Delhi Sultanate introduced a political system centred on the sultan, who possessed absolute authority as the political and military head, and whose duties, according to contemporary chronicles, included “defending the territories of Islam against possible aggression,” “collecting fees and taxes” and “keeping in touch with public affairs and the condition of the people by personal contact.” The sultan was however assisted by a council of ministers who were in charge of the various departments of the Sultanate. One instrument of the administration was the iqta system, in which territories were assigned to nobles (iqtadars) to collect taxes which, minus expenses, were supposed to go to the Sultan’s treasury; they were needed, in particular, to maintain the army. The system created a network of local administrators loyal to the central authority, but their posts were not hereditary. While taxes were levied on trade at every stage, the burden fell most heavily on the peasantry, and some contemporary accounts report considerable cruelty in extracting revenue from the land. The Mughal administrative framework Aiming at greater control and efficiency, Akbar reorganised his administrative machinery. The Diwan took care of the finances, while the Mir Bakhshi looked after military matters and the Khan-i-Saman was in charge of public works, trade, industry and agriculture, besides the royal household. The Sadr was responsible for justice, religious and educational matters. Such ministers were assigned to each of the empire’s twelve provinces (subahs), which were further subdivided, with effective checks and balances enforced between the government officials. At the village level, traditional structures of self-governance continued more or less undisturbed."}

This made it possible to assemble an army at a short notice without having to maintain a permanent centralised army. Regular inspections were carried out to ensure compliance. Mansabdars were generally paid by being assigned land (jagirs) and were therefore also known as jagirdars. Despite Akbar’s growing tolerance for different faiths, non-Muslims were kept in a minority in the higher echelons of the administration; for instance, the total percentage of non- Muslim officials in his Fig. 2.28.

We will see a different kind of administration, that of the Marathas, in the next chapter. People’s Lives Despite shifting political powers between the 13th and 17th centuries, India witnessed vibrant economic activity, thanks to its agrarian foundations, thriving artisanal industries, community-based and temple-based economies, and extensive trade networks. Building on decentralised economic and social systems — such as śhreṇis (guilds), jātis (professionally defined communities), and systems for credit — the Subcontinent remained one of the wealthiest regions in the world.

The expansion of irrigation systems increased agricultural productivity, allowing for the production of multiple crops, including both food (rice, wheat, barley, pulses, sugarcane, spices, etc.) and non-food items (cotton, which fed a thriving textile production, silk, wool, dyes, timber, jute, etc.). Let us note that agriculture output varied from region to region and period to period; the peasantry suffered several severe famines in this period, with relief depending upon the particular ruler’s benevolence. Apart from textiles, craftspeople made a wide range of products, from weapons to utensils to ornaments and jewellery items. Ship-building, essential to river and overseas trade, developed considerably in those centuries. Indian goods were exported through coastal and riverside towns such as Calicut, Mangalore, Surat, Masulipatnam or Hooghly. India imported much less than it exported; import products included silk, horses, metals, and all kinds of luxury goods. Merchants from Arabia, Persia (now Iran), and Central Asia settled in Indian ports, contributing to the bustling trade activity. The hundi system also enabled merchants to transfer funds across political boundaries without physically transporting currency, making them less vulnerable to plunder. Trader communities, such as the Marwaris, became adept at operating across different political regimes, developing parallel systems of credit and trust that functioned independently of official structures.

These systems worked across trade networks without the participation of the ruling classes. Temples as centres of economic activity Many temples were more than centres for worship, learning, social interaction or performing arts. They also created ecosystems with bustling markets; ruling classes donated land and wealth (dāna) to temple deities, held in trust by temple managers who developed community infrastructure (irrigation systems, tanks, etc.) and pilgrim accommodations (dharmaśhālās and chhatrams). Temples provided merchants with credit and funded internal as well as maritime trade. While early periods saw prosperity, the late 1600s witnessed economic stress. Peasants were often left with a small share of their produce after taxes and payments to intermediary parties. This caused many to lose their land and become bonded labourers. Historians suggest that craftspeople and labourers, too, often faced harsh economic conditions. India was still a land of abundance, as testified by many Arab and European travellers, but the wealth was largely concentrated in the hands of the rulers, courtiers, high officials and the merchant class. Frequent warfare, in addition, caused forced displacement of population. At the level of the common people, there were instances of clashes, especially over sacred sites that had been desecrated or destroyed under the rulers’ sanction.

They helped translate important texts like the Upaniṣhads and the Bhagavad Gītā into Marathi, making their philosophy accessible to the people. Some also focused on social organisation and political awareness, similar to the Sikh gurus. As a result, the society acquired a solid cultural foundation, which later helped the Marathas to organise themselves into a political power. By the 17th century, some Maratha chiefs made early attempts at establishing sovereignty, but they proved unsuccessful — until Shivaji rose to power and brought the Marathas together. But who was Shivaji? Foundation of Maratha Power and the Rise of Shivaji In 16 30, Shivaji was born in the Bhonsle clan to Shahji and Jijabai. At the time, Shahji served the Deccan sultanates and was often away from his family. Meanwhile, in his jāgīr at Pune, Shivaji grew up under the watchful eyes of Jijabai and some trusted officials, receiving values and a good education. At this time, the Pune region was deeply affected by constant infighting between the Deccan sultans whom the Marathas served, which caused much hardship for the common people. When he was just 16, Shivaji launched military campaigns, first consolidating his hold over the Pune region by capturing neglected and unoccupied forts and strengthening their defences. His vision of a sovereign kingdom or ‘Swarājya’ grew over the years, extending to political, economic and cultural aspects, which we will explore in this chapter. Fig. 3.5. A painting of Shivaji made in the 1680s (British Museum) Jāgīr: A jāgīr was a piece of land given by a king or ruler to someone (usually a noble or soldier) as a reward for their service.

By com parison, the Bijapur Sultanate (ruled by the Adil Shahi dynasty), maintained merchant ships but did not possess a full- time naval force which could protect the coast; even the Mughal Empire’s use of a navy was very limited. Thus, the Maratha Navy was born, whose exploits became legendary. To protect his people from powerful enemies, Shivaji had recourse to the tactic of guerrilla warfare, which uses small groups of people in a focused way, with speed, surprise, and knowledge of the terrain to defeat bigger armies. His successes soon invited the wrath of the Bijapur Sultanate, which sent the veteran general Afzal Khan to confront him. Shivaji and his advisers managed to convince Afzal Khan to meet him for a one-on-one meeting at the foot of the Pratapgad fort amid thick forests. There, Shivaji killed Afzal Khan, and the Marathas, hidden in the mountains, routed the Khan’s army with guerrilla attacks.

Soon afterwards, the Mughal nobleman Shaista Khan invaded Shivaji’s territories with a big army for three years. Finally, with only a few soldiers, Shivaji raided Shaista Khan’s camp at night. The Khan barely escaped from the raid, losing a few fingers, and promptly left Maharashtra. This daring raid resembles the modern-day surgical strike. As a retaliatory action for the three-year-long wave of attacks, Shivaji sacked Surat, a wealthy port city of the Mughal Empire (in present-day Gujarat). There, he obtained enormous treasure worth almost one crore of rupees, an extremely large sum for the time. However, he was careful not to attack religious places and even spared the house of Mohandas Parekh, a charitable man. He sacked Surat again after a few years. These events became so famous that they appeared in the London Gazette, an English newspaper of the time, which conveyed how Shivaji wrote to all European diplomatic agents in Surat, demanding ‘immediate presents of money’, failing which he would ‘return and ruin that city’. The sacking of Surat was a great insult to the might and prestige of the Mughal Empire. Therefore, Aurangzeb sent Jai Singh, a distinguished Rajput general, to defeat Shivaji. Against him, Shivaji had to concede defeat at Purandar Fort (near Pune) and enter into a treaty. He had to give up a sizeable part of his kingdom, and his son Sambhaji had to enter Mughal service.

To escape this, Shivaji devised a strategy — he started distributing gifts to holy men and Mughal generals. The gifts often contained fruits and sweets, packed in big baskets. The guards initially checked them, but soon stopped doing so; expecting this, Shivaji and his son Sambhaji hid themselves in the baskets and made their escape. Aurangzeb could never capture Shivaji again. Fig. 3.8.

He was a master strategist and a true visionary, and within his lifetime, his exploits had become legendary across India and beyond. The Europeans compared him with ancient generals like Alexander, and the Bundela prince Chhatrasal was so inspired by Shivaji’s struggle against the Mughals that he managed to create an independent kingdom of Bundelkhand (divided between present-day Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh). The famous Hindi poet Bhushan specifically came to Maharashtra to meet Shivaji and composed poems in his praise, some of which remain famous to this day. LET’S EXPLORE Pick an event from Shivaji’s life and, with your classmates, stage it as a play. The Marathas after Shivaji Shivaji had two sons — Sambhaji and Rajaram. After Shivaji’s death, Sambhaji became the Chhatrapati. The Marathas were then the only obstacle to total Mughal control of the Deccan. Aurangzeb invaded the Deccan and conquered the Bijapur (or Adil Shahi) and Golconda (or Qutb Shahi) Sultanates. He then captured Sambhaji and, after torturing him brutally, executed him. After this, he captured Raigad, the Maratha capital. After Sambhaji, Rajaram became the Chhatrapati and fled to Gingee (in present-day Tamil Nadu). The Mughal-Maratha conflict thus spread to south India. The Marat has staunchly defended their fortresses and often had the upper hand over the Mughals in battles and skirmishes. Aurangzeb was thus unable to leave the Deccan and died without having succeeded in subduing the Marathas, who emerged as a strong contender to the Mughals. No longer on the defensive, the Marathas led by Tarabai, Rajaram’s queen, made large-scale inroads into Mughal territories, eventually conquering large parts of India. During this rapid expansion, the Marathas themselves under- went a structural transformation. The centralised state from Shivaji’s time gave way to a more decentralised structure,"}

In particular, the Peshwa (a Persian term for ‘prime minister’) wielded great influence, even over the Chhatrapati himself. In particular, Peshwa Bajirao I and his son Nanasaheb Peshwa were instrumental in the pan-Indian expansion of the Marathas. The Marathas brought large parts of India (Fig. 3.11) under their control and generally ruled them well. But with the regional chiefs acquiring more power and autonomy, this also resulted in occasional indiscipline and abuse, in stark contrast with Shivaji’s values. For instance, the Marathas’ ten-year campaign in Bengal inflicted much cruelty and devastation on the common people. In their northward expansion, the Marathas briefly controlled the areas of Lahore, Attock and even Peshawar (in modern-day Pakistan). They fought with the Afghans, and despite suffering a disastrous defeat at Panipat in 1761, they quickly recovered during the time of Peshwa Madhavrao I. Under the leadership of Mahadji Shinde (also known as Mahadji Scindia), they went on to recapture Delhi in 1771, which remained under their control till the British captured it three decades later. In the latter half of the 18th century, the chief rivals of the British in India were the Marathas. Three Anglo-Maratha wars (as they are called) were fought between 1775 and 1818. Owing to the Marathas’ increased internal disunity and the superior organisational and technological abilities of the British, they succeeded in ending the Maratha power. In effect, the British took India from the Marathas more than from the Mughals or any other power. Fig. 3.10.

Maratha Administration Civilian administration Shivaji instituted a relatively centralised administration for his kingdom. He abolished the hereditary posts (generally practised under the Sultans or the Mughals) and land assignments and paid a salary to every government official out of the state treasury. Many officials were periodically transferred as well, ensuring that they would not have enough power to dictate terms to the king.

If needed, secure permission for cutting the trees from the forest and then proceed. Other trees like the mango and jackfruit are also useful, but do not touch them. Because such trees take many years to mature, and the people look after them like their children. If you cut them, will their sorrow ever end?

In return, the Marathas protected those provinces and did not intervene in their internal administration. The Mughals also approved of this arrangement through various treaties, and over time, some of these provinces became a part of the Maratha Empire. DON’T MISS OUT In the 18th century, the Marathas often adopted the Mughal style of coinage owing to its popularity, but added their own cultural symbols to it. For instance, this rare Maratha coin known as the ‘Gaṇapatī-Pantapradhān rupee’, minted in the early 19th century by the Patwardhans (generals under the Peshwa), features inscriptions in two scripts — Devanagari and Persian. One side is an invocation to Gaṇapati (Gaṇeśha) while the other declares loyalty to the Peshwa (often referred to as ‘Pantapradhān’ in Marathi). Fig. 3.15. Military administration The Maratha armed forces were divided into three parts — infantry, cavalry and navy. The cavalry was made up of two types of soldiers — the bārgīrs, whose horses and equipment were paid for by the state, and the shiledārs, whose horses and equipment were paid for by the soldiers themselves. In the 18th century, the Marathas also noticed the superiority of European- style disciplined troops and artillery, and they tried to raise and recruit such troops. In particular, Mahadji Shinde had a large European-style army. Swords and lances were the preferred weapons of the Marathas (Fig. 3.16). However, they also used guns in sizable numbers. Rockets were used in military campaigns from the days of Shivaji himself, and by 1770, metal tube rockets were also being used."}

Ramachandrapant Amatya, the finance minister of Shivaji, in his work Ādnyāpatra (‘The Royal Edict’) explains, Fig. 3.16. Some of the weapons used by the Marathas. Maritime supremacy As we saw, Shiva ji created a navy to secure the west coast. In the 18th century, Kanhoji Angre guided the Marathas to victory in many naval battles, thanks to a clever use of geography and battle tactics, despite the Maratha ships not being as techno- logically advanced as the European ones. At the time, the main strength of Europeans in India was their navies. They forced Indians to purchase their naval trade passes (cartaz in Portuguese) at a price; any ship without a pass was confiscated. The Marathas challenged this practice and started demanding passes from the Europeans themselves — who showed their frustration by labelling Kanhoji Angre a ‘pirate’! “Forts are the core of the state. In their absence, the land gets devastated in the face of an invasion. Therefore, all the former kings secured the country by building forts. This kingdom (Maratha kingdom) was created by the late great master [Shivaji] from forts alone … A great enemy like Aurangzeb invaded [this kingdom], conquered great empires like Bijapur and Bhaganagar [… but] it was due to forts that the [Maratha] state survived despite decades of onslaught.”"}

In places such as Odisha in the 18th century, a network of ferries was maintained for riverine transport. Bridges were built over rivers and small streams. Cultural Revival The Marathas contributed substantially to India’s cultural developments. Shivaji’s vision of Swarājya is evident in his seal, which carried a Sanskrit inscription, a notable departure from the prevalent Persian seals — “This seal (i.e. authority) of Shivaji, the son of Shahji, waxing like the new moon, revered by the world, reigns for the welfare (of the people).” Shivaji also commissioned a treatise called Rājya-Vyavahāra- Koṣha with the aim of promoting the Marathi language; it provided Sanskrit equivalents for the prevalent Persian words used in diplomatic exchanges, as a result of which, the percentage of foreign loanwords in Maratha diplomacy decreased considerably. Shivaji was a devout Hindu who respected other religions while upholding his own. His saffron-coloured flag was adopted by all Marathas. He rebuilt desecrated temples, promoted Sanskrit and Marathi literature, religious institutions, and traditional arts. But perhaps he contributed most to the revival of ancient Indian culture and values by giving people a demonstration that mighty kingdoms and empires could be defeated, and the Marathas could maintain, expand and administer an empire of their own.

As you will discover in higher grades, European powers — in particular, Spain, Portugal, Britain, France, and Netherlands — established colonies across Africa, Asia, the Americas, Australia and many Pacific islands, after conquering large parts of those regions of the world. Often, the conquests were achieved through military campaigns that involved the massacre or enslavement of native populations. What impelled those nations to undertake such campaigns? Political competition between European powers created a race for territorial expansion and global influence. Territorial expansion had obvious economic advantages: access to new natural resources, new markets and new trade routes — and, often, plunder, as we will see.

Indian goods — spices, cotton, ivory, gems, sandalwood, teakwood, wootz steel, among other commodities — were highly sought after in the Mediterranean world. Until the 16th century CE, when European powers began sailing to the Indian Subcontinent, India was a vibrant economic and cultural powerhouse. Historical estimates (by economist Angus Maddison, in particular) suggest that India contributed at least one-fourth of the world GDP during this whole period, making it one of the two largest economies globally alongside China (whose contribution was of the same order). It is remarkable that from the 16th century onward, many European travellers to India described her as ‘flourishing’ and noted her manufacturing capabilities, diverse agricultural output, and extensive internal as well as external trading networks. However, this economic prosperity also made India an attractive target for European colonial ambitions. Let us survey Europe’s first colonial powers in India.

The Portuguese captured strategic ports, including Goa (in 1510), which became the capital of their colony in India, as well as several trading posts along the Malabar and Coromandel coasts. The Portuguese implemented a system known as cartaz (pass), requiring all ships in the Arabian Sea to purchase Portuguese permits for navigation. Ships without these permits were seized. This naval dominance allowed them to monopolise the spice trade between India and Europe for nearly a century. Alongside commercial exploitation, the Portuguese presence in western India was characterised by religious persecution. In Goa, they established the Inquisition in 1560, which severely persecuted Hindus, Muslims, Jews, and Christian converts suspected of practising their original faith.

This battle was a rare instance of an Asian power successfully repelling a European colonial force. The French: colonial ambitions The French entered India later, establishing their first trading post at Surat in 1668 and subsequently at Pondicherry (present- day Puducherry) in 1674, where they established their East India Company (Compagnie des Indes Orientales) and developed ambitious plans to establish a French empire in India. Dupleix, who served as Governor-General of French India from 1742 to 1754, pioneered several colonial strategies that would later be adopted by the British. In particular, he trained Indian soldiers in European military techniques, creating disciplined infantry soldiers known as sepoys. Dupleix also developed the strategy of indirect rule through puppet Indian rulers, who were installed through interventions in local succession disputes. The French colonial ambitions in India were ultimately checked during the Carnatic Wars (1746–1763), a series of conflicts between Britain and France. Despite initial successes under Dupleix, who captured Madras (present-day Chennai) in 1746, the French ultimately lost ground to the British and their colony was reduced to Pondicherry and a few smaller enclaves. Like the Dutch, and unlike the Portuguese, the French colonial powers did not much intervene in Indians’ social and religious life. A rare exception was the destruction in 1748 of Pondicherry’s large Vedapurishwaran temple, ordered by Dupleix on the persistent request of Pondicherry’s Jesuit priests and Dupleix’s own wife, with a view to asserting the dominance of Christianity. Generally, however, the French had to be content with a modest amount of trade with India."}

Unlike classic conquests, the British takeover of India was gradual, calculated, and often disguised as commercial enterprise rather than military invasion. The English East India Company was established as a trading company and was granted a royal charter by Queen Elizabeth I, which gave it special powers — to raise a private army, for instance. Nevertheless, its agents initially kept up a pretence of being mere traders, which allowed them, in the 17th century, to establish footholds along India’s coast with minimal resistance: Surat, Madras, Bombay and Calcutta among the first. Local rulers did not mind these trading posts, as they generally welcomed foreign trade (which, let us recall, was a longstanding practice in India). These modest beginnings concealed the Company’s long- term ambitions. LET US EXPLORE Before you read further, have a good look at the painting on the first page of this chapter.

The British were equally skilled at exploiting existing divisions within Indian society: they identified and often encouraged tensions between religious communities, for instance. The Battle of Plassey (1757) exemplifies this approach. When tensions arose between Siraj-ud-daulah, the Nawab of Bengal, and the East India Company officials led by Robert Clive, the latter identified disgruntled elements within the Nawab’s court. Clive hatched a conspiracy with Mir Jafar, the Nawab’s military commander, promising to install him as the new Nawab in exchange for his betrayal. The battle took place at Palashi (Plassey as the British spelt it), some 150 kilometres north of present-day Kolkata. Some French forces assisted the Nawab, but Mir Jafar’s forces — constituting the majority of the Nawab’s army — stood aside, ensuring a British victory despite their smaller number. Even today, ‘Mir Jafar’ in India remains a synonym for ‘traitor’! By positioning themselves as a kingmaker, the East India Company gradually established control over increasingly large territories. In the 19th century, it went a step further and introduced the infamous Doctrine of Lapse, according to which any princely state would be annexed if its ruler died Fig. 4.7.

This deliberately disregarded the Hindu tradition of adoption, which was a legitimate means of succession in Indian royal houses. DON’T MISS OUT In the Indian context, a princely state was a region that remained under the rule of an Indian prince, maharaja or nawab, but which had accepted British protection and guidance in exchange for maintaining internal autonomy. There were hundreds of them, from large ones (such as Hyderabad, Mysore, Travancore or Jammu & Kashmir) to smaller ones. At the time of India’s Independence, there were over 500 princely states, covering about 40 per cent of the Subcontinent. The Doctrine of Lapse led to the annexation of numerous states, contributing to the expansion of the territorial control of the British. This created much resentment in sections of Indian society and contributed to the 1857 Rebellion (to which we return below). Another stratagem (known as ‘subsidiary alliance’) was to install a British ‘Resident’ in the courts of Indian rulers to protect them against internal or external threats; in exchange, they would have to maintain British troops at their own expense and conduct foreign relations only through the British. While appearing to preserve the sovereignty of princely states, the system effectively transferred real power to the British while burdening Indian rulers with the costs of their own subjugation! The ruler of Hyderabad was among the first to enter such an alliance in 1798; several others soon followed. These so-called alliances allowed the British to control vast territories without the administrative costs of direct rule, creating what was called ‘an empire on the cheap’. Once a state entered the system, exiting it was virtually impossible, as any attempt to break free would face overwhelming British military response."}

Devastating famines A few years after its victory at Plassey, the East India Company secured the right to collect revenue in Bengal, Bihar, and Odisha — some of India’s richest regions. Clive described Bengal in particular as ‘the paradise of the earth’. The Company’s agents extracted maximum revenue while investing minimally in governance or development, with devastating consequences for the population. In 1770–1772, coming on top of two years of crop failure, the harsh revenue collection targets imposed by the East India Company in Bengal — requiring farmers to pay a high rate of cash taxes on the produce of their lands, regardless of harvest conditions — caused a catastrophic famine which killed nearly one-third of its population or an estimated 10 million people. In fact, the Company maintained harsh revenue collection targets, even increasing the land tax during the famine. Such cruelty was denounced later not only by Indian personalities but by some British officials and public intellectuals (such as William Digby whom we quoted at the start of this chapter). For instance, a century later, W.W. Hunter, an official, wrote: “While the country every year became a total waste, the English government constantly demanded an increased land-tax. ... All through the stifling summer of 1770 the people went on dying. The husbandmen [farmers] sold their cattle; they sold their implements of agriculture; they devoured their seed-grain; they sold their sons and daughters, till at length no buyer of children could be found; they ate the leaves of trees and the grass of the field. … Day and night a torrent of famished and disease- stricken wretches poured into the great cities.” Paradise: In a religious context, heaven. Here, an ideal, wealthy or perfectly happy place. Such tragic famines were going to recur throughout the British rule in India. During the Great Famine of 1876–1878, for instance, up to 8 million Indians perished, mostly in the Deccan plateau."}

Apart from the factors mentioned above, the British economic policy of ‘free market’, which left prices of commodities free to fluctuate, contributed to the severity of the famines. Thus Lord Lytton, Viceroy of India during the 1876–1878 famine, issued an order that “there is to be no interference of any kind on the part of the Government with the object of reducing the price of food.” At the same time, in 1876, at Fig. 4.9.

Precise numbers of severe famines during the entire British rule vary from a dozen to over 20. According to several Famine Commissions and other reports, it has been estimated that the total number of human victims (‘human’ since millions of cattle and other animals also died) is anywhere between 50 and 100 million — nearly the number of deaths caused by World War II. The British administration did open famine relief camps in some cities (Fig. 4.9), but far too few and with inadequate supplies. Some officials argued that famine relief should be deliberately kept very low; the Famine Commission of 1878–80, for example, stated: “The doctrine that in time of famine the poor are entitled to demand relief ... would probably lead to the doctrine that they are entitled to such relief at all times.” We should note that famines in India had occurred throughout history, caused by droughts, floods, military campaigns and other factors, but never on such a scale. During the colonial era, India, especially rural India, sank into deep poverty and never recovered. The drain of India’s wealth As we saw earlier, economic exploitation of India formed the foundation of British colonial policy. In 1895, the U.S. historian and political scientist Brooks Adams noted: “Very soon after [the Battle of] Plassey, the Bengal plunder began to arrive in London, and the effect appears to have been instantaneous, for all authorities agree that the ‘industrial revolution’ ... began with the year 1760. ... Possibly since the world began no investment has ever yielded the profit reaped from the Indian plunder.” In other words, according to Adams, the Industrial Revolution in Britain, which required much investment, was made possible at least partly by the ‘stolen wealth from India’ (this phrase is by the U.S. historian Will Durant)."}

Indian cotton textiles, in particular, with rich and intricate designs, bright colours, and textures ranging from ultra-thin muslins to richly embossed fabrics were in high demand in many parts of the world. LET’S EXPLORE Do you understand all the terms used above to list and describe Indian textiles? If not, form groups of four or five and try to find out more, then compare your findings with the help of your teacher. British policy imposed heavy duties on Indian textiles imported into Britain while forcing India to accept British manufactured goods with minimal tariffs. Moreover, Britain now controlled most of the sea trade as well as exchange rates, so Indian traders found it difficult to export as earlier. The result was the ruin of Indian textile industry. In the 19th century, India’s textile exports fell sharply, while Britain’s imports into India grew even more sharply. Communities of skilled artisans who had practised their craft for generations were reduced to poverty and forced to return to subsistence agriculture on increasingly overtaxed land. As William Bentinck, then Governor-General of India, observed in 1834, “The bones of the cotton weavers are bleaching the plains of India.” Similar scenarios unfolded for India’s manufactures of iron, steel, paper and other goods. India’s share of the world GDP kept declining throughout the colonial rule, reaching hardly 5 per cent at the time of Independence. In less than two centuries, one of the richest lands of the world had become one of the poorest.

Charles Metcalfe, an acting Governor-General in the 1830s, described the system and its efficiency in this important statement: “The village communities are little republics, having nearly everything they want within themselves. They seem to last where nothing else lasts. Dynasty after dynasty tumbles down; revolution succeeds to revolution; but the village community remains the same. … This union of the village communities, each one forming a separate little state in itself, has contributed more than any other cause to the preservation of the people of India.” The British systematically dismantled these indigenous governance systems, replacing them with a centralised bureaucracy designed primarily to facilitate tax collection and maintain order, rather than promote public welfare. This transformation destroyed centuries-old mechanisms of community decision-making. The introduction of British codes of law disregarded customary laws and practices that had governed Indian communities for generations. While presented as modernisation, this imposition of a foreign system unsuited to India alienated ordinary Indians from the judicial system, creating courts that were expensive, time-consuming, and conducted in a foreign language. Transforming Indian education: creating ‘brown Englishmen’ Education became a powerful tool for the creation of a class of Indians who would serve British interests.

Macaulay. In it, although he admitted that he had “no knowledge of either Sanskrit or Arabic,” he expressed his conviction that European knowledge was vastly superior to India’s: “I have never found one among them [Orientalists] who could deny that a single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia.” Indians, therefore needed British education, whose objective would be to create a class of Indians who would be “Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals, and in intellect.” Although a few prominent British Orientalists argued that Indian students should be left to study in their own languages, Macaulay’s policy gained the upper hand and India’s traditional schools slowly disappeared, while English became a language of prestige associated with the colonial masters, resulting in lasting divisions in Indian society between English-educated elites and the masses. The new education system served multiple colonial objectives. It created a pool of Indian clerks and minor officials who could staff the lower ranks of the colonial administration at a fraction of the cost of British personnel. It also sidelined traditional sources of knowledge and authority, creating generations of Indians disconnected from their own cultural heritage.

Reshaping economic structures to serve imperial needs The British transformed India’s economy from a self-sufficient agricultural system supplemented by craft and manufacture production into a supplier of raw materials for British industry and a market forced to buy British goods. Without going into the technical details of this economic transformation, let us take the example of the construction of India’s vast railway network, often cited as a colonial blessing. While the railways did bring people closer together and integrated India’s internal market, it was designed primarily to move raw materials from the interior to ports for export and to distribute British manufactured goods throughout India.

Another purpose was to move armies quickly from their cantonments if they had to fight a distant rebellion or war. Besides, the construction of India’s railways was not a gift from the colonial rulers to India. Most of it was paid for by Indian tax revenue, which means that Indian funded infrastructure that primarily served British strategic and commercial interests, instead of being focused on serving the people’s needs. The same can be said of the telegraph network. Even the administrative costs of colonialism were borne by Indian subjects. The colonial administrative apparatus, military installations, and the lavish lifestyles of British officials in India were all financed by Indian taxation. In short, Indians funded their own subjugation. Early Resistance Movements: Challenging Colonial Authority India was such an enormous source of wealth, natural and human resources for the British that they nicknamed her ‘the jewel in the crown of the British Empire’. And they asserted that India would forever remain part of the British Empire, “on which the sun never sets.” THINK ABOUT IT What is meant by “the sun never sets on the British Empire”? Do you think this was a correct statement? However, almost from the beginning of the British conquest of India, resistance movements manifested to try and repel this self-imposed ‘guest’. We will briefly survey a few such movements, but before we do so, let us have a good look at the map of the British Indian Empire (Fig. 4.16).

The British called them ‘bandits’, executed some of them and used their superior forces to eventually defeat them. This rebellion later inspired the Bengali writer Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay’s novel Anandamath (1882); it contained the song ‘Vande Mātaram’, which would inspire Indians during the struggle for freedom in the early 20th century and, after Independence, became India’s national song. Tribal uprisings India’s tribal communities faced unique threats as the British expanded into forests and hills, disrupting their traditional way of life. The British described tribals as ‘primitive’, restricted their access to forests and forest produce, sometimes acquiring tribal land or turning it into private property, imposing cash taxes, catching tribals in debt traps, replacing traditional tribal councils with the British legal system and encouraging missionaries to ‘civilise’ and convert tribals to Christianity. Besides, a colonial law categorised hundreds of tribal communities as ‘criminal tribes’, causing them to be unjustly harassed for decades. Some of the above abuse led some tribes to rise in rebellion against the colonial power. Among the first such events, the Kol Uprising (1831–1832) in Chota Nagpur (in present-day Jharkhand) started when the British introduced land policies that favoured outsiders over the original tribal inhabitants. The Kol tribes (which included the Mundas and Oraons, among others) temporarily established their control over significant territory before being defeated by the British forces. The Santhal Rebellion of 1855 –1856, a widespread uprising of the Santhal people across parts of present-day Jharkhand, Bihar and West Bengal, was led by two brothers, Sidhu and Kanhu Murmu, and rebelled against moneylenders and landlords who were taking away their ancestral lands with British support.

When they refused to grow indigo, they faced imprisonment, torture, and destruction of their property.

The military decisions were, however, taken by the commanders. The revolt quickly spread across northern and central India, with sepoys capturing key cities like Kanpur, Lucknow and Jhansi. At Kanpur, rebel forces under Nana Saheb initially agreed to give safe passage to British civilians, but then massacred over 200 men, women and children for reasons that are still debated. The British response was systematic and extremely brutal, beginning with the recapture of Delhi in September 1857, where the British forces conducted house-to-house massacres. At Kanpur, they conducted mass executions designed to strike terror in the population. In a long punitive campaign they burned villages and destroyed crops, causing countless deaths — vastly more than those inflicted by the rebels. According to some historians, the Great Rebellion failed because the sepoys lacked a unified command and a consistent strategy, despite some heroic leaders. The uprising failed, but it marked a turning point, especially in sowing a seed for the idea that foreign domination was unacceptable. The seed would grow early in the 20th century into a full-fledged struggle for freedom, though with different methods. Meantime, in 1858, the British Crown took direct control of India from the East India Company, initiating the period of the British Raj. British policies shifted from aggressive territorial expansion to consolidation of control. The Indian Army was reorganised so as to prevent unified resistance in the future.

The British (and the French to a much smaller extent) were systematic in documenting every aspect of their conquest, from its geography (they conducted meticulous surveys of the Subcontinent). They created impressive lists of all ethnic groups, although the lists were flawed because of the unscientific but prevalent notions of ‘race’ (as genetics has shown, ‘races’ do not exist). They also documented India’s monuments, studying their art and architecture, restoring some of the ruined ones, and initiating the discipline of archaeology. But in the process, they (and other colonial powers) stole thousands of statues, paintings, jewels, manuscripts and other cultural artefacts from India and sent them to European museums or private collections. While this represented a profound cultural loss and violation of India’s heritage, it also promoted some appreciation of Indian art in the European public.

Election to the Rajya Sabha The candidates elected to the Rajya Sabha are also known as Members of Parliament (MPs), but they are chosen through indirect elections. Let us revisit the example of Suryodaya School. Imagine that the school is setting up a special council at the school level. If the members of this council are elected by the class representatives, it would be an indirect election. Of the 245 members of the Rajya Sabha, 233 are elected by the elected members of the state legislative assemblies (MLAs), while the President of India nominates 12. Each state is allotted a different number of Rajya Sabha seats based on population. For example, more populous states like Uttar Pradesh have more seats than less populous states like Arunachal Pradesh. The Rajya Sabha is also called the Permanent House — it is never dissolved. A member of the Rajya Sabha has a six-year term. One- third of its members retire every two years, and new members are elected. There is a difference, however, in the voting process. It uses what is called a ‘single transferable vote system’. This is a special way of ensuring that smaller states also get fair representation in the Rajya Sabha.

The citizens of a free country could now make decisions about their own governance. The first important step in this new epoch in the life of our nation was the drafting of the Constitution of independent India. This comprehensive document laid foundational principles for the nation, including that of Universal Adult Franchise which guarantees all adult citizens of the country the right to vote irrespective of their social or economic background, gender, race, or religion. The people of India directly elect their representatives who become members of the Lok Sabha. A majority group from among these elected representatives forms the government. The Parliament is the supreme legislative body of the government (it makes laws for the country). It comprises all elected representatives of the people and controls and guides the work of the government. The government can therefore be seen as functioning with the people’s consent. There have been 17 Lok Sabhas since the first one in 1952. The 18th Lok Sabha was constituted in June 2024. Fig. 6.3. The Parliament Building (Sansad Bhavan) in New Delhi was constructed to accommodate the growing needs including capacity, technology, sustainability and safety. Fig. 6.2.

Britain’s system inspired our system of Parliamentary democracy. However, there were also experiences that our freedom fighters and Constitution makers had ― the practical experience gained through participation in British colonial governance structures, even if in a very limited way, that provided familiarity with Parliamentary procedures; the memory of the ancient republics (mahājanapadas); the village panchayats where elders made collective decisions, as we learnt in a previous chapter. Extensive discussions took place during the making of the Constitution regarding whether India should have a bicameral system. It was felt that a single directly elected House would be inadequate to meet the challenges independent India would face. In the spirit of ‘federalism’, it was felt that a Council of States, the Rajya Sabha, was needed. The composition and process of election to the Rajya Sabha were also designed to be different. India practices federalism, which is a form of government where power is distributed between the centre, states, as well as local governments. This system helps to keep the balance between national unity and local interests.

The Constitution has laid out an elaborate and rigorous process for lawmaking. A law is generally brought into force through an instrument called an act. A bill, which is a draft of a proposed law, is introduced in Parliament and goes through a long and effortful journey before it becomes an act. Given below is the journey of how a bill becomes an act, and ultimately a law, in the case of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 (RTE). “Most people call me RTE. I came into existence in August 2009, though the idea began almost a century before. My roots lie in the Directive Principles of State Policy of the Indian Constitution. Though the Constitution makers wanted me implemented within a decade after Independence, this didn’t happen, leaving countless children without access to education. In the early 1990s, someone argued in court that I was inherently part of the Fundamental Rights in the Constitution, namely, the Right to Life — as education is important to lead a meaningful life. Parliamentary action began some years later with the introduction of the 86th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2002, which mandated — as Article 21A of the Constitution — that the state shall provide free and compulsory education to all children between the ages of 6 and 14 years. Six years later, I was tabled as a bill in the Rajya Sabha. A committee studied me thoroughly and suggested modifications. The major debate concerned funding — new schools, infra- structure, and teachers for millions of children would be costly. By 2008, the MPs determined it was time. After the 2009 elections, the new government pursued the matter, and in August 2009, I was passed in the Lok Sabha and received the President’s assent, becoming an Act. Today, I’ve enabled the creation of legal pathways for children to attend school, facilitated new school construction, and ensured free books and uniforms for children.” Bill: A bill is a draft of a proposed law that needs to be approved by the parliament before it can be enacted into law."}

One example is a ‘Money Bill’ that is concerned with financial matters (including taxation, government borrowing, etc.).

They are:  primarily responsible for implementing and enforcing laws and overseeing the effective running of the government;  take decisions regarding the day-to-day functioning of the government based on the principles laid out in the Constitution and its laws;  answerable to the Lok Sabha, through mechanisms like the Question Hour which require ministers to justify their actions and decisions. The Question Hour in the Lok Sabha is a select period (typically the first hour of a Parliamentary session) where MPs can ask the ministers questions about government policies and activities.

The Judiciary functions through a system of courts and plays a pivotal role in maintaining the democratic nature of society and governance. The Judiciary acts as the custodian of the Constitution, ensuring that all branches of the government operate within the principles and parameters enshrined in the Constitution. It keeps a check on the effective functioning of society and institutions of the government by interpreting laws, resolving disputes, and safeguarding fundamental rights. The Constitution not only describes how the Legislature and Executive are given power to govern the country, but it also lists the specific responsibilities of these organs. To ensure that the powers of the Legislature are used properly and responsibilities are followed, the Judiciary is given the unique and critical responsibility of checking that the laws passed by Parliament have not violated the Constitutional framework. Similarly, if a violation of the Constitution occurs when the laws are implemented by the Executive, the Judiciary again has the power to step in. Just as the Parliament functions through its Legislature and the Executive arms, the Judiciary functions through its Courts. In this chapter, we have explored how the organs within the Parliament balance making of the law and executing it, and how the Judiciary checks these actions. These are all examples of the separation of powers and the system of checks and balances among the Legislature, the Executive, and the Judiciary, ensuring that no one organ becomes too powerful.

Legislative and Executive Functions at the State Level As discussed, the Union Government has a Parliament with legislative and executive functions. Similarly, each state has its own legislature and executive, called its ‘State Assembly’. Just as the Parliament has Members of Parliament (MPs) who make laws, there are Members of Legislative Assembly (MLAs) who formulate laws on subjects that are on the ‘State List’ and on the ‘Concurrent List’. Union List, State List, and Concurrent List The Constitution has lists that help to clarify the areas on which the Union and State governments can exclusively legislate, called the Union List and the State List, respectively. There is also a Concurrent List that has subjects on which both the Union and State governments can legislate. However, in the case that the Union government legislates on a subject in the Concurrent List, the state government is bound to follow it.

The states having a bicameral system are Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh, while the remaining states have a unicameral system. LET’S EXPLORE What type of legislature does your state have? Challenges to the Effective Functioning of the Legislatures As discussed, the Indian legislature (including the Parliament at the Centre and the State Assemblies) has the critical and vital role of enacting laws, overseeing administrative processes, and approving the budget. It also provides a platform for discussing national policies, development plans, international relations, and addressing public grievances. However, the legislature also faces several challenges in its effective functioning. Fig. 6.12. Vidhana Soudha houses the legislature in Karnataka.

Venkaiah Naidu given in 2021: “...the productivity of Rajya Sabha during 2004-14 has been about 78% and it declined to about 65% since then. Of the 11 sessions [that he presided over], four of them clocked low productivity of 6.80%, 27.30%, 28.90% and 29.55%; during the year 2018, the Rajya Sabha recorded the lowest ever productivity of 35.75% under the impact of disruptions.” What conclusions can you draw from this statement? What implications does this have for the role that the Rajya Sabha is expected to play? Some of these can include regular absenteeism of members, non- cooperative conduct or communication of members, reduced quality of important debates, and disruptions of the Question Hour. The Parliament typically meets three times a year. These meetings are called ‘sessions’ ― Budget Sessions, Monsoon Sessions and Winter Sessions. Each of these has ‘sittings’, where the Parliament meets to deliberate upon proposed laws, discuss important matters of governance, and seek explanations from the Executive on its decisions and actions. Usually, the Parliament sits for 6 hours a day during sessions. This can be extended on special occasions or when there is a need to complete urgent business. The State Assemblies too, have similar schedules. LET’S EXPLORE Æ Study the data given in the following table. What conclusions can you draw about the functioning of Parliament over time?

Factors of Production Land (natural resources) The word ‘land’ in economics encompasses not only geographical land but also natural resources like soil, forests, water, air, sunlight, minerals, oil, and natural gas. Recollect the chapter on Natural Resources and Their Use, where we discussed different types of resources that nature gifts to us and how we use them.

Write its related information on a piece of paper, such as its name, what it does, and how it works, sketches or drawings of what it would look like, and so on. Discuss with your classmates. How are the Factors Connected? The factors — land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology are combined to produce goods and services, and the proportion of each factor used depends on the product. For example, output from the agriculture, construction, and handicraft sectors relies more on labour and thus is labour- intensive, while semiconductor chips or satellites require more capital, specialised machinery, and are capital-intensive. These factors complement each other and are interconnected; in case of some missing or misused factors, production can become inefficient or can be halted. However, in some cases, new techniques can change the proportion used and output. For instance, increased machine use in agriculture can lower dependence on labour. Similarly, 3-D printing can help revive the dying art forms in textiles by producing handloom products at a large scale to serve the market. The production inputs are available at different geographic locations. Businesses can procure them from these varied locations and combine the inputs to produce goods and services.

Human effort is involved at every stage of production to design, supervise, and improve products and processes. For example, teams of software, electrical, and mechanical engineers, along with project managers, use their expertise to develop a product. The entrepreneur provides guidance on how resources should be used. Then, procuring resources like land, factory space, machinery, and skilled workers requires financial resources. Together, all these inputs are essential, working like puzzle pieces to create the goods and services we rely on!

However, these resources are limited and can be harmed if we are not careful. For example, in Tamil Nadu, many people earn money by working in leather factories. This helps the local economy, but the waste from these factories can pollute rivers and soil. In the same way, when old smartphones are not recycled properly, harmful substances like lead and mercury can leak into the ground and water. This pollution can be dangerous for people, animals, and plants. That is why it is important for producers to use natural resources responsibly — so that we can meet our needs today without making it harder for future generations to meet theirs. They should try to reduce waste, avoid pollution, and protect the environment while making products. THINK ABOUT IT How are local communities and biodiversity affected by such activities? Do you also know some places around you that have seen water and land degradation over time? Discuss in class. So, it is important for producers to adopt sustainable practices to replenish natural resources for future use. Fig. 7.24.
