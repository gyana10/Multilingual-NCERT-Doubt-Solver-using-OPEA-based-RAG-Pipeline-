{"class": "class 8", "subject": "science", "page_no": 3, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 envisages a system of education in the country that is rooted in an Indian ethos and its civilisational accomplishments in all fields of knowledge and human endeavour. At the same time, it aims to prepare students to engage constructively with the opportunities and challenges of the twenty-first century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. By nurturing students’ inherent abilities across all five planes of human existence (pañchakośhas), the Foundational and Preparatory Stages set the Stage for further learning at the Middle Stage. Spanning Grades 6 to 8, the Middle Stage serves as a critical three-year bridge between the Preparatory and Secondary Stages. The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It strives to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages—including at least two languages native to India—to Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas, as these textbooks are intended to play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy—a role that helps strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. The Curiosity, textbook of science for Grade 8 is designed to make learning fun, engaging, and meaningful. Aligned with the NEP 2020 and the NCF-SE 2023, the textbook promotes experiential and inquiry-based learning. It encourages students to ask questions, think critically, Foreword"}

Integrating physics, chemistry, biology, and earth science, the textbook also highlights environmental awareness, ethical values, and insights from India’s rich tradition of knowledge. Featuring numerous hands-on activities and relatable examples, the book aims to simplify complex topics and foster deeper understanding. Collaborative learning is encouraged through group work and peer discussions, helping learners develop creativity, logical thinking, and decision-making skills. Rather than simply reading about science, students are guided to explore, question, and experience it actively—making the learning process both enjoyable and impactful. However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook, and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years. \b Dinesh Prasad Saklani Director New Delhi\b National Council of Educational June 2025\b Research and Training"}

Our journey of exploration continues in Curiosity for Grade 8, where you will learn to ask deeper questions, design investigations, and think like real scientists. The Grade 8 textbook of science has been developed in alignment with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023. It is expected that all competencies outlined for the final year of Middle Stage (Grade 8) are achieved. This textbook is designed to help you learn about important topics, such as matter, the physical and living world, health, hygiene, and the connection between science, technology, and society. It also helps you understand how science works and how scientists think and explore. The main aim of Curiosity is to help you become a responsible and thoughtful member of society. The textbook integrates topics from biology, chemistry, physics, and earth science. It also incorporates essential themes, such as environmental care, value education, inclusivity, health, hygiene, and India’s traditional knowledge systems. The goal is to help you learn through real experiences rather than by simply memorising facts. Curiosity, the textbook of science for Grade 8, contains 13 chapters. Each chapter includes engaging activities, thought-provoking questions, and clear illustrations to support your learning. The first chapter is titled Exploring the Investigative World of Science. It gives you a quick look at the various topics you will come across in this book and is designed to get you more excited about science! This chapter takes you to the next step — entering the investigative world of science, where curiosity, wonder, and discovery come together. You will learn to ask focused questions, design and try out simple experiments to help answer them, and use your observation, exploration, and investigation skills to understand how things work. This chapter is meant to be a fun and friendly introduction to your science journey. Each chapter begins with a picture linked to the chapter that is designed to spark curiosity, capture your attention, and connect prior knowledge to new concepts. There are a few Probe and ponder questions. These are critical thinking questions that are not for evaluation and do not always have simple answers. Instead, they make you think more deeply and explore new ideas. Some of these About this Book Probe and ponder Dear Young Scientists,"}

We hope you bring along the spirit of adventure and exploration that has guided us so far. In Grade 6, we discovered how science begins with wonder, with simple “Why?” and “How?” questions about the world around us. In Grade 7, we learnt that science is always evolving — that each answer opens new questions, and how our ideas can slowly change as we explore deeper. Now, in Grade 8, we take the next step: entering the Investigative World of Science, where wonder and evolution come together to form the heart of how science works. We don’t want you to just learn new facts, we want you to learn how to find new facts. Investigation in science means more than just looking at something and asking only simple questions. Now you can ask more focused questions, and design ways to perhaps do simple experiments to answer those questions, and then use your observations to improve your understanding. Step by step, we will learn how to use questions as starting points to try to observe carefully, experiment thoughtfully, and explain clearly what we see. In doing so, each of you won’t just be learners but also investigators, young scientists, exploring real-world puzzles. These may range from everyday life — like why does dough rise? — to the bigger mysteries of Earth and beyond like is the world getting warmer? As you turn each page of this book, we hope you notice the interesting design of our page numbers once again. On the left-hand pages, at the bottom, you’ll find the image of a root, symbolising the deep, solid foundation of knowledge that keeps us connected to our environment, traditions, and our cultural and natural heritage. On the right-hand pages, in the top corner, you’ll find a kite soaring in the sky, reminding us that curiosity must take flight if we are to explore the unknown. Together, these two symbols — the root and the kite — invite you to stay grounded in real observations, while allowing your ideas to soar towards new horizons. Remember, investigation in science works best only when we balance the solid ground of careful observation with the freedom of creative thinking. You will also notice some patterns in the lines at the bottom of the page. There are some hidden scientific thoughts in these as well. But don’t worry, they are mainly to make the page a little less boring. Let us now take a brief look at the various stops on our journey this year, and see where our curiosity, supported by strong roots and lifted by soaring ideas, might take us!"}

We will start by examining something as small as a single drop of water, and uncover a hidden world of tiny organisms, unseen but deeply linked to us. Some of these are invisible helpers, that help us digest our food or produce medicines, while others can be harmful, causing infections. But what does our body need to stay healthy? How do we fight these infections? We’ll find out how nutritious food, exercise, medicines, and vaccines help us stay healthy and fight infections. But that’s just the beginning. In today’s world, science does play a major role in improving our lives. For example, we use electric current in many ways to help make our lives easier. We depend on the heating effect of electric current to keep us warm, while the magnetic effect helps motors run and machines function. These phenomena depend on fundamental forces. So after watching electricity do work, we move on to study these forces themselves, starting with those that make objects speed up, slow down, or change direction. Understanding forces helps explain why a ball thrown up in the air falls back to the ground, or why a car stops when the brakes are applied. This also leads us to the idea of pressure — how the force is distributed over an object. The same concepts of force and pressure also decide how air moves. A small difference in pressure can result in a gentle breeze while a stronger pressure difference can lead to strong winds, and sometimes even cyclones."}

To truly understand how air can exert pressure or why water boils at a certain temperature we need to zoom into these materials and see what kind of particles they are made up of, and how they move around. Everything around us is made of tiny particles. In materials that are solid these particles cannot move much, while in gases they can move around freely. Classifying things around us is an important feature of science. We can also classify materials around us into elements (pure substances), compounds (two or more elements bonded together), and mixtures (combinations that can be separated physically). Once we know how particles combine or mix, we can then understand solutions — for example, how sugar dissolves in tea to make it sweet. From the world of particles and mixtures, we then move into the world of light. We’ll study how light rays reflect off flat and curved mirrors, and bends when passing through lenses and helps us understand the working of many objects around us. The bending of light explains what happens when we see an image in a shiny metal spoon or how corrective glasses help many of us see clearly. It’s not just a polished mirror that reflects light, rough surfaces reflect light as well, and so does the Moon. Depending on the relative positions of the Earth, Moon and Sun, a slightly different part of the Moon is illuminated each night, giving rise to the beautiful phases of the Moon that we see in the sky. Watching the periodic cycles of the Moon’s phases allowed humans to come up with the first calendars. By combining careful observations of sunrises, sunsets, and lunar cycles, various calendars came into being. Isn’t it fascinating that the calendars which determine our routines on Earth are linked to the motions of objects far beyond our planet?"}

Right here on Earth, there are marvellous and complex patterns of relationships between living organisms and their environments. Every living being — from tiniest insect to the largest whale, from blades of grasses to tall trees — depends on and responds to the air, water, sunlight, and other organisms around them forming the ecosystems that support life on our planet. In the final chapter of this book, we can put it all together and try to understand what makes Earth ‘just right’ for life and to recognise the urgent challenges that our planet now faces. Most importantly, the Earth lies at the perfect distance from the Sun, where water remains liquid, and it has an atmosphere that provides the oxygen we breathe while shielding us from harmful ultraviolet rays. But human activities on the planet can cause small changes in the temperature of the Earth, disrupting climate patterns, with dangerous consequences.

Firstly, remember that science is everywhere! You don’t need a fancy laboratory to do simple experiments. Even your kitchen at home is a wonderful place to observe and ask questions. All you need is to start with curiosity, careful observation, and asking what happens if…? Have you noticed how a puri or a batura puffs up when placed in hot oil? Or how a phulka swells when put directly on the flame. Why does it puff up like a balloon? And why is one side thinner than the other? These are questions a scientist might ask — and you can too! Let’s see how we can investigate this simple everyday phenomenon like a scientist would. First, we will try to ask a scientific question. What are the different things that may change the way a puri puffs up when fried? To answer this, we may want to do some simple experiments. For that, we try and find out two main things — what all can we change or control when we do the experiment, and what all can we observe to see if these changes made any difference. In this case, we can perhaps think of the changing the thickness and the size of the rolled dough. We could also try to use different types of flour (atta, maida, etc.). While frying the puri, we can also change the temperature of the hot oil, or try and drop the rolled dough into the oil in different ways (drop it vertically? slide it at an angle? slide it slowly?) Notice that these are things that we can control. However, to make sense of the changes, we also need to think of what we can observe or measure. Some of these may have just yes/no answers, in some cases there might be a number we can measure. Maybe we can start by checking whether the puri puffs up (yes/no), or we can measure the time it takes to puff up (seconds). We can check whether a very thick layer of dough still gives a thin side to the puri. Further, while doing such experiments, it is better to change only one thing at a time while keeping the other conditions same. For example, if we wanted to see the effect of boiling hot, hot, and not very hot oil, we would"}

It is also a good idea to keep notes of everything that you see and sense when doing an experiment. Did the oil splatter, smell, or smoke? And after doing one round of experiments, you may think of more questions. Do puris puff better when made fresh or from stored dough? What happens if I prick a hole in the puri before frying? This is exactly how all scientific experiments, from simple to the most complicated are done. This is the idea of systematic investigation. And just so you know, even this simple everyday observation — of a puri swelling — is not really completely understood by scientists today! So, whether it is the swelling of a puri or the shrinking bright part of the Moon after purnima, let your careful observations guide you along your explorations into the investigate world of science.

For a long time, many tiny things around us remained unknown. Long ago, people discovered that a curved piece of glass could make small things look bigger. The piece of glass was shaped like a lentil seed — thick in the middle and thin at the edge — hence they called it a lens. Over time, lenses were improved to become more powerful. Each new tool, from simple magnifying glasses to microscopes, helped humans see what their eyes could not. The invention of the microscope opened a fascinating hidden world filled with tiny living creatures. We will explore some of these life forms in this chapter. You have already learnt about the amazing variety of living beings. Just look around — there are so many beautiful plants and animals! They are of all shapes, sizes, and colours. Some living beings are tiny, while others are really big. They differ not only in their structure but also in many other features. All these living beings, whether plants or animals, are called organisms. Have you ever noticed the smallest organism around you that is visible to the naked eye? Think about it — how small a thing can your eyes actually see? You might have seen some people using reading glasses. How does it help them see better?

In 1665, a scientist named Robert Hooke published a book called Micrographia. He was a careful observer, and a skilled artist. In this book, he showed detailed drawings of tiny things that people had never seen before — things he saw using a tool we now call a microscope. His microscope made things look 200 to 300 times bigger, than what one could see with the unaided eye. One day, he looked at a thin slice of cork and saw it was made of many small, empty spaces. These compartments reminded him of a honeycomb. He drew what he saw and called each small space a cell. This was the first time the word cell was used in science to describe the basic unit of life. Around the same time in 1660s, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch scientist, made better lenses that allowed him to build more useful microscopes. He was the first person to clearly see and describe tiny living things like bacteria and blood cells. Because of this, he is known as the Father of Microbiology.

What similarities and differences did you observe between the cells of onion peel in Activity 2.2 and human cheek cells in Activity 2.3? You have observed that cells have three main parts — a thin outer lining, a central region, and a small round structure inside it. The outer layer is called the cell membrane. The round structure in the middle is the nucleus, which is also covered by a thin membrane. The space between the cell membrane and nucleus is filled with cytoplasm. These three — cell membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus — are the basic parts of a cell. Some cells, like onion peel cells, have an extra outer layer called the cell wall. What is the importance of these structures in a cell? What functions do they perform? Are these functions important for the maintenance of life? The cell membrane encloses the cytoplasm and nucleus. The cell membrane separates one cell from another. It is porous and allows the entry of materials essential for life processes and the exit of waste material. Cytoplasm contains other components of the cell and compounds, such as carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and mineral salts. Most of the life processes take place within the cytoplasm.

It also regulates growth. The cell wall in the plant cell provides rigidity and strength to plants. This is why all cells are arranged compactly with each other and look firm in structure. A step further Cells in all parts of a plant have tiny rod-shaped structures called plastids. Some plastids, like chloroplasts, contain chlorophyll, which makes them green and helps in photosynthesis. In non-green parts, they help in the storage of substances. Plant cells also have a large, empty-looking space called a vacuole. This helps the plant cell store important substances, get rid of waste, and maintain the shape of the cell. This gives strength and support to the plant. In animal cells, vacuoles are usually not present, if present, they are usually small. These small vacuoles store certain substances dissolved in water (Fig. 2.5). So, a cell is not just a simple bag of liquid — it is a complex structure made up of many different parts, each with its own special function to allow the cell, and in turn the entire organism to work.

What are the similarities and differences you see in them? A muscle cell (Fig. 2.6a) is shaped like a spindle, while a nerve cell (Fig. 2.6b) is very long and has branches.

But how do these cells help in performing various functions in the body? Let us find out. You observed in Activity 2.3 that inner cheek cells are thin and flat. They form a protective lining on the inner surface of the cheek. Nerve cells also known as neurons carry messages in our body. The elongated shape and branched structure help them reach different parts of the body and pass on messages quickly. Similarly, plant cells also show variation. In plants, too, cells may be rectangular, elongated, oval, or even tube-like. Some plant cells form long tubes that help carry water throughout the plant. You have already studied the digestive system in Grade 7. Different parts of the digestive system are made up of different types of cells. A group of muscle cells are present in the food pipe. These cells contract and relax in a wave-like manner, pushing the food down to the stomach. This movement is possible because muscle cells are thin, flexible, and spindle-shaped. The stomach also has different types of cells for performing different functions. Muscle cells in the stomach wall help churn the food. Other cells in the inner lining of the stomach produce digestive juices and acid that help break down the food. All these cells work together to make digestion possible. 2.2 What Are the Levels of Organisation in the Body of a Living Organism? The body of a living organism is organised in a complex way. Cell (Fig. 2.7a), is the basic unit of life, just like a brick is the basic unit of wall (Fig. 2.3d). A group of similar cells forms a type of tissue (Fig. 2.7b). Different tissues are organised to form an organ (Fig. 2.7c). Several organs work together to form an organ system that performs a major function of the body (Fig. 2.7d). All the organ systems together make up a complete organism (Fig. 2.7e) — like a plant or an animal. So, the levels of organisations are: Cell Tissue Organ Organ system Organism These levels of organisation help us understand how simple building blocks like cells come together to form a complex living being. The life of complex living organisms begins with a single cell— ‘egg’. The egg of any organism has an amazing ability to divide repeatedly to form a complete living being made up of many cells. Such living beings are called multicellular organisms. Animals, including humans, and plants are all examples of multicellular organisms.

The yolk (the yellow part of an egg) of an ostrich egg is a single cell — the largest known cell in the living world — measuring about 130 mm to 170 mm in diameter. The egg contains extra non-cellular material: a shell for protection and a white liquid that nourishes the cell during its continued development. 2.3 What Are Microorganisms? Some living organisms are made up of just one or very few cells. They are so small that they can not be seen with the naked eye. These are called microorganisms. Some microorganisms, like bacteria and Amoeba, are made of just one cell (unicellular). Others, like some fungi and algae, have many cells (multicellular). They are found all around us — in water, soil, air, and even inside our body! But what do their cells look like? Are they like the plant and animal cells we just learnt about, or are they different? To observe the cells of a microorganism, again, we need to use a microscope which magnifies their size and makes them visible to us. Scientists have also created a low-cost and foldable paper microscope or foldscope. Foldscopes may not provide the same level of details like high-powered laboratory microscopes. However, these make microscopic world accessible to many people. Let us now take a closer look at the fascinating world of microbes.

If yes, you may have noticed a powdery or cotton-like growth on them (Fig. 2.9). This happens because they have been infected by microbes. But where did these microbes come from? How did they come in contact with the food? This happens because microorganisms can be found everywhere, be it in water, soil, air, or even in some food items. You can use a foldscope or a microscope to explore surfaces of leaves, stems, roots, or any other part to see them. Like plants and animals, microorganisms also show great diversity. Some of them can even be found in extreme climatic conditions, such as hot water springs and snow cold zones as well as at moderate temperatures. You already know some of these organisms live inside our bodies, especially in our gut! You have studied in the chapter ‘Life Processes in Animals’ in Curiosity, Grade 7 that our intestine has many bacteria that help in digestion. Like plants and animals, microorganisms vary in shape, size, and structure. In Tables 2.1 and 2.2, you would have observed microorganisms of different shapes — spherical, rod-shape, or irregular. How does the diversity of microorganisms play a role in our daily life? How do they help clean the environment? 2.4.1 Key players in cleaning the environment Let us attempt to understand this by doing an activity. Activity 2.7: Let us do z Take an empty container and fill it halfway with garden soil. z Add some fruit and vegetable peels to the container. Thereafter, put a layer of soil on it and leave it aside. This is because you add many spices with salt or sugar to it which act as preservatives. High concentration of salt or sugar do not allow these organisms to grow on them. But why do microorganisms not infect the pickles and murabbas? Fig. 2.9: Fruit with microorganism growing on it"}

You may find that peels of fruits and vegetables have turned into a dark-coloured material. This is manure, which is rich in nutrients and helps increase the fertility of the soil. But how did the peels of fruits and vegetables turn into manure? In Activity 2.6, you saw that soil contains various kinds of microorganisms. Some of these microorganisms, like fungi and bacteria, act on the plant waste and slowly break it down into simpler, nutrient-rich manure. You may have seen gardeners in your school or in a field near your house collecting dry leaves and plant waste and putting them into pits. Do you now understand why they do this? It is to make natural manure. Ancient Indian texts, particularly the Vedas, have references of the word ‘Krimi’ which means different tiny entities including ‘Drishya’ (visible) and ‘Adrishya’ (invisible). Various Vedic texts mention their beneficial and harmful effects. Atharvaveda also refers to ‘Krimi’. Our scientific heritage If you look around carefully, you might see decaying plants and fallen leaves stored in a container or lying in the garden, disappear after some time from the surroundings. This is because microorganisms breakdown and turn them into simpler substances rich in nutrients. These nutrients go back to the soil and help plants grow better. Microorganisms also decompose bodies of dead animals. So, microbes help recycle the waste and return important nutrients to nature. Manure formation occurs at optimal temperature and appropriate moisture level. Isn’t it interesting? By now, you must have understood that bacteria and some fungi are types of microorganisms that play an important role in our lives. And guess what, these helpful bacteria can also decompose animal wastes like dung! From Activity 2.7, we can also infer that microorganisms not only help in plant growth, but also clean our environment by breaking down waste. Fig. 2.10: Recycling of nutrients by making manure"}

A step further Microbes as a source of biogas Many microorganisms, like bacteria and fungi, live in an oxygen- free environment. Some of these bacteria have the ability to decompose plant and animal waste present in the environment or household wastewater. During the process, they release a mixture of gases containing carbon dioxide, and a high proportion of another gas, methane. This gas has been used as a fuel source for cooking, heating, generating electricity, and to even run vehicles. Be a scientist Dr. Ananda Mohan Chakrabarty (1938–2020) was a scientist who studied bacteria. In 1971, he developed a special bacterium that could break down oil spills, helping to clean the environment. His discovery received a patent in 1980. Patent is a copyright given to a person so that no one else can copy, use or sell his/her invention without permission. His work showed how microorganisms could be used to solve environmental problems like pollution. He is remembered for his contributions to science and for protecting the environment using microbes. What are the other problems which you think can be solved with the help of microorganisms? How does the diversity of microorganisms help in our kitchen? 2.4.2 Microorganisms and food Let us try to understand by performing activities in the kitchen. Activity 2.8: Let us perform z Take two bowls A and B. z In each, take 200 g of flour (atta or maida) and add a pinch of sugar. z Now, in bowl A, add a small amount of yeast powder and mix it well with the flour. z In bowl B, do not add any yeast, so that we can compare the results of the two bowls. z Knead the flour of the two bowls with warm water to make soft dough (Fig. 2.11). (a) Dough in bowl A (b) Dough in bowl B Fig. 2.11: Change in the volume of flour after addition of yeast, sugar, and warm water"}

Did you find any change in the volume, smell, or texture of the dough? If not, leave the dough for some more time. After some time, you may notice that the dough in bowl A, where yeast was added, has risen slightly, become fluffy, and has a different smell compared to the dough kneaded without yeast. Why does this happen? What is the role of yeast? Why did we add sugar and warm water to the flour? Yeast is a type of microorganism. It belongs to a group of microorganisms, called fungi. Yeast grows well in warm conditions. You may recall from chapter ‘Life Process in Animals’ in Grade 7 that, like other organisms, yeast also respires and breaks down food to release energy for their growth and carry out life processes. During this process, carbon dioxide is released, which forms bubbles that makes the dough soft and fluffy. Yeast also produces a small amount of alcohol during this process, which gives the dough a slightly different smell. This special property of yeast is used in the process of making breads, cakes, and more! In addition to yeast, some bacteria, such as Lactobacillus, help in fermentation of batter for making idli and dosa, and dough for making bhatura. Activity 2.9: Let us prepare z Take two small glass bowls — label them ‘A’ and ‘B’. z Pour lukewarm milk in bowl A, and cold milk in bowl B. z Now, add a small spoonful of curd to each bowl and mix well using a spoon. z Cover both bowls.

{"class": "class 8", "subject": "science", "page_no": 42, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "22 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 You will observe that in bowl A, the milk has turned into curd after a few hours and has become little sour. Whereas in bowl B, the milk has not curdled, but it might be a little sour. Do you know why this happens? The curd contains several types of bacteria. One of them is Lactobacillus. This bacterium feeds on the sugar in the milk (lactose), multiplies, and ferments the milk to form curd. Instead of producing alcohol (like yeast), these bacteria produce lactic acid, which makes curd sour. These bacteria grow well in warm conditions. That is why curd is formed in bowl A but not in bowl B. We can categorise the microorganisms into different categories, such as protozoa, fungi, bacteria, some algae, and more. Some bacteria, such as Rhizobium, form the swollen regions called nodules and live in them as shown in Fig. 2.12. Roots of certain legumes, such as beans, peas, and lentils have root nodules that contain Rhizobium bacteria. These bacteria trap nitrogen from the air and make it useful for the plants. This helps plants grow better without chemical fertilisers. That is why farmers grow legumes in rotation with other crops. This naturally increases the nitrogen in the soil and keeps it healthy for the next crop. 2.4.3 Amazing microalgae: tiny helpers in water Microalgae are microscopic plant-like organisms that live in water, soil, air, and even on trees. They make their own food using sunlight. While doing this, they also release oxygen and produce more than half of the Earth’s oxygen supply. They are rich in nutrients and serve as a food source for many aquatic animals. Some, like Spirulina, Chlorella, and Diatoms, are also used by humans as health supplements and medicines. Microalgae also help in cleaning water and are used to make biofuel. However, pollution, climate change, and habitat destruction are threatening microalgal diversity and abundance. It is important to conserve these tiny organisms to protect the environment and maintain oxygen balance on Earth. Fig. 2.12: Root nodules of Cowpea plant which contain Rhizobium"}

Spirulina, a microalga, is called a superfood because of its health benefits. Spirulina is also a good source of vitamin B12, which is essential for our body. It has a lot of protein— more than 60 per cent of its body weight—and only a small amount of fat and sugar. Nowadays, farming of Spirulina is becoming a feasible livelihood opportunity. You can grow Spirulina easily by following these steps: 1. \u0007Set a clear glass tank in a bright place away from direct sunlight. 2. \u0007Cover the tank with a shade net, or keep the tank at a place with moderate temperature conditions. 3. \u0007Fill the tank with pond water. 4. \u0007Add living Spirulina collected from a pond. 5. \u0007Stir the growing Spirulina twice a week. 6. \u0007After 3–6 weeks, Spirulina may be harvested from the tank by filtering it through a fine cloth. Conservation of microalgae is a good practice for ensuring food security and livelihood development. 2.5 \u0007Why Is Cell Considered to Be a Basic Unit of Life? The body of all living organisms are made up of tiny building blocks called cells. A single cell contains various components that help organisms perform various functions. The bodies of all plants and animals are made up of many cells. Therefore, they are called multicellular (many-celled) organisms. In multicellular organisms, cells carry out specialised functions individually but also cooperate with each other to increase the chance of survival. Some microorganisms, such as bacteria and protozoa, are made up of just one cell. These are called unicellular (single-celled) organisms. They carry out all the functions necessary for their survival in a single cell. Other microbes, like algae and fungi, are made up of one or more cells. For example, yeast is a unicellular fungus while mould is a multicellular fungus. Nucleoid Fig. 2.13: A bacterial cell showing the nucleoid region"}

Cells of fungi additionally have a cell wall, but they do not have chloroplasts, so they cannot make their own food through photosynthesis. Bacteria do not have a well-defined nucleus and a nuclear membrane. Instead they have a nucleoid. This feature distinguishes them from cells of yeast, protozoa, algae, fungi, plants, and animals. We have only looked at a few basic cell structures here. The cell has other components about which you will learn in higher classes. For observing subcellular components, we need microscopes with high magnification. An electron microscope magnifies the cell about 10,00,000 times, where we can see more structures present in a cell. By now, you must have understood that all living beings, including microorganisms, are made up of one or more cells. Their cells differ in size, shape, and structure. Plant and animal cells also have some differences. Understanding these differences helps us learn how these organisms function differently. In this chapter, we have learnt about the beneficial microorganisms. However, there are some microbes that cause diseases in plants and animals including humans. We will learn about some of the diseases caused by microbes in the next chapter.

What do the news clippings on the notice board tell you about people’s health in our country? Is being healthy just about not having diseases? Health also includes feeling good physically, staying positive, and having strong relationships. A healthy person takes care of their body, maintains a positive mindset, and enjoys social life. Let us now explore what it truly means to be healthy. Activity 3.1: Let us read A Grade 8 student moved to a new school in another city. With no friends in his new environment and busy parents, he felt lonely. To cope, he spent more time on his phone and social media, but this made him feel worse. He stopped trying to make friends, had headaches, lost weight, and could not sleep well. A doctor advised less screen time and meeting a counsellor. The school counsellor arranged help to support him in making friends and improving his health. Think and Reflect: What was the cause of the boy’s health problems? How did his habits and surroundings affect his well-being? As per the World Health Organization (WHO), health is defined as a ‘state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease’ (Fig. 3.1). A healthy person can perform various tasks more efficiently and cope well in different and difficult situations. A healthy person can adjust well with peer groups and other members of society. Let us understand more about health. Ayurveda teaches us that true health is a balance of body, mind, and surroundings. Following dinacharya (daily routine) and ritucharya (seasonal routine) helps maintain this balance. Eating fresh, wholesome food suited to one’s prakriti (body constitution) is essential. Regular exercise, cleanliness, restful sleep, and a calm mind support overall well-being. This can also be achieved through practices like yoga, meditation, and mindfulness.

A disease is a condition that affects the normal working of the body or mind. It can happen when one or more organs or organ systems stop functioning properly. Some diseases are caused by germs like bacteria, viruses, fungi, worms, or even by protozoa (single-celled organisms). These disease-causing organisms are called pathogens. Other diseases may result from poor nutrition or an unhealthy lifestyle. Some diseases last for a short time, while others can continue for a long time and need regular treatment or care. Diseases can be grouped into two major types based on their causes and how they spread: z Non-communicable diseases— Some diseases, like cancer, diabetes, or asthma, are not caused by pathogens and do not spread from one person to another. They are usually linked to lifestyle, diet, and/or environment. z Communicable diseases— Diseases caused by pathogens are called communicable diseases. They can spread from one person to another. Some examples of communicable diseases are typhoid, dengue, flu, chickenpox, and COVID-19. In recent years, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like diabetes, heart disease, and cancer have become more common in India. This is happening because of changes in how people live — such as eating more processed food, getting less exercise, and living longer lives. Today, most deaths in India are caused by NCDs. Understanding the difference between these two types helps us know how diseases spread and how to prevent them. 3.4.1 How are communicable diseases caused and spread? All communicable diseases are caused by pathogens. These pathogens can enter our body through the air we breathe or by consuming contaminated food or water and more. But how do these pathogens spread from one person to another?

Ability of the body to fight diseases You would have noticed that some people get sick more frequently than others, although living in a similar environment. Do you know why? The natural ability of our body to fight diseases is known as immunity. Our body has a special system called the immune system that helps fight against diseases. You might have taken some drops or injections in your childhood to protect yourself from certain diseases, such as polio, measles, tetanus, and hepatitis. These are vaccines that help prevent serious infections caused by viruses and bacteria. A vaccine helps our body fight certain diseases by training the immune system to recognise and attack harmful germs. providing what is known as acquired immunity — protection developed after exposure to a pathogen or a vaccine. Vaccines can be made in different ways — from weakened or dead pathogens (like viruses or bacteria), or from inactive or harmless parts of the pathogen.

Edward Jenner and the smallpox vaccine Smallpox was a deadly disease that caused blisters and killed millions. A milder disease called cowpox, seen in cows, could also infect humans. In the late 1700s, English doctor Edward Jenner discovered that people who had cowpox did not get smallpox. This led to the invention of the first vaccine and helped protect people from smallpox. Our scientific heritage Long before modern vaccines, India had a traditional method called variolation to protect against smallpox. It involved using material from a smallpox sore to scratch the skin and create a mild infection and build immunity. People who performed this practice were known as teekedaars.

It was a working model of a lifting electromagnet which was displayed by their senior, Sumana. In it, instead of a hook like a typical crane, there was an iron nail wrapped with a wire, which was connected to a battery. When Sumana closed the circuit, the nail picked up iron paper clips like a magnet. When she opened the circuit, the clips fell off. Mohini and Aakarsh, were surprised. They remembered learning earlier (in the chapter ‘Exploring Magnets’, Curiosity, Grade 6) that magnetic materials were attracted by magnet and that iron was a magnetic material. But in Sumana’s model, there was no magnet, only an electric circuit. They were so excited that they wanted to try it out themselves. 4.1 \u0007Does an Electric Current Have a Magnetic Effect?

What do you observe? z Now again while watching the compass needle, move the switch to ‘OFF’ position. What do you observe this time? z Move the switch between ‘ON’ and ‘OFF’ positions a few more times. Carefully observe how the compass needle behaves the each time. You may have noticed that when the current flows, the compass needle gets deflected from its original direction. When the current stops, the needle returns to its original direction. As we have learnt earlier (in the chapter ‘Exploring Magnets’ in Curiosity, Grade 6), the compass needle is a tiny magnet which deflects when a magnet is brought near it and this magnetic effect can act through any non-magnetic materials kept in between. But why does the compass needle deflect when the current flows through the wire? The deflection indicates that the current carrying wire has a magnetic effect on the compass needle. When the current stops, this magnetic effect disappears and the compass needle returns to its original direction. The region around a magnet or a current carrying wire where its magnetic effect can be felt, such as by the deflection of a compass needle, is said to have a magnetic field. When electric current flows through a conductor (like a wire), it produces a magnetic field around it. This phenomenon is known as the magnetic effect of electric current. The magnetic field disappears when the current stops flowing. Be a scientist You have just now made the same discovery which was made by the scientist Hans Christian Oersted (1777–1851) in 1820, that is, the discovery that electricity and magnetism are linked. He was a professor at a university in Denmark. It is said that once while giving a demonstration, he noticed that whenever an electrical circuit was closed or opened, the needle of a magnetic compass, lying nearby, deflected. He investigated this and when he was certain that an electric current indeed produced a magnetic field, he published his findings. This led to other scientists repeating his experiment to check if they got the same results, and further investigating the connection between electricity and magnetism. We have learnt about magnets and electric current in earlier grades. I used to think that there was no link between the two. But now we found that electricity and magnetic effect are linked!"}

It is observed that when current is passed through the cylindrical coil, it behaves like a magnet and deflects the needle of a magnetic compass.

So, if north pole of the magnetic compass is attracted towards end A of the electromagnet, then end A is south pole. z Repeat this procedure to find the polarity of end B as well (Fig. 4.4b). Did you find that the polarity of end B is opposite to the polarity of end A? We learnt in grade 6 that a magnet has two poles. Just like a magnet, an electromagnet also has two poles — North and South. Think like a scientist Repeat Activity 4.3 with — (i) 2 and 4 cells with the same coil, (ii) 2 cells but different number of turns of the coil. What do you observe? A single cell provides only a small amount of current, so the magnetic field is weak. As a result, the deflection of compass needle is less and the coil can only attract a few clips. A battery with more cells gives a larger current as compared to that with a single cell. This creates a stronger magnetic field, so the deflection of the compass needle is more and the coil can attract more clips. The increase in number of turns of the coil also makes the coil a stronger magnet! Also, repeat Activity 4.4 by changing the direction of the current. So, the strength of an electromagnet can be changed by changing the amount of electric current flowing through the coil or the number of turns of the coil, or both. Also, its poles can be reversed by changing the direction of the current. Do you remember learning earlier (in the chapter ‘Exploring Magnets’ in Curiosity, Grade 6) that a freely suspended magnet rests along the north–south direction because our Earth itself behaves like a giant magnet? But why does Earth behave like a magnet? Deep inside the Earth, the movement of liquid iron in the core creates electric currents, which generate a magnetic field. Many migratory birds, fish, and animals use this field to navigate across continents and oceans. The Earth’s magnetic field also acts as a shield, blocking harmful particles from space, and helps protect life on Earth.

Lifting electromagnets are widely used in factories and scrap yards, to move, lift, and sort heavy metal items efficiently. A step further We have learnt that when electric current flows through a conductor (like a wire), it produces a magnetic field around it. In the higher grades, you will learn even more about this wonderful link between electricity and magnetism, including the exciting idea that just as electricity can produce magnetism, a moving magnet can also lead to an electric current. This deep connection between electricity and magnetism is vital to our daily lives, as it forms the basis of many devices, from electric motors to power generators. 4.2 Does a Current Carrying Wire Get Hot? Activity 4.5: Let us observe In this activity, we will use a special kind of wire, called a nichrome wire. z Take a cardboard piece of about 10 cm length and 10 cm width, two nails, a nichrome wire of thickness about 0.3 mm (26–28 gauge) and length of 10 cm, an electric cell, a cell holder, a switch, and connecting wires. z Mount the nails on the cardboard about 5 cm apart. z Tie the nichrome wire between these nails and make the connections as shown in Fig. 4.5 with the switch in OFF position. z Touch the nichrome wire.

What difference do you feel? z Repeat the last two steps to confirm the observation. You may have observed that nichrome wire feels warm when current is passed through it. This happens because, when electric current flows through any conductor, it faces some opposition or resistance to its flow. Different conductors offer different levels of resistance to the flow of current. A nichrome wire, for example, offers higher resistance compared to a copper wire of the same size and length. This resistance causes some of the electrical energy to be converted into heat energy. When an electric current passes through a conductor, it gets heated. This warming is known as the heating effect of electric current. Think like a scientist This activity should be carried out strictly under the supervision of a teacher. Repeat Activity 4.5 with a battery of 2 cells. What do you notice? For the same duration, does the wire heat up more with one cell or two cells? The amount of heat generated is more in the experiment with 2 cells. This is due to the fact that the heat generated depends on the magnitude of the electric current. The heat generated in a wire depends on the material, thickness, and length of the wire, and the duration for which the current flows. In Grade 7, we have learnt that an incandescent lamp glows because its filament is heated by an electric current. Many household appliances, such as electric room heaters, stoves, irons, immersion rods, water heaters, kettles, and hair dryers (Fig. 4.6) work on the same principle of the heating effect of electric current. All these devices contain a rod or a coil of wire, called a heating element. In some appliances where this element is visible, it can be seen glowing red hot.

Beyond household use, heating effect of electric current has several industrial applications.

The portable sources of electricity, such as cells and batteries, are so fascinating. Using these, we could light up a small lamp, make a magnet, and heat up a wire. 4.3 How Does a Battery Generate Electricity? Let us start with one of the earliest types of electric cells ever made. 4.3.1 Voltaic cell A Voltaic cell, also known as Galvanic cell, is shown in Fig. 4.7. It contains two metal plates made of different materials and a liquid called an electrolyte, placed in a glass or plastic container. The plates, called electrodes, are partly dipped in the electrolyte, which is usually a weak acid or salt solution. A chemical reaction between the plates and the electrolyte produces electricity. When the circuit is connected, electric current flows from the positive terminal through the circuit to the negative terminal. Over time, the chemicals get used up, and the cell stops working. It is then called ‘dead’ and cannot supply any more electricity. Ever heard of ... The Voltaic or Galvanic cells get their names from two Italian scientists, Alessandro Volta and Luigi Galvani. In the late 1700s, Galvani noticed that a dead frog’s leg kicked when touched with two different metals — copper and iron. It was already known by then that electricity could stimulate muscular motion and Galvani thought the electricity came from the frog itself. But Volta had a different idea. He believed the electricity came from the metals, and not the frog. To test this, he used saltwater-soaked paper instead of the frog’s leg and still got an electric current. This showed that it was the combination of metals and liquid that generated electric current — leading to the invention of the first battery!

A glowing LED indicates that your cell is working. In this cell, the metal electrodes are the copper wires and the iron nails. The electrolyte is the lemon juice, which helps conduct electricity. You may also use salt solutions instead of lemon juice. A step further Some common metal pairs for Voltaic cells are zinc/copper, zinc/ silver, aluminium/copper, iron/copper, magnesium/copper, and lead/copper.

Instead, dry cells are one of the most widely used electric cells today. They are called ‘dry’ because the electrolyte is not a liquid but a thick moist paste. The structure of a dry cell is shown in Fig. 4.9. It consists of a zinc container which acts as a negative terminal and a carbon rod at the centre covered with metal cap that acts as the positive terminal. The carbon rod is surrounded by the paste-like electrolyte. The dry cell is a single use cell, meaning once it is used up, it has to be disposed of. For several applications, rechargeable batteries are increasingly being used now. 4.3.3 Rechargeable batteries Rechargeable batteries can be recharged and reused multiple times.

Because of this, countries are now racing to secure supplies, recycle old batteries, and develop new technologies. Scientists are also working on the next big leap: solid-state batteries, which replace the liquid or paste-like electrolytes with solid materials.

Sonali and Ragini were excited to go cycling. Their summer vacation had just begun, and they wanted to explore the beautiful landscapes around their village. After pumping air into their bicycle tyres, they set off. As they rode through the village, the wind rushed past them. “Oh no! The wind is pushing me hard!” said Ragini. Smiling, Sonali replied, “We are riding against the wind. We must push our pedals harder to move faster.” Their ride took them up a long path to a hilltop. Some parts of the road were rough where they found it hard to pedal, while other parts were smoother. When they reached the top and were enjoying the view, they heard thunder and saw flashes of lightning at a distance. Even though it looked beautiful, they decided to head back immediately. On the way back, while passing a herd of sheep, they pressed their bicycle bells and turned the handles to change direction. As they were coming down the slope of the hill, they realised that their bicycles were moving down at a great speed even though they were not pedalling! Sonali yelled, “It’s thrilling!

This contact can be direct, such as using our hands or other body parts, or indirect, such as using a stick or rope. Forces of this type which act only when there is physical contact between the objects are called contact forces. Muscular force An example of contact force is muscular force. When we perform any physical activity, such as walking, running, lifting, pushing, jumping, or stretching, the force is caused by the action of muscles in our body. The force resulting due to the action of muscles is known as muscular force. Muscular force occurs when muscles contract and elongate while doing any activity. Animals, birds, fish, and insects use muscular forces for movement and survival."}

This force helps us chew food and push it through the alimentary canal during the process of digestion. The expansion and contraction of our heart muscles allows the blood to circulate in our body — a process essential for survival. Friction A ball rolling on a flat ground stops on its own after some time. If we stop pedalling our bicycle on a flat road, it slows down and comes to a stop. If the road is rough, it stops sooner than on a smoother road. You must have come across many such experiences. What causes the change in the speed of objects in such situations? We have learnt earlier that a force is essential to change the speed of an object. However, in all these situations no force appears to be acting on the objects, yet their speed gradually decreases and they come to a stop after some time. Is it possible that some force is indeed acting on them? Which force is that?

{"class": "class 8", "subject": "science", "page_no": 88, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "68 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 On pushing, the object stops after sliding a certain distance. This must be due to a force acting between the surfaces of the sliding object and the table or floor which are in contact. This force must be acting on the object in a direction opposite to its direction of motion. This force is what brings the object to a stop. The force that comes into play when an object moves or tries to move over another surface is called the force of friction or simply friction. Friction always acts in a direction opposite to the direction in which the object is moving or trying to move. The force of friction is a contact force since it arises due to two surfaces in contact. Friction arises due to the irregularities in the two surfaces in contact. Even surfaces which appear smooth, have a large number of minute irregularities (Fig. 5.6). When placed in contact, the irregularities of two surfaces lock into each other and oppose any effort to move one surface over the other. Fig. 5.6: Friction between two surfaces due to irregularities Fig. 5.5: Friction acts between two surfaces and opposes the motion of the object. Activity 5.4: Let us explore z Try Activity 5.3 again, but this time place the same object on different surfaces, such as glass, cloth, wood, ceramic tile, and sand. z Does the object stop after travelling the same distance as in Activity 5.3? z Does the object stop at the same distance on all surfaces? For different surfaces, the object stops after moving different distances so we can say that the force of friction depends upon the nature of the surfaces in contact. Friction is greater on rough surfaces. A step further Does the force or friction act only if the objects are moving on solid surfaces? What about objects moving through liquids and gases? Air, water, and other liquids also exert force of friction on the objects moving through them. Hence the objects, such as aeroplanes, ships, boats, or high-speed trains are designed with specific shapes to reduce the force of friction due to the air or water around them. Does this mean that the force of friction will be greater if the surfaces are rough?"}

We learnt that a magnet attracts objects made of magnetic materials. When two magnets are brought close to each other, like poles (North–North, South–South) repel each other while unlike poles (North–South) attract each other. In an earlier chapter of this book, we also learnt about electromagnets which behave like magnets. Attraction and repulsion between objects are also a form of push and pull, that is, a force.

Do you notice something surprising? The paper pieces get pulled towards the plastic scale/straw and stick to it when it is brought close to paper pieces. Why does this happen? When two objects of certain materials are rubbed together, electrical charges build up on their surfaces. These charges are called static charges as they do not move by themselves. The object that acquires static charges is said to be a charged object. A charged object attracts, that is, exerts a force on uncharged objects made of certain materials, such as small pieces of paper. This force comes into play even when the bodies are not in contact.

Since the balloons were charged in the same way, we can say that they have acquired similar charges. As the similarly charged balloons repelled each other, we can infer that similar (like) charges repel each other. Both the rubbing object and the rubbed object get charged but they acquire opposite kind of charges. Their attraction shows that opposite kind (unlike) of charges attract each other. The two kinds of static charges are said to be ‘positive’ and ‘negative’. The force exerted by a charged body on another charged body or an uncharged body is called electrostatic force.

The force with which the Earth attracts objects towards itself is called the gravitational force. The gravitational force exerted by the Earth is also called force of gravity or simply gravity. Since the gravitational force acts without contact with the object it attracts, it is a non-contact force. Gravitational force is always an attractive force, unlike magnetic force or electrostatic force, which can either be attractive or repulsive. You might have noticed that when an object is dropped from a height, it takes a straight vertical path downwards before touching the ground (Fig. 5.11a). When an object is thrown vertically upwards, the object moves up straight, slows down, stops momentarily at the top, and then takes a straight vertical path downwards (Fig. 5.11b). While going up, the speed of the object goes on decreasing till the object comes to a stop, its direction of motion changes and while coming down the speed goes on increasing. We say that the object undergoes a vertical motion when it moves in a vertical direction under the influence of the gravitational force. 5.5 Weight and Its Measurement The force with which the Earth pulls an object towards itself is called the weight of the object. The weight measures how strongly an object is pulled by the Earth. Since the weight is a force, it is measured in the same unit as that of force. Therefore, SI unit of weight is also newton (N).

Activity 5.9: Let us explore z Take a spring and a few objects of different masses, such as a pencil box, a tiffin box, and a small stone. z Hang one end of the spring from a nail. From the other end, hang an object and observe the spring. Does the spring stretch? z Now hang the other objects, one by one and notice the stretch in the spring each time. Is the stretch caused by each object the same? When an object is hung from a spring, the spring stretches due to the force applied on the object by the Earth. We find that the stretch caused in the spring is different for different objects. This indicates that the Earth pulls different objects with different forces, that is, the weight of different objects is different. Can we use the spring to measure the weight of an object? A step further A spring balance is a simple device used to measure weight (force). It consists of a spring fixed at one end, with a hook attached at the other end. When we hang an object from the hook, the spring stretches, and the amount of stretching gives the weight of the object. There is a scale on the balance which is marked to show the weight (force) in newton. Usually, there is also another scale to show the corresponding values of mass in gram (g). These values have been marked with the assumption that the spring balance is used on the Earth, with the Earth’s gravitational force attracting the object. (b) Fig. 5.12: (a) A hanging spring; (b) Two different objects hung from the spring (a) Let us learn to measure the weight using a spring balance. But first, let us familiarise ourselves with a spring balance the way we did with thermometer earlier (in the chapter ‘Temperature and Its Measurement’ in Curiosity, Grade 6). Activity 5.10: Let us observe z Look at the spring balance shown in Fig. 5.13 carefully. What is the maximum weight it can measure? The maximum weight it can measure is 10 N. Thus, this scale has a range of 0 to 10 N."}

A step further The mass of an object can be measured indirectly by measuring its weight (using a spring balance) or by comparing its weight with the weight of an object of a known mass (using a beam balance). Since the weight of an object remains almost the same everywhere on the Earth, so for all practical purposes it is acceptable to weigh an object to find its mass. As we have learnt earlier (in the chapter ‘Materials Around Us’ in Curiosity, Grade 6), mass is the amount of matter in an object and is measured in grams (g) or kilograms (kg). Its value remains the same at every place. Weight, on the other hand, is the gravitational force with which the Earth (or another planet) pulls an object. Since gravitational force can vary very slightly from place to place on the Earth (and can be very different on different planets), weight can change, but mass does not. What is the difference between weight and mass? A step further The gravitational force of different planets on an object is different. Thus, the weight of an object is different on different planets, as shown in the following table, even though its mass remains the same. Planet Earth Moon Mars Venus Jupiter Mass of the object 1 kg 1 kg 1 kg 1 kg 1 kg Weight of the object 10 N 1.6 N 3.8 N 9 N 25.4 N A step further In everyday life, particularly for the goods we commonly use, we are more interested in the amount of matter in an object (its mass), rather than the force applied by the Earth upon it (its weight). However, though while the units of mass are used, instead of the term mass, the term weight is typically used. For example, it is said that the weight of the wheat bag is 10 kg. But in scientific use, this is not correct and it is important to use the correct terms with their correct units, even if every day language is more casual."}

Do you feel an upward push? Release the bottle. Does it bounce up? You would have felt an upward push and the bottle bounces back to the surface of the water. This indicates that water applies a force on the bottle in the upward direction. In fact, all liquids apply a similar force. The force applied by a liquid on an object in the upward direction is known as upthrust or buoyant force. When an object is placed in a liquid, the gravitational force due to the Earth acts on it downwards. But a buoyant force is applied on it by the liquid in the upward direction. If the gravitational force is more than the buoyant force, the object sinks, but if the two forces are equal, the object floats. One of the factors on which the buoyant force depends upon, is the density of the liquid. You will learn about density in a later chapter of this book. Fig. 5.15: Plastic bottle in water A step further Archimedes, a famous Greek scientist, discovered that when an object is fully or partially immersed in a liquid, it experiences an upward force which is equal to the weight of the liquid it displaces. This is known as Archimedes’ Principle. If the weight of a liquid displaced by an object is smaller than the weight of the object, the object will sink in the liquid. If the weight of the liquid displaced is equal to the weight of the object, the object will float in the liquid. 5.6 Floating and Sinking While taking out water from a bucket filled with water using a mug, do you notice that the mug feels lighter when it is inside water? Let us try to understand this. If we place some objects on water, some of them float, while others fall to the bottom. The gravitational force of the Earth is acting on all objects, then why don’t all objects fall to the bottom? Ever heard of ... There are some rocks which can float on water. One such rock is Pumice, which is formed during volcanic eruptions. When lava with lots of gas and water vapour cools quickly, it traps tiny bubbles of gas inside. This creates a light, porous rock — filled with air pockets which is less dense than water and floats on it."}

Have you ever wondered why fallen leaves rise in the air or trees sway or bend? Does the wind exert force on fallen leaves to make them rise or on trees to bend? Recall other similar effects of the force exerted by wind like slamming of doors or rattling of windows, or fluttering of clothes? How does the force exerted by wind make this happen? The force exerted by wind creates wind pressure which causes these effects. In this chapter, we will explore the relationship between force and pressure, and understand how they shape powerful natural events like thunderstorms and cyclones. 6.1 Pressure Megha and her brother Pawan are going on a picnic. They walk to the picnic spot, carrying identical items in their bags (Fig. 6.1). On the way, Pawan keeps adjusting his bag, and looks uncomfortable. Megha asks, “Is there a problem with your bag?” Pawan responds, “Yes, it is hurting my shoulders.” Megha says, “Both our bags are equally heavy. Why does your bag hurt, and mine doesn’t?” Pawan reflects for a minute and says, “Perhaps, it is because of the difference in the straps of our bags. My bag has narrow straps while your bag has broad straps.” Can the shape or size of the straps really make a difference? Let us try to find out. When we carry a bag, we feel its weight because of the force of gravity acting on our shoulders. The weight of the bag with narrow straps acts on a smaller area of our shoulders, whereas the weight of the bag with broad straps is spread out over a larger area of our shoulders. It is due to this reason that we feel more comfortable carrying a bag with broader straps than one with narrow straps, although both bags have the same weight. Since the area over which the force acts is involved, we define a quantity called pressure, which is the force per unit area. So, Pressure = Force Area At this stage, we will consider only those forces which act perpendicular to the surface on which the pressure is to be computed.

{"class": "class 8", "subject": "science", "page_no": 102, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "82 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 Broad straps reduce the pressure exerted by the bag on our shoulders as compared to narrow straps. Therefore, we feel more comfortable carrying a bag with broad straps. Can you now understand why it feels easier to lift a water-filled bucket with a broad handle than with a narrow handle (Fig. 6.2)? Similarly, we have seen that when people carry loads like pots or vegetable baskets on their heads, they often place a round piece of cloth under the loads (Fig. 6.3). In both cases, the objective is to reduce pressure by increasing the area over which the weight acts. Pressure is defined as the force per unit area. The SI unit of force is newton and that of area is metre2. Therefore, the SI unit of pressure is newton/metre2 (N/m2). This unit is also called a pascal, denoted by Pa. If a force of 100 N is applied on a cardboard of area 2 m2, then the pressure applied on the cardboard will be: Pressure = = 50 N/m2 = Force Area 100 N 2 m2 There are many situations in daily life where pressure plays a role.

Notice that because of the different diameters, the weight of water in the two pipes is different. However, the bulge in both the balloons is the same. This means that the weight of water in the pipes could not be responsible for the extent of the bulge of the balloons. Could it be that the water column is exerting pressure? Yes, it is the pressure exerted by the water column which is responsible for the bulge. That is why equal water column heights produce equal bulges in the balloons, despite their different diameters.

Observe the bulge of the balloon. Repeat this process a few times, adding more water each time and noting the extent of bulge as shown in Fig. 6.6. Do you see any relation between the amount of bulge of the rubber balloon and the height of the water column in the pipe? You must have observed that the bulge of the balloon increases as the height of the water column increases. Thus, as the height of the water column in the pipe increases, the pressure at the bottom of the pipe also increases, which causes the balloon to bulge more. So, we can say that the pressure exerted by a liquid in a vessel depends on the height of its column. This is the reason why overhead tanks are placed at a height so that the pressure in the taps is increased, resulting in a good stream of water from the taps.

What can you infer from this observation? It indicates that water also exerts pressure on the sides of a container. Therefore, we can conclude that liquids exert pressure not only at the bottom of the container, but also on its sides. In fact liquids exert pressure in all directions. You must have seen water spurting out like a fountain from leaking joints or holes in water pipes. Can you explain why this happens? Is it due to the pressure exerted by water on the walls of the pipes? Ever heard of ... Do you know that the base of a dam is much broader than the top? This is because a broad base not only supports the structure of the dam, but also withstands the horizontal water pressure near the bottom (Fig. 6.8). The water stored in the dam, exerts pressure horizontally on the side walls of the dam and vertically on the floor due to the height of the water level. The pressure which acts horizontally, is very large near its bottom. Thus, to withstand the pressure, the base of the dam is made broader. Fig. 6.8: Dam Let us now try to understand if air also exerts pressure. 6.2 Pressure Exerted by Air You already know that air is all around us. The envelope of air surrounding the Earth is called atmosphere. The atmospheric air contains nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, and other gases in small quantities.

Cover the paper plate with the unfolded chart paper as shown in Fig. 6.9 c. z \u0007Lift the paper plate again and feel the effort needed in doing so. z In which case is the lifting easier, with the folded or the unfolded chart paper covering the paper plate? You would have observed that more effort is needed to lift the paper plate when it is covered with the unfolded chart paper, than with the folded chart paper. When we cover the paper plate with unfolded chart paper, the area of the covering sheet increases. The effort needed to lift the paper plate increases. Notice that the weight of the covering sheet has not changed. What can you infer from this? We can infer from these observations that air exerts force on the covering sheet, which makes it difficult to lift the paper plate. Moreover, this force increases with Fig. 6.10: A girl blowing a balloon Fig. 6.9: (c) Inverted paper plate with unfolded chart paper Fig. 6.9: (b) Inverted paper plate with two folds of chart paper increase in the area of covering sheets. It means that the air is exerting a force on the paper plate, which increases as the area of the sheet covering it increases. As force per unit area is pressure, we can conclude that air exerts pressure on the paper sheet. In fact, air exerts pressure on all objects. The pressure exerted by air around us is known as the atmospheric pressure. You must have experienced that when you blow air into a balloon, it gets inflated. Why? This is because the air being filled inside the balloon exerts pressure on the walls of the balloon (Fig 6.10). Can we say that air exerts pressure in all directions? Yes, that is why the balloon expands in all directions. What happens when an inflated balloon is kept without closing its mouth? The air escapes from the balloon. Why does the air escape from the balloon?"}
{"class": "class 8", "subject": "science", "page_no": 107, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "Chapter 6 — Pressure, Winds, Storms, and Cyclones 87 Have you ever wondered how large the atmospheric pressure is?

Press it firmly against a smooth flat surface (Fig. 6.11). z Do you realise that it sticks to the surface? z Now, try to pull it off. Do you find it difficult to pull it off? When we press the sucker, most of the air between its cup and the surface on which it is placed is pushed out and the air pressure inside it is reduced. The sucker sticks to the surface because the pressure of air surrounding the sucker is higher than the pressure exerted by the air inside the sucker. To pull the sucker off the surface, the applied force should be strong enough to overcome the pressure difference between outside the sucker and inside the sucker. Do you know how large the atmospheric pressure is? The force exerted by the atmospheric air column over an area 15 cm × 15 cm is nearly equal to the force of gravity on an object of mass 225 kg (2250 N). The reason we are not crushed under this weight is that the pressure inside our bodies is also equal to the atmospheric pressure. This balances the pressure exerted from outside. The pressure inside our body is caused by the movement of fluids and gases in tissues and organs of the body. 6.3 Formation of Wind You must have noticed that on some days, the wind blows strongly, whereas on other days, it is calm. Sometimes, wind becomes so strong that it causes damage to life and property. You must have seen that when an inflated balloon is kept without closing its mouth, the air from the balloon escapes. Recall that when there is a puncture in the bicycle tube, the air escapes and the tube collapses. In both of these cases, does air move from a high pressure region to a low pressure region? The SI unit of pressure is N/m2, also known as pascal (Pa). However, the practical unit of air pressure is millibar (mb), which is equal to 100 Pa. Air pressure is also expressed in hectopascal (hPa), which is equal to 100 Pa. Fig. 6.11: A sucker A step further"}

Now you have one end of the straw inside the inflated balloon and the other end inside the uninflated balloon as shown in Fig. 6.12. z Predict what would happen to the balloons. z Observe what happens to both the balloons. Did it happen as predicted? z Do you observe any change in the size of the balloons? Write down your observations. .................................................................................................................... What can be the reason for the change in the sizes of the balloons? The air pressure in the inflated balloon is higher than that in the uninflated balloon. As a result, some air moves from the inflated balloon to the uninflated balloon, resulting in changes in the size of both the balloons. Do you notice that after some time both the balloons attain almost the same size and the flow of air stops? Why does the air flow stop? The flow of air continues till the air pressure in the inflated balloon is higher than the air pressure in the uninflated balloon. The air flow stops when the pressure in both balloons becomes equal. At this stage, both balloons are almost of the same size. Thus, we can conclude that air moves from a region of high air pressure to a region of low air pressure. You can relate this conclusion to the directions of the sea breeze and land breeze, which you studied in Curiosity, Grade 7. As land gets heated faster than water during the day, the air above the land How do winds form? Does the difference in air pressure have anything to do with the formation of winds?

At night, the water is warmer than the land. Therefore, a low pressure area develops above the sea. As a result, wind blows from the land to the sea, giving rise to land breeze. Thus, the phenomenon of land breeze and sea breeze is mainly due to the pressure differences over the land and the sea.

Therefore, the air pressure above the roofs of the houses is lower than the pressure below them. If the pressure difference is large and the roofs are weak, they may be blown away, as shown in Fig. 6.14 a. That is why it is safer to keep doors and windows of the houses open during storms with high-speed winds. When the same wind moves over the roofs, and through the houses, the pressure difference between inside of the houses and over the roofs is reduced to a large extent. This helps prevent the roofs from being blown off as shown in Fig. 6.14 b. You must have experienced that when high-speed winds blow during storms, they are sometimes accompanied by thunder and lightning. Let us learn more about them. 6.5 Storms, Thunderstorms, and Lightning Fig. 6.14: (b) Roof of a house intact Fig. 6.14: (a) Roof of a house blown away Have you heard the sound of thunder and seen lightning during the rainy season? Yes, the sound of thunder is so frightening! Usually there is heavy rainfall too. When land gets heated, the warm and moist air, being lighter, rises, thereby creating a low pressure area. Cooler air from the surrounding high-pressure areas flows to take its place. This air, in turn, gets heated and rises. This results in a continuous process of wind circulation. As the rising air expands, it cools and moisture in it condenses to form water droplets, creating clouds. The water droplets merge to form heavier drops, which come down as rain, hail, or snow. The strong winds accompanied by rain is called a storm. In hot, humid, and tropical regions like India, storms are more frequent. Under certain conditions, warm air rises to great heights that the low temperature there converts water droplets into ice particles. Strong winds blowing upwards and downwards (Fig. 6.15) facilitate rubbing between water droplets Fig. 6.15: Strong winds going up and down Warm air Cool air"}

You have learnt in the chapter ‘Exploring Forces’ that when two objects are rubbed against each other, they get charged. In this case, strong winds blowing upwards and downwards and rubbing against each other cause static electric charges to develop within the clouds. The positively charged lighter ice particles move upwards and occupy the upper part of the clouds. The negatively charged heavier water droplets occupy the lower part of the clouds. Thus, a charge separation within the cloud takes place. Also, when the negatively charged lower part of the cloud moves closer to the ground, it causes the ground and nearby objects, such as trees or buildings, to become positively charged (Fig. 6.16). Normally, air acts as an electrical insulator and does not let opposite charges meet. But when the build up of charges becomes very large, the insulating property of air breaks down. A sudden flow of charges takes place, producing a bright flash of light called lightning. Lightning can occur as opposite charges collide within a cloud, between clouds, or between clouds and the ground. Lightning rapidly heats up the air around it, causing the air to expand and produce a loud sound known as thunder. A storm accompanied by lightning and thunder is called a thunderstorm. A step further Isolated and localised thunderstorms can sometimes occur in various regions of India. These thunderstorms are known by various names such as Kalboishakhi in West Bengal, Bihar, and Jharkhand and Bordoisila in Assam. They occur before the arrival of the monsoon, thereby helping kharif crops to grow. In Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu, they are known as mango showers as they support the ripening of mangoes. Local thunderstorms in Karnataka help in the growth of coffee plants. Lightning can be dangerous! It can ignite fires, damage buildings, and cause severe burns or death in humans and animals. We must take necessary precautions and protect ourselves from lightning. During lightning, stay away from tall objects, find a low-lying open area and crouch down, and minimise contact with the ground. Do not lie down flat. Avoid using an umbrella with a metallic rod. If you are in water, get out of it. If you are inside a bus or a car, you are comparatively safer. Fig. 6.16: Lightning"}

A lightning conductor is a metallic rod installed along the walls of buildings during their construction. One end of the rod is pointed. This end is kept higher than the highest point of the building (Fig. 6.18). The other end of the rod is buried deep in the ground. The rod provides easy path for the transfer of electric charges into the ground. Lightning conductor Fig. 6.18: A lightning conductor 6.6 Cyclone Cyclones are large storms that form over warm ocean waters. As the ocean water gets heated, the warm and moist air above it rises. As the moist air rises, the water vapour condenses to form raindrops. We know that during evaporation, water takes up heat to change into vapour. When this water vapour condenses into raindrops, heat is released back into the atmosphere. This causes further warming of the ascending air leading it to rise even further, creating an even lower pressure. Air from the surrounding regions rushes in and it also starts rising. Earth’s rotation causes the moving air to spin (Fig. 6.19). This cycle is repeated, resulting in the creation of a very low-pressure area with high-speed winds revolving around it. This spinning system of clouds, winds, and rain is called a cyclone. In a cyclone, the region of lowest pressure is at the centre, known as the eye of the cyclone. At the eye of the cyclone, the wind is calm, but the surrounding region experiences strong winds and heavy rainfall. As a cyclone moves from the ocean towards the land, it generates higher wind speeds compared to the wind speeds produced by regular thunderstorms. Once the cyclone reaches land, the source of moist air is cut off and it gradually loses its strength.

Cyclones can be extremely destructive. For example, the Amphan cyclone in 2020 had peak wind speeds of 270 km/h. Strong winds during a cyclone push ocean water towards the shore, creating a wall of water that can be as high as 3–12 metres. This surge of water can flood coastal areas and even areas far from the sea. The heavy rainfall which accompanies a cyclone may cause rivers to overflow and can also trigger landslides. Seawater that rushes inland can contaminate drinking water sources and damage farmland. The salt in seawater can make soil less fertile, affecting crops. Roads may get blocked due to fallen trees and debris, making it difficult for help to reach the affected areas. Power outages can last for days, disrupting emergency services and daily life. How can we protect ourselves during cyclones? It is important to stay updated on weather reports and periodic alerts, and warnings issued by the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Thanks to the weather monitoring satellites, today we can track cyclones and predict their path, helping us reduce their impact on life and property. Several national and international organisations work together to monitor cyclone-related disasters. If you live in a cyclone-prone area, keep an emergency kit ready with essential items. During a cyclone, quickly move to a nearby designated cyclone shelter. Let us wrap up! Cool air rushes to occupy the low-pressure area. Warm air rises, creating a low-pressure area. Warm air rises, cools, and the water vapour condenses to form clouds. Bigger water drops in the clouds fall to the ground as rain, hail, or snow. Positive and negative charges are created in the clouds by strong winds blowing upwards and downwards. Under certain weather conditions, storms may develop into cyclones. When positive and negative charges meet, they cause lightning. Lightning may occur within a cloud, between clouds, or between a cloud and the ground."}

These units are called constituent particles of chalk. A constituent particle is the basic unit that makes up a larger piece of a substance or material. Just like chalk, the grains of sand and clay are not the smallest units of bigger rocks. These are also made up of a large number of their constituent particles. Let us explore further!

The tiny sugar particles separate and occupy the available spaces between the water particles. These spaces between the particles are known as interparticle spaces. Chalk and sugar can both be broken down into their constituent particles. But how are the constituent particles held together to form the solid pieces we see? 7.2 What Decides Different States of Matter? The constituent particles of matter are held together through forces which are attractive in nature. These forces are called interparticle attractions. The strength of these attractions depends on the nature of the substance and the interparticle distance. Even a slight increase in the distance decreases the interparticle forces drastically. The strength of these forces ultimately decides the physical state of the substances.

You must have noticed that all these objects are solids. They have a definite shape and volume. This is due to the fact that in solids, the particles are tightly packed and the interparticle attractions are very strong. These strong forces of attraction hold the particles in fixed positions, preventing them from moving freely (Fig. 7.4a). The particles can only move to and fro about their positions (vibrate or oscillate) but cannot move past each other. When solids are heated, their particles vibrate more vigorously (Fig. 7.4b). A stage is reached when these vibrations become so vigorous that the particles start leaving their position. The interparticle forces of attraction get weakened and the solid gets converted into the liquid state (Fig. 7.4c). The temperature at which this happens is the melting point of the solid.

You will notice that the water takes the shape of the container into which it is poured. So, we can say that the liquids do not have a fixed shape and take the shape of the container they are kept in. This happens because the particles of liquids are free to move. In all three containers, the water level remains at 200 mL and no change in volume is observed. Hence, we can say that liquids have a definite volume. However, if a container is not clean, some water may stick to its walls, causing the water level in the next container to be slightly less than 200 mL after pouring.

When you try this, you are temporarily displacing water. As soon as you remove your finger, the position of the water is restored. We can say that in liquids, the interparticle attractions are slightly weaker than in solids, but still strong enough to keep the particles close together. Recall Curiosity, Grade 6 chapter ‘Temperature and Its Measurement’, where you observed the temperature of boiling water (liquid). When a liquid is heated, a stage comes when it starts boiling. The temperature at which a liquid boils and turns into vapour at atmospheric pressure is called its boiling point. The movement of particles becomes so vigorous that they move apart from each other, resulting in a decrease in the interparticle forces of attraction. Eventually, the constituent particles can escape from the liquid state. The liquid is converted into vapour or the gaseous state. At the boiling point, the formation of vapour is very fast and occurs not only at the surface but also within the liquid. This process is observed as bubble formation in the liquid. However, vapour formation occurs at all temperatures, even below the boiling point, though slowly and only at the surface. This slower process is known as evaporation — about which you have learnt in earlier grades. 7.2.3 Gaseous state Do gases also have a fixed volume?

As a result, gases do not have a fixed shape or volume. In this activity, smoke is used to represent the gaseous state. The tiny particles of smoke suspended in the air are constantly hit by invisible particles of gases, and their movement helps us observe the motion of gas particles. This activity can also be demonstrated by using iodine vapour instead of smoke from incense sticks.

When added to water, the sand particles settle down and occupy some space in the container, causing the total volume to increase. What do you think about the interparticle spacing in solids? You learnt earlier that the constituent particles in solids are held together by strong forces of attraction. So, these particles do not move from one place to another and are closely packed. However, despite close packing, some space is left between the particles as shown in Fig. 7.12a. You might assume that the space between particles is filled with air, but this is not the case. They contain nothing at all. Fig. 7.12 summarises the packing of particles and the interparticle spacing in the three states of matter. A step further Often, we use the term ‘particle’ in different contexts. The meaning of this term changes with the context. For example, while talking about air pollution, the term Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) is used. This term refers to the tiny dust particles suspended in air and not the constituent particles of matter which are extremely small as compared to the dust particles. In fact, even these tiny dust particles are also made up of a very large number of constituent particles, i.e, atoms and molecules. 7.4 \u0007How Particles Move in Different States of Matter?

This happens because the water particles are in constant motion. First they pull out the particles of potassium permanganate from its grain, and later they hit these particles so that they get spread throughout the liquid. In the case of many substances, the constituent particles are held together strongly that the water particles are unable to pull these out. Such substances, like sand, are insoluble in water.

The strength of attractive forces between particles depends on the distance between them, which in turn depends on their thermal (heat) energy. Thus, it is the thermal energy of the particles that determines the physical state of matter. In the solid state, the thermal energy of particles is low, so they remain close to each other and experience strong interparticle attractive forces. This restricts their motion to only small vibrations. At the melting point, the thermal energy is used to overcome the attractive forces between particles, allowing the solid to change into a liquid. At this stage, the particles can move away from their fixed positions. The interparticle distance increases slightly, reducing the strength of the attractive forces to a level that allows the particles to move around, though still within a limited space. In the gaseous state, the particles have enough energy to overcome the forces of attraction between them and move freely in all directions.

The staircase you use, the air you breathe, the water in your bottle, the food in your lunch box, the clothes and shoes you wear, the book you read, the trees outside, the ball you play with and even the stick you carry — all of these are examples of matter, which you have learnt in earlier grades. You have also learnt that all these things are made up of tiny particles. Most of the things around us are not made of just one substance; rather they are made up of two or more substances mixed together. Let us now understand how different substances come together to form mixtures. 8.1 What Are Mixtures? Have you ever wondered what makes your poha (Fig. 8.1) so delicious or how to make the perfect sprout salad? While these dishes may seem very different, they share something in common—they are both made by mixing several ingredients. We observe the mixing of substances in everyday life. Sugar dissolved in water is also a mixture, and so are soups and lemonade. When two or more substances are mixed, where each substance retains its properties, it is called a mixture. The individual substances that make up a mixture are called its components. The components of a mixture do not react chemically with each other. In some mixtures, the components — like green gram, chickpeas, onion, and tomato in a sprout salad (Fig. 8.2), are easy to see. Such mixtures, where the different components are generally visible with the naked eye or with a magnifying device, are non-uniform in nature. Can you identify a few more examples of non-uniform mixtures around you? On the other hand, some mixtures have components that cannot be seen separately even with the help of a microscope. For example, sugar and water particles cannot be seen separately in their mixture. Such types of mixtures, where the components are evenly distributed and cannot be distinguished, are uniform in nature (Fig. 8.3). Can you list a few uniform mixtures?

Our scientific heritage 8.1.1 Is air a mixture? In Curiosity, Grade 6, you learnt about air and its composition in the chapter ‘Nature’s Treasures’. Is air a mixture? What kind of mixture is it? You have learnt that air is a uniform mixture of mainly nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, and water vapour. Out of these, oxygen is required by most of the living beings to stay alive. It also helps in combustion. Nitrogen, which constitutes about 78% of the air, does not take part in combustion. We also learnt that air has water vapour in it. When warm air touches a cool surface, the water vapour turns into liquid water, forming tiny droplets. Recall the experiment where you tested the presence of carbon dioxide in the air that we exhale. Let us confirm the presence of carbon dioxide in the air. Activity 8.1: Let us experiment z Take a glass tumbler and fill it half with water. z Add a small amount of calcium oxide (quick lime) slowly to it. z What do you observe? z Calcium oxide reacts vigorously with water to form calcium hydroxide and releases heat.

Adulteration is an illegal process of adding substances which are cheaper, or of a poor quality, to a product. This is usually done to increase the quantity or reduce the manufacturing cost. However, it deteriorates the quality of the product. It can also make the product hazardous to health. Fig. 8.7: Some consumable items"}

Each element is made up of identical particles called atoms. These particles are different from the particles of any other element. Elements are substances that cannot be further broken down into simpler substances. They are the building blocks of all matter. Some other examples of elements are gold, silver, sulfur, carbon, etc. The atoms of most of the elements cannot exist independently. Two or more such atoms combine and form a stable particle of that element called a molecule. For example, two atoms of hydrogen combine to form one molecule of hydrogen. Similarly, two atoms of oxygen combine to form one molecule of oxygen (Fig. 8.10). A step further Elements can be classified into metals and non-metals. You have already studied that gold, silver, magnesium, iron, and aluminium are metals, whereas carbon, sulfur, hydrogen, and oxygen are non-metals.

In water, the particles of hydrogen and oxygen are so tightly attached to each other that it is generally impossible to separate them apart using physical methods. That is why water is a compound. Compounds are formed when different elements combine in fixed ratios to form something entirely new. The properties of compounds are different from those of elements forming that compound. The constituent elements of a compound cannot be separated by any physical method. From Activity 8.3, we find that molecules of water are made of two different elements: hydrogen and oxygen (Fig. 8.11), combined chemically in a fixed ratio. The ratio of the number of atoms of hydrogen to oxygen in water has been found to be 2:1. Are common salt and sugar elements or compounds? Let us find out. Sodium, a soft metal, and chlorine, a hazardous gas, combine to form a harmless yet taste-enhancing substance that is essential for our lives.

Sample A: We can say that Sample A is a mixture of the two elements—iron and sulfur. Its components retain their properties, and their black and yellow coloured particles can be seen. On bringing magnet near Sample A, the iron filings get attracted towards the magnet. Hence, iron and sulfur can be separated. You might have observed that in Sample A, iron in the mixture reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid to form iron chloride and hydrogen gas. The gas is colourless, has no smell, and burns with a ‘pop’ sound. The reaction can be represented as — Iron + Dilute Hydrochloric acid Iron chloride + Hydrogen gas Sulfur on the other hand, is left as a yellow solid at the bottom of the test tube. This shows that sulfur does not react with hydrochloric acid.￼ Sample B: The black mass obtained in Sample B is iron sulfide. We observe that the texture and the colour are the same throughout. It is formed by heating the two elements, iron and sulfur. It is not attracted by a magnet. The new substance has completely different properties, and iron and sulfur can no longer be separated.

Elements like iron and aluminium are used to construct bridges, buildings, and vehicles. Understanding these concepts is not just about recognising what surrounds us; it is also the key to innovation. For instance, chemists study how elements combine to create compounds, enabling them to invent life-saving medicines and vaccines to fight diseases. This knowledge also helps in the creation of fertilisers thereby enhancing crop production that feeds the ever-increasing human population globally. Engineers and material scientists rely on their understanding of compounds and mixtures to design materials with unique properties. For example, they have developed alloys like stainless steel, which is stronger and more durable than pure iron. Wood, steel, and concrete, which are used as building materials, are all mixtures. You learnt that various metals are obtained from minerals. Let us learn about these minerals. An example of a ‘wonder’ material developed by material scientists is graphene aerogel. This is made from carbon and is said to be the lightest material on earth. It is so light that even grass can hold it (Fig. 8.21). It is highly porous and therefore, has a high absorbing capacity. For this reason, it can potentially be used as an environmental cleaner, for example, to clean up oil spills in both seas and on land. It is useful in fabricating energy-saving devices and special coatings for buildings. Fig. 8.21 A step further 8.5 What Are Minerals? Most rocks are a mixture of minerals, which can be viewed with the eyes, or by using a magnifying glass or a microscope. Some of the minerals are called native minerals, which are pure elements and not compounds. These can be metals, such as gold, silver, copper, etc., or non-metals like sulfur, carbon, etc. Most of the minerals are compounds made up of more than one element. Some common examples of minerals include quartz, calcite, mica, pyroxene, and olivine (Fig. 8.22). Many things that we use in our everyday life are made up of minerals or elements extracted from minerals. For example, cement is made from calcite, quartz, alumina, and iron oxide, which are minerals or are obtained from minerals. Talcum powder is made from the mineral talc. Pyroxene Olivine Talc Quartz Calcite Mica Fig. 8.22: Some minerals"}

The process begins with shaping a design in beeswax. This wax model is covered with clay to make a mould. After the clay hardens, the wax is melted out, leaving a hollow space. This space is then filled with molten brass or bronze which makes Dhokra art strong and gives it a shiny golden colour.

ORS is used to treat dehydration by keeping your body hydrated. You have learnt to prepare ORS at home in Curiosity, Grade 6. You may have wondered why every sip of your homemade ORS tastes the same, no matter how much you drink. Why does it not taste salty in one sip and sweet in another? This is because when you add sugar and salt to water, they form a mixture in which the components are evenly distributed throughout. Can you predict whether this mixture is uniform or not (Fig. 9.1)? What happens when chalk powder is mixed with water—does it form a uniform mixture? When salt and sugar are mixed with water, a uniform mixture is formed, whereas when chalk powder or sand, or sawdust is mixed with water, the components are not evenly distributed. Such mixtures are known as non-uniform mixtures (Fig. 9.2a and 9.2b). Let us explore the science of mixing things together. 9.1 What Are Solute, Solvent, and Solution? A uniform mixture, such as that of salt or sugar, and water, is called a solution. Whenever a solid is mixed with a liquid to form a solution, the solid component is called the solute, and the liquid component is called the solvent. The solute dissolves in the solvent to form a solution (Fig. 9.3). Solute + Solvent Solution When a solution is formed by mixing two liquids, it is not always clear which substance is dissolving the other. In such cases, the substance present in smaller amount is called the solute, while the one in larger amount is called the solvent. We know air is a mixture. Would a mixture of gases also be considered a solution? Just as water can act as a solvent in liquid solutions, gases can also form solution — with air being a common example. Air is a gaseous solution. Since nitrogen is present in the largest amount in the air, it is considered as the solvent, while oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, and other gases are considered as solutes.

After adding a few more spoons of salt, a stage comes when the added salt does not dissolve completely and the undissolved salt settles at the bottom. This indicates that the water can no longer dissolve any more salt because it has reached its limit. The solution in which more solute can be dissolved at a given temperature, is called an unsaturated solution (Fig. 9.5). However, when the solute stops dissolving and begins to settle at the bottom, the solution is called a saturated solution at that particular temperature (Fig. 9.6). The amount of solute present in a fixed quantity of solution (or solvent) is termed as its concentration. Depending upon the amount of solute present in a fixed quantity of solution, it can be called a dilute solution (less amount of solute) or a concentrated solution (more amount of solute). Dilute and concentrated are relative terms. So, one can say in Activity 9.1, the solution obtained by dissolving one spoon of salt is dilute as compared to that obtained by dissolving two or more spoons of salt. Can you now reflect — which solution is more concentrated; 2 spoons of salt in 100 mL of water or 4 spoons of salt in 50 mL of water?

We can also say that a saturated solution at a particular temperature behaves as an unsaturated solution if the temperature is increased.

Oxygen dissolves in water only to a small extent. Even though present in minute quantities, it is this dissolved oxygen that sustains all aquatic life, including plants, fishes, and other organisms. Is the mixture of gases in water a uniform or non-uniform mixture? It is a uniform mixture because the gases dissolve evenly in water to form a solution. Does temperature affect the solubility of gases in liquids also? If so, how? It has been observed that the solubility of gases generally decreases as temperature increases. More oxygen can dissolve in cold water, ensuring sufficient oxygen for aquatic life (Fig. 9.8). On the other hand, when water warms up, the solubility of oxygen decreases. Now I understand that the mixtures we use can be of two types—uniform and non-uniform. Uniform mixtures are called solutions, and their components are not visible separately. In non-uniform mixtures, the components can be seen either with the naked eye or with a magnifying device.

You must have observed that some objects float while others sink in water (Fig. 9.9). You may have noticed that, while washing rice, husk particles present in the rice float on the surface of water while rice sinks to the bottom of the container. Why does this happen? If you add oil to water, it floats on water. Generally, it is believed that objects that float in a liquid are lighter and others that sink are heavier than the liquid. A wooden stick and an iron rod may be of the same size, yet the iron rod feels much heavier. When we say that iron is heavier than wood, we are referring to a special property known as density, which describes the heaviness of an object. Note However, the density of a substance is not the only factor that decides whether it will float or sink in a particular liquid. Let us explore further. 9.5 What Is Density? Imagine a crowded bus where many people are packed together — this is an example of high density whereas, the same bus with only a few people is an example of low density. Similarly, a forest where trees grow close to each other is called a dense forest (Fig. 9.10a), but if the trees are far apart (Fig. 9.10b), it is considered less dense. How do scientists define density? Let us find out. We have learnt that matter is anything that possesses mass and occupies space (volume). Density is defined as the mass present in a unit volume of that substance. The density of a substance may be expressed mathematically using the formula: Density = Mass Volume The density of a substance is independent of its shape or size. However, it is dependent on temperature and pressure. Pressure primarily affects the density of gases, while its effect on solids and liquids is negligible.

What does this tell us about the density of the oil, and is it less or more than that of water? The units in which density is expressed will depend upon the units of mass and volume taken. As you have learnt, the SI units of mass and volume are kilogram (kg) and cubic metre (m3), respectively. Therefore, the SI unit of density is kilogram per cubic metre, abbreviated as kg/m3. In case of liquids, other units of density are also used for convenience, such as gram per millilitre, abbreviated as g/mL and gram per cubic centimetre, abbreviated as g/cm3. Conversion factor for density 1 kg/m3 = 1000 g/m3 = 1000 g/1000 L = 1 g/L = 1 g/1000 mL = 1 g/1000 cm3 The mass of 1 mL of water is close to 1 g at room temperature. For the measurement of the mass of water, we generally consider the volume in mL and its mass in g. Hence, 10 mL of water would be approximately 10 g. Similarly, 100 mL of water would be approximately 100 g. Suppose the mass of an aluminium block is 27 g and its volume is 10 cm3, its density is 2.7 g/cm3. From this, it can be said that aluminium is 2.7 times denser than water. We express this fact by saying that the relative density of aluminium with respect to water is 2.7. It is a number without any units. = Density of that substance Density of water at that temperature Relative density of any substance with respect to water 9.5.1 Determination of density The density of an object can be determined by measuring its mass and volume. How to measure mass? You learnt the term ‘mass’ in Curiosity, Grade 6. Mass is the quantity of matter present in any object. The instrument used to measure the mass of an object is known as a balance. You must have seen various types of balances being used by shopkeepers. Here, we are using a digital weighing balance to measure the mass. You learnt in chapter ‘Exploring Forces’ that on Earth, weight and mass are closely related."}

A step further As mentioned in Chapter 5, the words ‘mass’ and ‘weight’ are often used interchangeably in everyday language. But they have different meanings in science, which can sometimes cause confusion. Mass is the quantity of matter present in an object or a substance. Its units are gram (g) and kilogram (kg). On the other hand, weight is the force by which the Earth attracts an object or a substance towards itself, and it is measured in newtons (N). Most balances (except two-pan balances like in Fig. 9.13) actually measure weight, but their scales are marked in mass units, so they show values in grams or kilograms (Fig. 9.12c).

A tetra pack says it contains 200 mL buttermilk (chach) (Fig. 9.14). What does that mean? You learnt in Curiosity, Grade 6 that volume is the space occupied by an object. You also know that the SI unit of volume is cubic metres, written as m³. It is the volume of a cube whose each side is one metre in length. Volume of smaller objects is conveniently expressed in a decimetre cube (dm3) or centimetre cube (cm3). One centimetre cube is also written as one cc. Volume of liquids is expressed in litres (L) which is equivalent to 1 dm3. A commonly used submultiple of a litre is millilitre (mL) which is equivalent to 1 cm3. One of the common apparatuses used to measure the volume of liquids is a measuring cylinder. It is a narrow transparent cylindrical container with one side open and the other side closed as shown in Fig. 9.15. There are markings on the transparent body of the cylinder that indicate the volume of liquid in the measuring cylinder. We can use it to measure the desired amount of a liquid. Measuring cylinders are available in different sizes to measure volume — 5 mL, 10 mL, 25 mL, 50 mL, 100 mL, 250 mL, etc (Fig. 9.15). How accurately can these measuring cylinders measure?

The smallest volume that the measuring cylinder can read is__________. For the measuring cylinder shown in Fig. 9.16, the volume difference indicated between 10 mL and 20 mL, or between 40 mL and 50 mL, is 10 mL. The number of divisions between these marks is 10. So, one small division can read 10 ÷ 10 = 1 mL. That is, the smallest value that this measuring cylinder can read is 1 mL. The smallest volume that a measuring cylinder can measure depends on the capacity of the measuring cylinder. Usually it is 0.1 mL in smaller measuring cylinders with a capacity of 10 mL or 25 mL, it is 1 mL in a 100 mL measuring cylinder, 2 mL in a 250 mL measuring cylinder, and 5 mL in a 500 mL measuring cylinder.

On the other hand, if a 250 mL or 500 mL measuring cylinder is used, the measurement can be done in one step but the accuracy would be reduced as the smallest volume that these measuring cylinders can measure is greater than that of a 100 mL measuring cylinder. Hence, a 100 mL measuring cylinder is the best choice for this measurement. Activity 9.5: Let us measure 50 mL of water z Place a clean, dry measuring cylinder on a flat surface. z Pour water slowly into the measuring cylinder up to the required mark, as shown in Fig. 9.17. z If required, adjust the level of water in the measuring cylinder by adding or removing a small amount of water using a dropper. z On careful observation, you will notice that the water inside the measuring cylinder forms a curved surface. This curved surface is called the meniscus (Fig. 9.18). z Read the mark on the measuring cylinder that coincides with the bottom of the meniscus for water or other colourless liquids.

Did you know that our planet, Earth, is composed of several layers, such as crust, upper mantle, lower mantle, outer core, and inner core, each with its particular range of density? The outermost layer, called the crust, is the lightest and the density of the different layers increases as we move towards the centre (Fig. 9.20). As one moves deeper into the Earth, both the pressure and the temperature rise significantly, making the materials heavier and more compact. Ever heard of ... In ancient times, before large ships were invented, people used bamboo and wooden logs to travel across rivers and seas (Fig. 9.21). Bamboo was used because it is light, hollow, and floats easily on water. People tied bamboo poles together to make rafts and small boats for fishing, trading, and crossing water bodies. Wooden logs, especially from strong trees were either hollowed out to make boats or used as rafts. These simple boats, made from locally available materials, were important for moving around and connecting different places. Even today, similar traditional boats made of bamboo or wood are used in some regions—not just for transport, but also as tourist attractions. Fig. 9.21: Bamboo raft floats on water 9.5.2 Effect of temperature on density Generally, the density of a substance decreases with heating and increases with cooling. This can be explained on the basis of what you have learnt in chapter ‘Particulate Nature of Matter’. As temperature increases, the particles of a substance whether, solid, liquid, or gas, tend to move away and spread. This results in an increase in volume but there is no change in mass. Since the Density = Mass/Volume, upon heating, the volume increases and the density decreases. This explains why hot air moves up as it is less dense than the cool air around it. The hot air balloon works on the same principle (Fig. 9.22). Fig. 9.20: Layers of Earth Crust Upper mantle Lower mantle Outer core (liquid) Inner core (solid) Fig. 9.22: Rising of hot air balloons"}

For gases, increasing pressure causes the particles to move closer together. As a result, the volume of the gas decreases and its density increases. In the case of liquids, pressure has a small effect because they are nearly incompressible. We have learnt in chapter ‘Particulate Nature of Matter’ that the particles in solids are very close to each other. So, how is the density of solids affected when pressure is applied? Solids are even less affected by pressure than liquids, and changes in their density are usually negligible. Ever heard of ... Why does ice float on water? Ice floats on water because it is lighter than liquid water (Fig. 9.23). Water has a special property that its density is highest at 4 °C. It means water is heaviest at 4 °C. As the temperature drops, and water turns into ice at 0 °C, it undergoes a change in structure—the particles arrange themselves in a way that takes up more space. This process is called expansion. Because the same amount of water now occupies a larger volume, its density decreases. As a result, ice becomes lighter than liquid water and floats on its surface. This is important for animals living in lakes and oceans because ice floats, it forms a layer on top, keeping the water underneath warm enough for fish and other creatures to survive, even in extremely cold weather.

The centre had many fascinating displays on nature, space, and technology. While her parents explored a section on saving water and electricity, Meena and her brother wandered off to look around. In one corner, Meena noticed a row of unusual, curved mirrors. Curious, she stepped closer and looked into one. Her face appeared unusually large, while her brother, standing a little farther away, looked upside down! At another mirror, she saw a tiny version of herself. Meena was puzzled. She remembered doing activities with a mirror earlier where the image formed by the mirror was of the same size as the object and was erect (in the chapter ‘Light: Shadows and Reflections’ in Curiosity, Grade 7). Seeing her confusion, a guide from the science centre walked up to her and smiled. “These are not plane mirrors,” the guide explained. “These are spherical mirrors. When the mirror is curved inward or outward, your image looks different in them!” Meena’s curiosity grew and she decided to talk to her teacher about these spherical mirrors. 10.1 What Are Spherical Mirrors? Activity 10.1: Let us explore z Take a shiny metallic spoon and hold its curved surface close to your face. Can you see your image in it? z Notice the image of your face. Is it different from the image you see in a plane mirror? z While observing the image, slowly move the spoon away from your face. Do you observe any change in the image? z Now flip the spoon and repeat the same steps. Did you notice that the shiny metallic spoon acted like a mirror and you could see your image in it? When you looked at the inner side of the spoon which is curved inwards, you must have observed that the image was inverted (Fig. 10.1a). When you looked at the outer side of the spoon which bulges outwards, the image of your face was erect but smaller in size (Fig. 10.1b). Curved mirrors, like the spoon, can also be specially made. Spherical mirrors are a common type of curved mirrors which are shaped like a part of a hollow glass sphere. Mirrors, whose reflecting surfaces are spherical are called spherical mirrors.

However, remember that spherical mirrors are not made by slicing a hollow glass sphere. Instead, they are created by grinding and polishing a flat glass piece into a curved surface.

However, when the object is moved farther away, the image becomes inverted. Initially, the image is enlarged in size and then keeps getting smaller. In case of a convex mirror, the image is always erect and smaller than the object, that is diminished. However, the size of the image decreases slightly as the object is moved away from the convex mirror. This activity shows that spherical mirrors (concave and convex) behave differently from plane mirrors. A plane mirror always forms an erect image of the same size as the object. However, in the concave and convex mirrors, the size of the image changes as the distance of the object from the mirror changes. In addition, in the case of a concave mirror, the image also gets inverted when the object is taken away from the mirror. Lateral inversion of the image is seen in all three types of mirrors. I just got an idea. We can also identify whether a mirror is plane, or concave, or convex by looking at the images of an object formed in them! Yes. But where do we find concave and convex mirrors being used in our surroundings? The reflectors of torches, headlights of cars and scooters are concave in shape (Fig. 10.6a). Have you ever noticed a dental mirror used by a dentist for inspecting teeth? It is a concave mirror which provides an enlarged view of teeth when held close to the teeth inside the mouth (Fig. 10.6b). A step further Do you remember learning about the use of telescope in the chapter ‘Beyond Earth’ in Curiosity, Grade 6? Most modern telescopes are reflecting telescope that use curved mirrors, with the main mirror being a large concave mirror. Look at the side-view mirrors on vehicles. These mirrors are convex. They always form an erect image of the traffic behind and smaller than the actual vehicles.

To understand this better, let us draw this on a paper, step by step. But before doing that, let us learn how to represent light. We often represent light by straight lines with arrows, or rays. Rays indicate the path along which light travels. Do you remember learning earlier that the light travels along a straight line? z Draw a line showing the position of the plane mirror. Also, draw lines with arrows (rays) indicating the beam of light falling on the mirror and the reflected beam of light as shown in Fig. 10.9a. The ray of light that falls on the mirror is called the incident ray. The ray of light that comes back from the mirror is called the reflected ray. z Now remove the mirror. From the point where the incident ray strikes the mirror, draw a line making an angle of 90° to the line representing the mirror. This line is known as the normal to the reflecting surface at the point of incidence, O (Fig. 10.9b). The angle between the normal and the incident ray is called the angle of incidence (i) (Fig. 10.9c). The angle between the normal and the reflected ray is known as the angle of reflection (r) (Fig. 10.9c). z On your drawing, measure the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection and note it in Table 10.1. z Repeat the activity several times by changing the angle of incidence. z Finally, let the incident beam fall on the mirror along the normal and observe the direction of the reflected beam.

Direct the light of the Sun reflected by the mirror on the sheet of paper. z Adjust the distance of the paper until you get a sharp bright spot on it as shown in Fig. 10.12. z Hold the mirror and the sheet of paper steady for a few minutes. Does the paper start to burn producing smoke? The bright spot is formed on the paper because light from the Sun, after reflection from the mirror, gets concentrated on this point. This produces sufficient heat at this point which can ignite the paper. A step further Devices which concentrate sunlight into a small area, using mirrors and lenses, are called solar concentrators. The concentrated sunlight is used to heat a liquid to produce steam which can be used to generate electricity or for providing heat for various purposes, such as large scale cooking or for solar furnaces. Solar furnaces are even used for melting steel! Do you remember learning in an earlier chapter, about electric furnaces for melting steel?

But would those objects continue to look the same if the surface of the transparent material is curved? Activity 10.8: Let us explore z Collect a flat strip of glass or clear plastic, such as a flat scale, few drops of oil, dropper, water, and a paper or book with some text printed on it. z Spread a few drops of oil on the surface of glass or plastic strip and rub it to leave a very thin coating. You can also use wax instead of oil. z Using a dropper or your finger, place a small drop of water on the oiled/waxed spot. (The oil/wax helps the water form a nice round drop.) z Examine the water drop. What is the shape of its surface? Is it flat or curved inward or curved outward? z Place the paper underneath the glass/plastic strip such that the text is directly under the water drop (see Fig. 10.13). z Now, look down through the water drop at the text below. Do you find some change in the size of the letters just below the water drop? Do they look enlarged or smaller? The surface of the water drop is curved outside. The letters under the water drop look different — they might appear larger than the letters nearby! The curved surface of the water drop made the size of the text look different. This curved drop of water is acting like a simple lens. Have you seen a magnifying glass as shown in Fig. 10.14? It is also a lens that helps in reading small print by making the letters appear bigger. A lens is a piece of transparent material, usually made of glass or plastic, which has curved surfaces. Like mirrors, lenses can also be convex or concave. A lens which is thicker at the middle as compared to the edges is called a convex lens (Fig. 10.15a).

Also, the Moon did not appear like a full circle, but that didn’t surprise her as much. She knew its shape changed every night. Still, it got her thinking.

The bright portion continues to shrink for another week until it is no longer visible. This two-week period is called the waning period of the Moon. Different names are given to the Moon’s visible shapes during this cycle (Fig. 11.2). The day when the Moon appears as a full bright circle is called the full Moon day (or Purnima), and the day when it is not visible is called the new Moon day (or Amavasya). After the new Moon, its bright side grows to a half circle in about a week and to a full circle (full Moon) in another week.

In India, the waning period of the Moon is generally called the Krishna Paksha, while the waxing period is called the Shukla Paksha. The Moon goes through a waning period followed by a waxing period in a cyclical manner as shown in Fig. 11.2. The cycle from one full Moon to the next takes about a month. The changing shapes of the bright portion of the Moon from one day to another as seen from the Earth are called the phases of the Moon. 11.1.2 Locating the Moon When you checked the Moon at the same time on successive days (for example, at sunrise), did you see it in a different part of the sky? On a full Moon day, the Moon is nearly opposite the Sun — when the Sun rises in the East, the Moon is almost setting in the West. On subsequent mornings at sunrise, as its bright part continues to decrease, the Moon appears to move closer in the sky to the Sun. When the bright part of the Moon decreases to a half circle shape, the Moon is overhead at Sunrise. A few days later, the crescent Moon appears even closer to the Sun. Knowing the phase of the Moon and whether it is waxing or waning can thus help us find out where and when to look for the Moon on any given day. A waxing Moon is easiest to spot at sunset, and a waning Moon at sunrise. Because of these shifts, the Moon always rises and sets at different times than the Sun. A step further Many people believe the Moon rises when the Sun sets, but that is not always true. Look in a local newspaper or on the Positional Astronomy Centre (India Meteorological Department) website to find the moonrise time in your area. Check these times for several days in a row and you will see that the Moon rises about 50 minutes later each day. Sometimes moonrise happens in the afternoon (around 2:00 – 4:00 p.m.), so you can spot the Moon in the eastern sky during daylight. You may need to wait about 30 minutes past the listed moonrise time for the Moon to climb high enough for it to be seen. The time and position of moonrise changes from one day to the next. 7 April 2025 14:23 8 April 2025 15:17"}

You may recall learning earlier that the Moon does not emit light of its own, but shines because it reflects sunlight that falls on it. The half of the Moon that faces the Sun receives sunlight and becomes illuminated (Fig. 11.3). The other half facing away from the Sun does not receive sunlight and remains non-illuminated. The Moon revolves around the Earth and, only one half of the Moon always faces the Earth. However, the portion of the Moon facing the Earth is not always its illuminated part. We can only see the illuminated portion of the Moon from Earth. Sometimes, the entire illuminated portion of the Moon faces the Earth, and at other times only a part of it. At such times the illuminated portion of the Moon that we see is not a full circle. On New Moon day, we do not see the illuminated portion of the Moon at all, as only the non-illuminated portion of the Moon faces the Earth. Therefore, the Moon appears different on different days.

Earth needs to rotate some more for the Moon to appear in nearly the same spot in the sky. A step further The Moon phases do not happen due to Earth’s shadow. It is an incorrect explanation for the Moon’s phases that Earth’s shadow falls on it. As we have learnt, the phases of the Moon occur due to the relative change in orientation of the Sun, Moon, and Earth as the Moon revolves around the Earth. The Earth’s shadow on the Moon causes a lunar eclipse, not the Moon’s phases as we learnt earlier (in chapter ‘Earth, Moon and the Sun’ in the Curiosity, Grade 7). Lunar eclipses can only happen on a full Moon day and solar eclipses can happen only on a new Moon day. But they do not occur every month because of the small tilt of the Moon’s orbit with respect to the Earth’s orbit around the Sun.

We have learnt earlier that when viewed from the Earth, the Sun appears to rise in the eastward direction, set in the westward direction every day, and rise again the next day. This apparent periodic motion of the Sun seen by us is primarily due to the rotation of the Earth around its own axis. This natural cycle of the Sun due to the rotation of the Earth, is the foundation of the day, a unit to measure time. The average time that the Sun takes to go from its highest position in the sky on one day to the highest position in the sky the next day, is 24 hours, and is called the mean solar day. The highest position of the Sun in the sky can be found by measuring the length of the shadows cast by an object during the day. The shadow is shortest when the Sun is at the highest point in the sky. Activity 11.3: Let us measure a day! z Find a small flat area in a ground which receives sunlight during the day. Fix a 1 m stick vertically in it as shown in Fig. 11.7. z Start observing at 11:00 a.m. Every minute, mark a dot on the ground at the tip of the stick’s shadow. Keep marking dots until around 1:10 p.m. z Identify when the shadow was shortest and find out its time by counting the number of dots. Record this time in Table 11.2. Repeat this exercise for the next few days. z Find the duration of the solar day by finding a difference in time on two consecutive days as shown in Table 11.1. So, changing phases of the Moon is a natural periodic event, with a cycle of almost a month, which can also be used for time keeping. Yes, along with the natural periodic events of day and night and the changing seasons about which we learnt earlier. But how are these periodic events used for keeping time?

Is it nearly equal to 24 hours? The phases of the Moon give us another natural cycle with a duration that is longer than a day. The Moon takes about 29.5 days (nearly a month) to cycle through all its phases. The cycle of the phases of the Moon is the basis for a month, another unit to measure time (Fig. 11.8). The next larger unit to measure time is related to the natural cycle of seasons. Do you remember learning earlier that the Earth revolves around the Sun and takes nearly 365 and a quarter days to complete one revolution around the Sun? The Earth undergoes one cycle of seasons during this time, which can be used to define a solar year (Fig. 11.8). 11.2.1 Lunar calendars In ancient times, people had noticed that during one cycle of seasons, one can fit nearly 12 cycles of the phases of the moon, that is, 12 lunar months. This is how lunar calendars came into being, with the day as the shortest unit, a month of nearly 29.5 days, and a lunar year consisting of 12 lunar months. The phases of the Moon thus gave an easy and a perfectly sound way to track the passage of time. However, in a lunar calendar the seasons do not remain synchronised to the same lunar months in successive lunar years. The reason is that the seasons repeat in approximately 365 days while the lunar year is 354 days long. Fig. 11.8: The Earth goes around the Sun, and the Moon revolves around the Earth in regular intervals of time.

This need for a year to synchronise with seasons led to the creation of solar calendars. The Gregorian calendar, widely used today, is a solar calendar. The months in solar calendars are adjusted to add up to 365 days. That is why in Gregorian calendars, some months have 30 days, others 31, and February has only 28 days. On top of the 365 days, the Earth takes nearly an extra quarter of a day to complete one revolution around the Sun. These extra hours add up to approximately one day every four years. To adjust for this, solar calendars add an extra day every four years using the concept of a leap year. In the Gregorian calendar, if a year is divisible by four, then an extra leap day is added. So in a leap year, February has 29 days, which keeps the calendar well synchronised with the seasons. A step further The Earth takes slightly less time than 365 and a quarter day to go from one spring equinox to the next spring equinox. Adding a day every four years helps to synchronise with the seasons, but it actually adds a little too much over time. To fix this, leap years are skipped every 100 years—like in 1700, 1800, and 1900. But skipping all of them would make the calendar lag slightly behind. So every 400 years, a leap year is again added back—like in 1600 and 2000. These careful corrections keep the calendar closely matched with the seasons over long periods of time! A step further As we learnt earlier, seasons are caused by the Earth’s revolution around the Sun and its movement from the spring equinox to winter equinox and back. The time between successive spring equinoxes is called the tropical year. Gregorian calendar is based upon tropical year. We have also learnt earlier that the stars that rise at sunset change throughout the year due to the Earth’s revolution around the Sun. The time duration required for the same stars to rise again at sunset is called the sidereal year, and it can also be used to define a solar calendar. The sidereal year is longer than the tropical year by a mere 20 minutes, and so it takes a long time before the differences between the two calendars become noticeable. In modern times, astronomers use the sidereal year to keep track of the Earth’s position in its orbit around the Sun."}

The 12 lunar months add up to 354 days and thus fall short by nearly 11 days compared to the solar year. Thus every 2–3 years, Our scientific heritage For thousands of years, people — including those in India — have been observing the sky and developing calendars. People in ancient times did not know that Earth revolves around the Sun, and lacked modern instruments. Yet through years of careful sky observations, they noticed patterns and cycles in natural events. Hence, they could determine that the length of the year was approximately 365 days allowing them to create calendars. For example, careful observation reveals that the Sun does not always rise exactly in the East. In summer, it rises a little northward of East and in winter a little southward of East. These extremes happen on the solstices, around June 21 and December 21 each year. The Sun’s apparent northward movement from December to June is called Uttarayan, and its apparent southward movement from June to December is Dakshinayan. This cycle repeats every year and is closely linked to the changing seasons. The Taittirīya Saṁhitā records it in the verse 6.5.3: तस्‍‍माादाादि�त्‍‍य: षण्माासाा दक्षिि±णेनैति� षडुत्तरेण । “Thus the Sun moves southwards for six months and northwards for six months.” In the past, the equinoxes and solstices were also tracked by identifying the stars that rose at sunset. Ancient Indian texts like the Surya Siddhanta noted that the pattern of stars, Capricorn (called Makar in India), would be in the background of the Sun around the winter solstice during those ancient times. भाानोोर्मकरसंंस्‍ङ््क्राान्तेःः3 षण्माासाा उत्तराायणम्् । कर्क्‍का��ा�देस्तुु तथैव स्याात् षण्माासाा दक्षिि±णाायनम्् ।।9।। Translation: From the moment of the Sun’s entrance into the constellation of Capricorn, six months make up its northward progress (Uttarayana), so likewise from the moment of entrance into the constellation of Cancer, six months are its southward progress (Dakshinayana). Over the years, different types of calendars have evolved based on specific needs. A number of these calendars are used in different parts of India to track time and celebrating festivals.

Many Indian festivals are tied to the phases of the Moon and hence are based on either lunar or luni-solar calendars. For instance, Diwali falls on the new Moon of the month of Kartika, Holi on the full Moon of Phalguna, Buddha Purnima on the full Moon of Vaisakha, Eid-ul-Fitr is celebrated after sighting the crescent Moon at the end of the month of Ramazan, while Dussehra is celebrated on the tenth day in the month of Ashwina. Hence, they occur on different dates in the Gregorian calendar in successive years. For festivals based on luni-solar calendars, the Gregorian calendar dates can shift, but this shift is typically less than a month. This is because the luni-solar calendars add the intercalary month every few years which correct for the difference between the lunar and the solar year. In contrast, purely lunar calendars do not account for this difference. Any festival celebrated according to the phases of the Moon, such as Eid-ul-fitr, therefore can occur in different months of the Gregorian calendar year after year. Why do most Indian festivals fall on different dates every year?"}

These festivals happen on almost the same date every year in the Gregorian calendar which is based on the tropical year. A long time ago, these festivals were tied to either a solstice or an equinox. Due to the small difference in the sidereal and tropical years, the dates of these festivals slowly shift away from the solstices/equinoxes. This shift is due to slow wobble of the Earth’s axis, similar to the movement of the axis of a wobbling top. This causes the dates of festivals based on the sidereal calendar to move ahead in tropical calendar. For example, Makar Sankranti moves ahead by one day every 71 years. Ever heard of ...

When vegetation is scarce and waterholes dry up in their natural habitat, elephants may wander in to nearby farms or plantations in search of food like bananas and sugarcane. This can lead to in crop damage and at times, even harm people and domestic animals. Changes in rainfall and temperature affect vegetation. Cutting down trees for constructing roads and buildings makes it worse. This leads to the shrinking and drying of forests, the natural home of animals. When forests cannot support wildlife, animals tend to move into human habitats. Elephants are adapted to forest life, but sudden changes make it hard for them to survive. Wildlife ecologists have identified and marked corridors in many parts of the country to allow safe movement of animals. These corridors correct forest habitats, enabling wildlife—such as elephants to travel in need between large forest areas without coming into conflict with human settlements.

Most likely, you may have seen many fish of the same kind. This group of fish of the same kind living together in a pond habitat is called a population of that particular fish.

In Activities 12.1 and 12.2, you observed that different group of organisms live together in a habitat. A community comprises different populations sharing the same habitat. The biotic components of a habitat, such as the plants, animals, and microorganisms together form the community. These organisms interact and depend on one another for survival. Ever heard of ... You may have seen brightly coloured flowers blooming around you. Have you ever looked closely at their parts? A flower has a stalk, green leafy structures called sepals, coloured petals and two reproductive parts. Carpels (female) and stamens (male). Stamens burst release yellow dust like pollen grains. Wind, ‘water insects, bats and birds helps carry pollen from the stamens to the carpels of the same and different flowers. This process is called pollination (Fig.12.2).

Think of a reason for these observations. z Compare the number of dragonflies, bees, and butterflies in both the ponds. Do you find any relationship between the number of dragonflies and bees/butterflies? We observed that in Pond A (with fish) the number of dragonflies were less as compared to Pond B. Why? z Fish eat dragonfly larvae, so ponds with fish had fewer dragonflies. Dragonflies usually eat flies, bees and butterflies With fewer dragonflies, more bees, flies, and butterflies were found. These insects help pollinate flowers from nearby areas moving pollen from one flower to another, which helps plants produce seeds. So, flowers near ponds with fish may produce more seeds than those near ponds without fish. z What does this study show? How does the population of fish in a pond affect the seed production in nearby plants? z This study shows how biotic components (fish, dragonflies, pollinators, plants) and abiotic components (temperature, water, nutrients) interact with and affect each other (Fig. 12.4). Similarly, can overfishing by humans change this balance?

Plants and animals also depend on each other for nutrition, respiration, and reproduction. These are interactions among the biotic components. Both types of interactions — among biotic components, and between biotic and abiotic components — are important for survival in any habitat.

From this, you can infer that the biotic components (plants, animals, and microorganisms) and the abiotic components (air, water, soil, sunlight, and temperature) in a habitat interact with each other to form an ecosystem. Organisms in an ecosystem interact with abiotic components for food, shelter, and protection in an ecosystem. Different communities of living organisms interact with abiotic components in an ecosystems. There are two main types of ecosystems in nature. Aquatic ecosystems include ponds, rivers, and lakes while terrestrial ecosystems include forests, farms or even large trees like banyan, mango, or pilkhan. Hence, ecosystems can be large or small. Can you find overlapping ecosystems in Fig. 12.6? Fig. 12.6 shows an overlap of different terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In this figure, you can see a small river (an aquatic ecosystem) along with mountains, forests, grassland, and farmland, which are examples of terrestrial ecosystems. Farmland is a human-made ecosystem. These ecosystems are interacting with each other at any given point. In Activity 12.4, we have seen the importance of the components and their interactions in an ecosystem. For example, sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water are essential for producing food in plants; soil provides medium and essential nutrients for plant growth; air provides oxygen for respiration in plants as well as animals; water is essential for all living organisms. This shows how living organisms depend on the non-living component of an ecosystem. Just as biotic components depend on abiotic components, abiotic components also depend on biotic components. For example, plants release oxygen during photosynthesis, roots hold soil in place and prevent erosion, and plants retain soil moisture and help cool the atmosphere. You can identify and study any ecosystem in your surroundings and observe different types of interactions among the biotic and abiotic components. While studying biotic interactions, notice how organisms depend on each other for food.

Reduction in fish population will have cascading effects and there will be less number of consumers in the pond. As a result, insects will increase in number. These insects will spread to nearby farmlands. This is how farmers will be compelled to use pesticides to grow their crops which may again adversely affect the environment. Further consequences may emerge in the form of other environmental issues. Plants die Less oxygen Fish die More insects Plants get damaged by pests Fig. 12.13: One change leads to another What happens when we intervene in nature? Activity 12.9: Let us read In the 1980s, India was a significant exporter of frog legs, especially of the Indian bullfrog (Hoplobatrachus tigerinus) (Fig. 12.14). This large-scale harvesting led to a decline in frog populations. Since frogs eat insects, their reduced numbers resulted in a rise in agricultural pests. This forced farmers to use more synthetic pesticides, which harmed the environment, soil and water quality, and affected the overall environmental and human health. The Government of India banned the export of frog legs to prevent further ecological damage. An ecosystem stays in balance when interactions among organisms and their environment keep populations and resources stable. This balance is dynamic, not fixed, and can be disrupted by natural or human-made changes. Fig. 12.14: Indian bullfrog Fig. 12.15: Competition among a community in an ecosystem 12.8 \u0007How Do Interactions Maintain Balance in Ecosystems? Besides feeding relationships, organisms also compete for common resources like food, water, physical space, or sunlight. This competition helps control population size and keeps the ecosystem balanced. Without it, one species could multiply too much causing an imbalance in the ecosystem (Fig. 12.15). There are other types of relationships too. Based on the example given in Fig. 12.16, what do you observe?"}

We have learnt that biotic components and abiotic components of an ecosystem depend on each other and support various life processes. Humans also benefit from ecosystems. For example, forests provide fresh air, fertile soil, food, fibres, timber, and medicines. Similarly, aquatic ecosystems provide water and food. Ecosystems also offer aesthetic and recreational value. This benefits and supports our well-being and shows how closely nature and humans are connected. However, when we overuse or misuse natural resources, we disturb the balance in nature. Now let us look at a real-life example of a threatened ecosystem — the Sundarbans."}

Located where the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers meet between India and Bangladesh, the Sundarbans’ forests and rivers are home to various flora and fauna, many of which are endangered. The Sundarbans protect us by slowing down strong winds and waves during storms and floods. The trees also absorb carbon dioxide from the air and release oxygen. Because of its importance, The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site in 1987. However, the Sundarbans (Fig. 12.17) are under a serious threat. Mangrove trees are being cut for fuelwood and farming. Illegal hunting and overuse of forest resources are a threat to the wildlife living there. Pollution from industrial waste and untreated sewage in rivers are also damaging the water and habitat. These human activities disrupt the natural way ecosystems work. Similarly, other ecosystems across India are also under threat. Problems like deforestation, overuse of natural resources, the spread of invasive species, unsustainable land use, and pollution are damaging forests, rivers, scrublands, wetlands, grasslands, and coastal areas. How can we stop damaging forests, rivers, and wetlands? Think about what actions you and your community can take to protect these important places. Protected areas are parts of land or water set aside to conserve wildlife and their habitats. India has many protected areas like national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, biosphere reserves, and community conserved areas. These places help protect entire habitats including endangered animals, birds, and many rare plants. Famous examples include Jim Corbett National Park (Uttarakhand), Manas National Park (Assam), Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve (Western Ghats), Chilika Lake (Odisha), Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary (Arunachal Pradesh), Hemis National Park (Leh), Keibul Lamjao National Park (Manipur), Pirotan Island Marine National Park (Gujarat).

When well designed, these can help reduce pollution, support biodiversity, and provide recreational spaces for people. Unlike natural ecosystems, these need human care and management. Can you name any human made ecosystem in your area? 12.9.2 How do healthy ecosystems serve our farms? Farming, a major livelihood in India, can become unsustainable if not managed well by applying environment friendly farming practices. Humans have been practising farming for thousands of years to grow food. As the population grew, our dependence on agriculture increased. Between 1950 and 1965, India faced a food crisis due to low crop production. In the mid-20th century, the use of tractors, machines, synthetic fertilisers, and pesticides helped increase food production. This period is known as the Green Revolution. However, these farming methods are now considered unsustainable because of the overuse of synthetic chemicals, excessive groundwater extraction, and growing only one type of crop for commercial gain. How do these practices harm both the environment and human health? Many scientists believe that overusing pesticides and growing the same type of crop repeatedly on the same land leads to soil degradation. Understanding ecosystems can help us adopt better and more sustainable farming practices. Activity 12.10: Let us survey Visit a nearby farm with your parents or teacher/interact with farmers in your community to find out about the farming practices they adopt. z Prepare a list of questions for farmers to find out the pesticides and other farm inputs they use, and whether they reuse or recycle materials to improve their crops.

Synthetic fertilisers and pesticides have played a vital role in improving crop production and helped countries like India become food secure. However, their long-term use can affect the environment and soil health. Overuse of synthetic fertilisers may reduce soil fertility by decreasing friendly microorganisms in soil and lowering organic matter (humus), which helps bind soil particles. Without enough humus, soil becomes prone to erosion. Also, it reduces the population of natural predators which ultimately increase the population of pests (Fig. 12.18). Heavy irrigation and repeated ploughing can also disturb soil organisms like earthworms and snails, which are important for maintaining ecological balance. Some pests may develop resistance to pesticides, making them difficult to control. Growing the same crop repeatedly, known as monoculture, can reduce crop diversity and affect pollinators, which are crucial for food production. To make farming more sustainable, some farmers are exploring organic and natural farming methods. These aim to reduce the use of synthetic fertilisers and support sustainable farming, with minimal interference in natural ecosystems. Based on your learning, what practices do you think can help farmers protect the soil, the environment, and our food security for the future?

As you have learnt in Curiosity, Grades 6 and 7, the Earth is a planet orbiting the Sun. However, it is not just any planet. It is a planet that sustains life — full of diverse landscapes, from towering mountains and vast oceans to endless deserts and lush forests. Today, our satellites allow us to take amazing pictures of our planet. The image in the beginning page was taken by an Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Earth Observation Satellite and made by combining nearly 3000 smaller images, like pieces of a mosaic. Although it looks beautiful, it’s a false colour image, where scientists use different colours to show different types of information. These satellite images help us study plants on land and tiny organisms in the ocean, and can even detect things like ocean temperature, oil spills, and wind direction. In this chapter, we will uncover the unique conditions that make Earth the perfect home for living beings. 13.1 Why Is Earth a Unique Planet? What makes the Earth so special? While there are perhaps billions of planets in the universe, Earth is the only one where life, as we know today, exists and thrives in all its forms. Have you ever wondered where all life on Earth actually exists? All the mountains, rivers, forests, animals, and people are found on just a very thin layer on the surface of our planet. From the tallest mountain to the deepest ocean trench, the crust, where all of life exists, is tiny compared to the size of Earth. If Earth were the size of an apple, the crust would be as thin as the apple’s skin as shown in Fig. 13.1. This delicate, life supporting layer is what makes Earth truly special. crust Fig. 13.1: The Earth’s crust is like the thin skin of an apple Crust Upper mantle Lower mantle Outer core Inner core"}

Table 13.1: Interesting features about the Earth Discuss the features you have listed with your teacher and friends. You may realise that the Earth is interesting and important to us in many ways. It provides us with the air that we breathe, the water that we drink, and the soil that helps in growing crops. The Earth also provides us materials like rock and timber with which we build our homes, buildings, and roads. You must be curious to know what makes the Earth a unique planet which not only allows life like us to exist but also sustains it. 13.2 \u0007What Do the Planets of Our Solar System Look Like? In Curiosity, Grade 6, you had studied the solar system in the chapter ‘Beyond Earth’. Let us recall some of the things we had learnt. Our solar system has eight planets that go around the Sun in nearly circular orbits. In order of their increasing distance from the Sun, they are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, I wonder what makes the Earth unique for living beings to grow and survive!"}

This is generally correct, except that Venus, the second planet from the Sun has the highest average temperature and is the hottest planet. Why is this so? Venus is the hottest planet not because it is the closest to the Sun, but because its thick atmosphere traps heat."}

This is called the greenhouse effect (Fig. 13.2), and it makes Venus even hotter than Mercury, which is relatively closer to the Sun. On the Earth also, gases like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere trap heat by absorbing the radiation given off by the Earth, after it gets warmed by the Sun. Thus, greenhouse effect plays an important role in maintaining just the right temperature on Earth. A step further The greenhouse effect that causes a planet like Venus and Earth to trap heat does not work the same way as a greenhouse for growing plants in a cool climate. On Venus or Earth, gases like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere trap heat by absorbing the radiation given off by the Earth, after it gets warmed by the Sun. A plant greenhouse, on the other hand, traps warmed air simply because it is a closed space, usually with glass walls (Fig. 13.3). It heats up during the day, but the air stays in and the heat does not escape easily. So while both keep things warm, they do it differently! Fig. 13.3: Greenhouse for plants 13.3 What Makes the Earth Suitable for Life to Exist ? 13.3.1 Position of the Earth The most important reason why the Earth can support life is its distance from the Sun. It is just at the right distance, where the temperature allows water to exist in a liquid form. If the Earth were closer to the Sun, it would be too hot and all the water would evaporate; if it were farther away, it would be too cold, and all the water would freeze. In such extreme conditions, it would have been impossible for most life forms — especially plants, animals, and humans — to grow and thrive on Earth.

Earth’s distance from the Sun allows water to remain mostly in liquid form, which is essential for the development and sustenance of life in all its form. The range of distances from the Sun (or another star) over which water remains liquid is called the habitable zone, or sometimes also called the ‘Goldilocks zone’ (Fig. 13.4). As you have also studied in Social Science, most of Earth’s surface is covered with water. Thus, when seen from space, the Earth looks blue because of the vast amount of water—hence the name Blue Planet (Fig. 13.5). Did Mars ever support life? Mars lies at the edge of the Sun’s habitable zone. Several spacecrafts have been sent to Mars, rovers have landed and explored its surface, but no proof of life has been found yet. However, scientists think that in the past, Mars may have had liquid water — maybe even some lakes — and conditions that could support simple life forms (Fig. 13.6). This is one reason Mars continues to interest scientists. It also reminds us that science doesn’t always have final answers. As we explore more, we may find new clues—or even new kinds of life. Science stays open to change when we learn more. Fig. 13.6: Mars A step further Is the temperature or distance from the Sun, the only factor that makes the Earth habitable?

However, moderate temperature due to the right distance from the Sun isn’t the only factor that makes the Earth habitable. The planet is also the right size to support an atmosphere. As you learnt earlier, the atmosphere is the layer of gases that surrounds the Earth, and it plays a major role in sustaining life. You also learnt in Chapter 5 that the Earth’s gravity pulls objects towards it. If Earth were much smaller (but with the same average density), its gravity would have been too weak to hold on to the gases in our atmosphere, and they would have escaped into space. On Mars, the atmosphere is 100 times thinner than on Earth, and Mercury has no atmosphere at all. On the other hand, if the planet was too large, and gravity was much stronger, it would perhaps pull us down to the planet with such a large force that our bones could get crushed! Due to the right size of the Earth, it is able to support atmosphere which is essential for life. The presence of oxygen in the Earth’s atmosphere allows us to breathe, and is needed by almost all forms of life on Earth. But oxygen has another important role. Some of the oxygen in our atmosphere, gets converted to another form called ozone (a three-atom oxygen molecule), and forms an important part of the atmosphere called the ozone layer. This layer acts like a shield, blocking harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays from the Sun that can damage living cells. Our scientific heritage India’s Mangalyaan (Mars Orbiter Mission), launched in 2013 by Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), was a big step in exploring Mars (Fig. 13.7). It carried tools to study the planet’s atmosphere, surface, and signs of past water. Some of these sensors help scientists ask big questions — like was Mars ever suitable for life? Mangalyaan showed the world that India could do space science with smart, low-cost technology — and it helped bring Mars closer to all of us. Fig. 13.7: Mangalyaan"}

This is because the Earth itself behaves like a giant magnet. You have also seen in Chapter 4 that the region around a magnet where its effect is felt has a magnetic field. It is believed that the movement of molten iron in Earth’s core may be the origin for Earth’s magnetic field. Earth is constantly hit by tiny, high-energy particles that come from space. Some come from far across the universe and are called cosmic rays. Other particles come from the Sun and are called the solar wind. These particles can be harmful as they can damage the atmosphere, reduce the ozone layer, and let in more harmful UV rays, which can affect life on Earth. Thankfully, the Earth’s magnetic field acts like a protective shield. It pushes many of these harmful particles away from the Earth, keeping our atmosphere, and hence life on our planet safe. Earth’s unique position in the solar system — allows the presence of liquid water — along with its size, atmosphere, and magnetic field, all help make it a planet where life can emerge and thrive. But, how is life supported and sustained on Earth? Does the magnetic field of the Earth have any role in sustaining life on Earth? 13.4 What Allows Life to Be Sustained on Earth? Earth has the right conditions for life, but it is the beautiful connections between living and non-living things that help life to thrive. In Curiosity, Grades 6 and 7, you learnt about key natural resources, such as, air, water, sunlight, soil, and minerals. You also learnt about the important life processes in plants and animals. Now, let us explore how all these elements interact to support and sustain life on Earth. 13.4.1 Air, water, and sunlight We know that the atmosphere contains oxygen, which humans, animals, and plants use for respiration. In the presence of sunlight, plants take carbon dioxide from the air and water from"}

In the process, oxygen is released, which is needed for respiration. We have learnt, radiation from the Sun heats the Earth. Some of this heat is trapped by the atmosphere due to the greenhouse effect. This effect though mild, keeps the temperature just high enough for water to remain in the liquid state. In Curiosity, Grade 7, you also learnt about heat transfer by radiation. Without an atmosphere, the Earth would lose heat to space and become too cold. So the greenhouse effect helps keep the Earth warm. Water is essential for life. You have learnt that it covers about 70 per cent of the Earth’s surface and is found in ponds, lakes, rivers, springs, seas, oceans, and groundwater. All this water forms the hydrosphere. In Chapter 7, you learnt that water is a good solvent. In Curiosity, Grade 7, we learnt how water transports nutrients from soil to leaves in plants. In animals, it regulates body temperature, aids digestion, and ensures hydration, all essential for health and life. Though much of Earth is covered by water, we still know little about what lives deep in the oceans. The hydrosphere is home to millions of life forms, from tiny planktons to giant whales, many still being discovered. Oceans, lakes, and rivers provide rich environments for aquatic life (Fig. 13.8). Freshwater is also needed to grow crops and support people around the world. Water vapour in the air forms clouds and brings rain or snow. This refills rivers, lakes, and underground water. Rainfall affects the kinds of plants and animals that can live in a place. Moving air also shapes weather and rainfall — which influence farming, water supply, and life on land. 13.4.2 Soil, rocks, and minerals Beneath our feet lies something remarkable — the Earth’s crust, made of rocks, soil, and minerals. It may seem hard and lifeless, but it provides almost everything life needs to grow and survive. From soil that helps plants grow to minerals that give us salt, coal, oil, and metals like iron and copper — this outer layer support both ecosystems and human life. The solid parts of the Earth, including materials like rocks, soils, and minerals are known as the geosphere. Soil may look like simple dirt, but it is rich in nutrients like nitrogen and potassium that plants need to grow. These nutrients come from the slow breakdown of rocks and the remains of plants and animals. Fig. 13.8: Life in water"}
{"class": "class 8", "subject": "science", "page_no": 239, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "Chapter 13 — Our Home: Earth, a Unique Life Sustaining Planet 219 There are various types of landforms, rocks, soils, etc., on Earth. This variety along with the processes that shape and alter them is called geodiversity (Fig. 13.9). It helps create unique habitats where different types of life can thrive. The non-living parts of nature, like soil, rocks, and water, aren’t just a background — they help shape the story of life itself. 13.4.3 Plants, animals, and microorganisms From the chapter on microbes to the chapter on ecology, we have seen that the Earth is full of life — from trees, shrubs, herbs, to animals, insects, and tiny organisms invisible to the naked eye. All living beings, along with the places where they live, make up the biosphere. This includes land, water, and air, where life interacts with its surroundings to survive and grow. As you learnt in Chapter 12, living beings depend on one another and their environment. Plants make food through photosynthesis, animals eat plants or other animals, and decomposers break down dead matter and return nutrients to the soil. Nature works together as a system to support life. 13.4.4 The importance of balance Have you ever wondered how so many things on Earth stay in balance? Earth is like a giant teamwork project between nature, weather, and life itself. It is a vast, living system where land, air, water, and living things support and affect one another. Even a small change in one part — like cutting down a forest — can impact rainfall, soil, air quality, and the animals that live there. Life on Earth survives not because of just one thing, but because everything works together in balance. It is this balance that keeps our planet habitable. That’s why preserving and protecting clean air, water, soil, and all forms of life isn’t just important but essential for keeping Earth healthy for the future. 13.5 What Keeps Life from Disappearing? If plants and animals didn’t reproduce, life would eventually disappear from Earth. Reproduction ensures that each type of organism continues to exist, maintaining the continuity of life. We usually expect that animals will produce young ones that resemble them — cows have calves, and cats have kittens. This happens because parents pass on instructions to their offspring about how to develop from a single cell. These instructions, Fig. 13.9: Geodiversity"}
{"class": "class 8", "subject": "science", "page_no": 240, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "220 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 called genetic material or genes, are stored inside every cell of a living being. You can think of genes as a detailed instruction manual inside each cell. Some instructions tell the cell how to make blood, while others guide the formation of bones, muscles, or skin. Together, these instructions ensure that a calf grows into a cow, or a kitten grows into a cat. But reproduction does more than just create more of the same kind of living beings. It also allows for small changes in the instructions that are passed down from parents to offpsrings. Sometimes, these changes help a plant or animal survive better in a new environment. For example, over time, camels developed humps to store fat and survive in deserts. Even microbes evolve — some bacteria, as you learnt in the chapter on health, have become resistant to antibiotics, helping them persist. Over many generations, such changes can lead to new features — or even completely new types of living beings. So, reproduction not only keeps each kind continuing, but also helps life adapt change, and continue in new forms (Fig. 13.10). But how can the same process lead both to similarity (an animal gives birth to similar individual, such as a cow gives birth to a cow) and variation (shows different characteristics like difference in color and height of to individuals of some kind)? That is a fascinating puzzle. There are two types of reproductive processes — one in which the young are almost exactly like their parent and another in which they look slightly different from their parents. In asexual reproduction, a single parent produces new individuals that are exact copies of itself (exact in terms of the instructions inside the cell). In sexual reproduction, instructions from two parents combine to create offspring that are not exactly like either of the parent. They share some traits with both parents, but also have differences. This mixing helps keep useful features while allowing new ones to appear. Over many generations, these small differences can add up — leading to big differences, and even new life forms. Let’s explore how reproduction takes place in plants and animals, and how it helps living beings develop special features and sometimes change over time. 13.5.1 Asexual reproduction Many plants can reproduces when any part of the plants — leaf, stem, or root — is planted in soil. This kind of reproduction is called vegetative propagation. Fig. 13.10: Development of calf to cow"}

Scientists study this organism to understand regeneration in animals.

This is easy to observe in animals, but did you know even flowering plants have male and female parts? Some microorganisms like bacteria and yeast also have two ‘mating types’ that act like the two parents. Special cells for reproduction You might wonder if both parents pass on their genetic material for making a new organism, won’t the child end up with double the amount of instructions? And would not this keep doubling every generation? This does not happen because each parent makes specialised reproductive cells, called gametes. These carry only half of the parent’s genetic material . When male and female gametes join, they form a new cell with a complete set of instructions — half from each parent. How do bamboo and sugarcane grow into new plants? I have never seen their seeds. Fig. 13.11: Vegetative propagation — (a) Ginger; (b) Potato (b) (a)"}

Even brothers and sisters in the same family can look different from each other. This is because every baby gets a mix of genetic information from both parents through gametes. Each gamete carries a different set of instructions for things like eye colour, hair type, and more. These instructions mix in different ways when the sperm and eggs joins to form a baby. These instructions mix in different ways each time, so each child is unique. No wonder one child may ‘inherit’ a nose similar to mother and another may inherit eyes similar to father. It all depends on which pieces of the parent’s ‘instruction book set’ came together. Sexual reproduction in plants Plants use different parts of their flowers to produce male and female gametes. Pollen grains found inside the anther of a flower are the male gametes, while ovules, found deep inside the flower, are the female gametes. Pollen is carried to another flower by wind, insects, or animals — this process is called pollination. When the male and female gametes combine, it is called fertilisation, forming a zygote that becomes the seed. The fleshy part of the flower around the ovule develops into a fruit (Fig. 13.13). When birds or animals eat the fruit, the seeds often get dropped far from the original plant — a helpful way for plants to spread. That’s how a banyan seed, dropped by a bird that ate a fruit and excreted the seed, might sprout in a crack in a wall after the rains. When seeds get water, they use stored nutrients to grow roots and shoots. Remember in Grade 6 you had studied the germination of seeds where you observed tiny shoots and the first leaves appear. Sexual reproduction in animals In animals, gametes are called sperm (male) and eggs (female). Fertilisation may take place in water, for example, male and female fish or frogs eject sperm and eggs, respectively, into the water where they combine to form the zygote. In these animals, the development of the zygote into an embryo also takes place in water (Fig. 13.14). In birds and mammals, including humans, sperm are deposited inside the female and fertilisation takes place when the sperm swim towards the egg produced by the female. After this step, birds and mammals follow different processes. Zygote Fertilisation Egg cell Sperm cell Fig. 13.14: Formation of zygote Ovule Anther Fig. 13.13: A flower"}

The development of the zygote into an embryo happens after the egg is laid during the hatching process. Think about how much ‘food’ the female parent has to put into each egg — it has to last for the developing embryo until it hatches. This is one strategy to ensures supply of nutrition to the embryo. In most mammals, the development of the zygote into an embryo takes place inside the body of the female. The mother’s body provides all the food and oxygen the baby needs to grow until it is born. This is a different way of giving nutrition to the developing baby, compared to animals like birds that lay eggs. What are the advantages and disadvantages of giving birth to young ones vs. laying eggs? Do you think animals like dogs, cows, or humans could lay eggs like birds? Why or why not? 13.6 What Are the Threats to Life on Earth? We know that life on Earth depends on a delicate balance of living and non-living things working together. But human actions are disturbing this balance. Even small changes in global temperature, oxygen levels, or the ozone layer can put life at risk. Today, the biggest environmental challenges that we face are climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution — together known as the triple planetary crisis. Burning fossil fuels like coal and oil releases greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane. These trap even more heat in the atmosphere which causes global warming. Normally, Earth keeps a balance since trees, plants, and even tiny ocean planktons absorb carbon dioxide as they grow. But when we burn fossil fuels, we release extra carbon that has been locked underground for millions of years. The Earth cannot absorb this fast enough, so the heat builds up. Even a small increase in temperature can melt ice caps, raise sea levels which could flood many coastal cities, cause extreme weather conditions, and lead to many plants and animals disappearing. These long-term changes in temperature, rainfall, and weather patterns are called climate change. When natural habitats are destroyed, plants and animals may disappear, upsetting ecosystems. For example, as we saw in Chapter 12, if grasses vanish, animals that feed on them like deer or grasshoppers struggle to survive. And without herbivores, predators like tigers or foxes lose their food too. Every type of living thing has a role, and losing even a few weakens nature’s ability to support life."}
{"class": "class 8", "subject": "science", "page_no": 244, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "224 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 Pollution adds to the problem. Air pollution from factories, vehicles, and burning fuels harms both people and the nature. It can cause breathing problems, damage crops, and lead to smog and acid rain (Fig. 13.15). Climate change affects everything—from crop growth and water supply to wildlife habitats and human health. To protect life on Earth, we need to cut pollution, use cleaner energy, and make wiser choices. We have also learnt that life on Earth flourishes within a delicate balance supported by interdependent natural systems. However, this balance is increasingly threatened by human actions. For example, a little less or more of oxygen in air, or a little lower or higher temperature of the Earth, or a little less of ozone in the atmosphere, could endanger life on the Earth. Countries around the world have made global agreements to protect the environment. The Montreal Protocol (1987) helped reduce harmful chemicals like Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), allowing the ozone layer to slowly recover. The Earth Summit (1992) led to international efforts on climate change and biodiversity. Later, the Kyoto Protocol (2005) and Paris Agreement (2015) committed countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Paris Agreement set a goal to limit global warming to below 1.5 °C, but as of 2025, the world is not on track to meet that goal. Much more action is needed to avoid any more adverse effects of climate change. Ever heard of ... Water and soil pollution are serious threats to life (Fig. 13.16). Factory, farm and plastic waste harm aquatic life and make water unsafe. Excess fertilisers and poor waste disposal pollute soil, reduce crop yield, and spread harmful substances through the food chain. Protecting them requires better waste management and sustainable farming practices. We have seen above that all the Earth system, such as hydrosphere, biosphere, atmosphere and geosphere are connected — so damage to one can affect the others. Protecting the climate means cutting down on greenhouse gases by using renewable energy like solar and wind, improving energy use, and choosing environmentally friendly ways to travel.

What is one major reason Mars cannot currently support life like Earth? (i) It has too many volcanoes. (ii) It is too close to the Sun. (iii) It lacks a thick atmosphere and liquid water. (iv) Its magnetic field is too strong. 2. Which of these is an example of geodiversity? (i) Variety of bird chirping in a forest. (ii) Different landforms like mountains, valleys, and deserts. (iii) Changing weather during monsoons. (iv) Number of different types of fish in a pond. 3. If the Earth were smaller with the same density, what might happen to its atmosphere? (i) It would become thicker and hotter. (ii) It would escape into space due to weaker gravity. (iii) It would become frozen. (iv) It would cause stronger winds. 4. In sexual reproduction, why are offspring different from their parents? (i) They grow in different climates. (ii) They eat different food. (iii) They acquire new instructions after birth. (iv) They get mixed instructions (genes) from both parents. 5. You notice tiny green plants growing in cracks on your school wall after the monsoon. Where do you think the seeds came from? What conditions helped these plants grow there? 6. A city has recently cut down a large patch of forest to build new roads and buildings. Discuss the possible effects this could have on the local climate and biodiversity? How might this affect water availability or quality in the area? 7. A friend says, “The Earth has always had climate changes in the past, so today’s global warming is nothing new.” How would you respond using what you’ve learnt in this and other chapters of your science book? Why? When? How long? Where? Why not?

Imagine Earth’s magnetic field suddenly disappeared. What kinds of problems could arise for life on Earth? Explain. 9. You are tasked with designing a new settlement for humans on Mars. Name three things you would need to recreate from Earth to support human life there. Which of these do you think is the hardest to replicate, and why? 10. In a village, the temperature has been increasing and rainfall has become unpredictable over the past few years. What could be causing this change? Suggest two ways the village could adapt to these new conditions. 11. If there were no atmosphere on the Earth, would it affect life, temperature, and water on the planet? Explain. 12. Discuss five examples of vegetative propagation. Discover, design, and debate Society Science Inter- disciplinary Projects z Design an ‘Earth Survival Kit’. Imagine you’re building a tiny model of Earth for another planet. What must it have to support life, and why? z India is planning for a challenging lunar mission, Chandrayaan-4, which will bring back samples of soil from the Moon. If the Moon had water, could plants grow in that soil? Think of some experiment that could help you explore whether plant growth is possible on the Moon. z Flowers are often brightly coloured and have a pleasant smell. How do you think these features help the plant reproduce? z Why do animals like fish and frogs lay hundreds or even thousands of eggs at a time, while other animals lay only a few? What might be the advantages and disadvantages of laying so many eggs? z Birds like sparrows build nests and care for their eggs and chicks, while reptiles like snakes usually lay their eggs and leave them without protection.

And we have arrived at the final page of our Grade 8 science journey. But remember, this is not the end of your exploration. Throughtout the year, we hope you have learnt to ask deeper questions, design investigations, and think like real scientists do. Whether you wondered about how forces work, explored the remarkable balance of our planet, or investigated how ecosystems are connected, you’ve already entered the Investigative World of Science. If you noticed, we left space in every chapter for you to ask your own questions. What are the things around you that puzzled you? Perhaps you noticed how water droplets on a leaf act like a lens, or wondered why different birds have different flight patterns. Things that you notice, and the questions you ask about them are the very beginning of scientific investigation. This textbook has been designed to guide you — rooted in real observations, yet lifting your imagination to fly as high as a kite. But the real adventure belongs to you: keep asking, keep experimenting, keep sharing your findings with your friends and teachers. As you close this book, remember that next year, you will enter the secondary stage, where we will go deeper into the world of science. The story will continue with more detailed investigations, bigger challenges, and greater discoveries. So never stop wondering, never stop experimenting, and never stop believing that your curiosity can change the world. We’ll meet you again on those pages — because in science, it is never the end, my friend!"}
