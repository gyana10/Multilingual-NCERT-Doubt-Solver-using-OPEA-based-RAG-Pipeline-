Their health is very important as they constitute a large percentage of our population. Many factors like physical, psychological, socio-economic and cultural influence our health, both in our day-to-day life and in the long run. The involvement of all children in physical activities, games and sport, and yoga along with authentic knowledge is essential for their physical, emotional, social and mental development. In this endeavour, school education plays an important role. All the National Curriculum Frameworks have recommended health and physical education as an integral part of the school curriculum. With this view, the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has prepared this textbook on Health and Physical Education for Class X. This textbook focuses on the holistic understanding of physical education and its relationship with other subjects and the effects of physical activities on human body. It also provides a scope for children to learn the theoretical, as well as, the practical aspects of individual and team games. Further, it discusses yoga, dietary considerations, safety measures for healthy living, social health, agencies and awards promoting health, sports and yoga. The information about coronavirus (COVID-19), its modes of transmision and prevention have also been included at relevant places to help the children remain safe and healthy. Keeping in view the inter-related nature of the concepts covered in the area of Health and Physical Education, the presentation is made in a cohesive and an integrated manner rather than adopting a fragmentary approach. Experiential learning activities for acquiring skills for healthy living are made an integral part of the book. The NCERT appreciates the efforts of the Textbook Development Committee. Several experts and teachers have contributed towards the finalisation of this book. We are grateful to them and their institutions. I am thankful to Professor Saroj Yadav, Dean (Academic) and the Project Coordinator of the National Population Education Project (NPEP) for her continuous efforts in developing this material and bringing it to its present from. As an organisation committed to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality of our products, the NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions from teachers and students, which will enable us to undertake further revision and refinement.

In other words, it aims at optimum physical, mental and social development of an individual. What is Physical Education? According to Webster’s Dictionary, “Physical education is a part of education which gives instructions in the development and care of the body rending from simple callisthenic exercises to a course of study providing training in hygiene, gymnastics, and the performance and management of athletics and games.” Central Advisory Board of Physical Education and Recreation defines PE as “an education through physical activities for the development of total personality of the child to its fullness and perfection in body, mind and spirit. Physical education is an area through which sports, outdoor activities like trekking, hiking, camping, gymnastics, dance, aquatics are used to train individuals in motor skills and fitness skills. Physical education also assists the schools in carrying out responsibility of developing personal and social skills in students.” In fact, PE is an integral part of total education. It makes significant contribution towards the achievement of desirable educational and health outcomes. It also enables children to acquire necessary knowledge and skills to stimulate them to actively participate in physical activities throughout their lifespan. Need and Importance of Physical Education Participation in games, sports and yoga provide thrill and enjoyment to everyone. In addition, it helps to entertain and maintain a healthy lifestyle.

Academic achievement By participating in various physical and yogic activities, students get stimulated to face challenges and are encouraged to think productively. This tends to improve their concentration of academic achievement. Develops skills and experiences Various activities learned during school days such as gymnastics, running, jumping, throwing, swimming, playing team games, learning the rules and regulations of the games and being disciplined help students to develop sportspersonship. Positive self-image Participation in regular physical activities also helps students to understand the need for appreciation of own positive aspects and develop ability to compete and cooperate with others. Self belief is also reinforced. Improves interpersonal relationships When you play with other students and teams, you learn to develop interpersonal relationships with members of your own team as well as with members of other teams. It builds interactive and positive social environment. Develops internal organ systems By participating in physical and yogic activities, students respond to the increased demands of daily life in a healthy way. The system of the body responds to stimuli and becomes more efficient at coping with the load exerted on it. Objectives of Physical Education Broadly, there are four objectives of Physical Education which are as follows. Physical fitness It refers to the state where an individual is physically fit and has developed great endurance, speed and strength. Physical fitness is essential for leading a happy, healthy, vigorous and fulfilling life. Physical and motor fitness helps to learn and develop technical and tactical knowledge of sports and games. Activity 1.1 • • Measure your pulse and respiration rates before and after playing different games or participation in a sport event. •• Collect information from 10 persons and prepare a project on physical activities and eating habits and their impact on the human body.

Physical education activities provide ample opportunities to develop such traits and life skills as cooperation, respect for others, loyalty, sportspersonship, self-confidence, etc. All these qualities help a person to become more social and a responsible citizen. Sports culture It aims at developing an understanding and appreciation of one’s own local environment as well as the global environment. By participating in various physical activities, such as, dance, sports, games and yoga, a person fully understands the history, culture, traditions, etc., and also the aesthetic values associated with these activities. Mental efficiency In physical education, a child has to participate in a number of physical and yogic activities. These activities not only require involvement of the body but also require use of the intellect to carry out the task. Positive, healthy and active body-mind relationship helps to enhance mental efficiency. Scope of Physical Education Physical education has evolved as a multi-disciplinary subject and its scope is not just confined to physical fitness and the rules of games and sports. The meaning and definition of Physical Education, its aims and objectives and scope, and factors affecting physical fitness and wellness, rules and other necessary knowledge about health, games and sports and yoga are major areas of study in physical education. Games and sports, as well as, cultural heritage, development of leadership qualities and group dynamics through sports and games are also an integral part of this discipline. In fact, physical education now includes several areas which belong to other subjects like Biology, Genetics, Psychology, Physics, Bio Chemistry, Sociology, Anthropology, History, Culture, Medicine, Media studies, etc. Contents from other disciplines like laws of motion, types of lever, force, equilibrium and centre of gravity, common postural deviations, therapeutic modalities in rehabilitation, sports massage, prevention and first aid for common sport- injuries, are also the content of physical education. Biological foundations such as heredity and environment, growth and development are also included in it. Content drawn from psychology, such as, importance of psychology in education with special reference to physical education, such as, individual differences and personality, learning and motivation are related to Physical Education.

What is Coronavirus? Covid 19 is the infectious disease caused by the recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. That is why it is called the Novel (new) Coronavirus (NCoV). 2. What are the symptoms? The most common symptoms of Coronavirus are fever, cough and difficulty in breathing. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and dont’t feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. People with fever cough and difficulty in breathing should seek medical attention immediately. 3. How does Coronavirus spread? People can catch Coronavirus from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with Coronavirus coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch Coronavirus by first touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch Coronavirus if they breathe in from a person with Coronavirus who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter away from a person who is sick. 4. How to prevent Coronavirus? Wash your hands with soap water regularly. Throw used tissues into closed bins immediately after use. If soap and water is not available, use hand sanitiser with at least 60 per cent alcohol. Cover your nose and mouth with handkerchief/tissue while sneezing and coughing. Wash hands before touching eyes, nose and mouth. Avoid mass gathering and crowded places.

These are principles and characteristics of sports training, methods of sports training, training load, warming up, cooling down, aerobic and anaerobic activities, calisthenics and rhythmic exercises, specific training program for development of various motor qualities, techniques, tactics and talent identification. It is also important to understand the difference between play, games and sports. Play, Games and Sport Though these terms are used interchangeably, these are actually different. Play Play is spontaneous. It is usually a creative activity but has its own limitation and space. One plays voluntarily for fun and pleasure. Play, however, is a broad area which includes both games and sports. The distinctive features of play are that they are free, separate, uncertain, governed by self rules and creative. Games Generally the word games and sports are used together. A game is an activity involving more players, defined by a goal that the players tries to reach, and some set rules to play. By masses, games are played primarily for entertainment or enjoyment. The difference of purpose differentiates sport from game, combined with the notion of individual or team skill. Games are also played on the basis of a set of rules. A game is defined as a goal that the players try to achieve. A person who participates in a game is known as a player. Sport A sport is a physical activity carried out under an agreed set of rules, for competition or self-enjoyment or a combination of these. Sport are the kind of activities in which similar kind of body movement is repeated over a long time. For example, swimming and running and almost all the track and field events come under sport. Sport involves an activity or activities where the mental capabilities of the sportsperson are judged. In a sport, it is the sportsperson or the individual who determines the outcome. A person participating in a sport is called an athlete or a sportsperson. Activity 1.3 The teacher divides students into small groups of 10 and plans an aerobic dance or drama.

These ideas might then be used by students in various other fields of learning, such as, arts, science, civics and citizenship, communication, design, creativity and technology and languages (english, hindi and other regional languages), humanities (e.g. history, geography, economics, etc.), information and communication technology and psychology. Art Health and physical education teachers can incorporate activities related to performing arts, drawing, painting, dance, drama, media, music and visual communication into their programs. These involve both fine motor skills and whole body movement including rhythmic movement. As body movements are part of both arts practice and health and physical education, these promote health knowledge, understanding of the body and lead to physical fitness and enhancing of creative skills at the same time. Science The human body is a common concern of both science and health and physical education. In science, students study the human body from the cellular level to the systems level, with a focus on anatomy and physiology. In health and physical education learning is focused on the requirements for good health and the promotion of a healthy body. Students gain an understanding of the role of physical and yogic activities in ensuring good health and can link the functioning of the musculo-skeletal, digestive, endocrine and nervous systems studied in science, for the promotion of the physical, social, mental and emotional health of individuals within a society. Students consider it their personal responsibilities to discuss and adopt health issues, both in relation to their own safety and well-being, as well as to the safety and well-being of others. It also contributes in the designing of training for movements of organs to achieve optimal performance in the area of play, sports and games.

Key concepts within health and physical education classes include understanding of the importance of personal identity within a community, what makes a community and how to engage with different members and agencies within a community. Participation in physical activity and sports also reflect values, rules, rights and responsibilities indicative of a democratic society. Communication Communication involves developing knowledge, skills and behaviors that empower students to respond to, make meaning of, and deconstruct a range of communication forms. Effective communication is a key skill in health and physical education. It is essential that students develop the ability to listen, view and respond with respect to the content and context in which communication happens. Learning in the health and physical education domain involves developing familiarity with forms, language and conventions used in different forms of public, personal and interpersonal communication. Design, Creativity and Technology Design, Creativity and Technology (DCT) help in developing sport goods, sportwear, sport software programme, etc. These are associated with knowledge and promotion. In this area students learn about the characteristic and properties of how all these aspects differ from each other. These investigations assist students to make decisions about appropriate solution. Students analyse and evaluate factors, such as, social, cultural and economic factors that influence design, creativity and technology. Language(s) Languages help students to develop critical approaches to the ideas and thoughts collated to read, view, write, compare, research and talk about texts. Health and Physical Education teachers can use examples related to health and wellbeing to encourage students to reflect on their lifestyles and analyse ways by which the media influences their attitude towards health. For example, Health and Physical Education emphasises on the importance of physical fitness, self-esteem and body image in the maintenance of good health. Economics Economics is the study of how society allocates scarce resources to satisfy the wants and needs of its members. Within the health and physical education (HPE) context, consumer health assists students to become more informed consumers of health products and services.

The text of these martial arts is discussed in the local languages. For folk dances the accompanying songs are in regional languages and music has its own characteristic tone and rhythm. The concepts of movement, dance, physical activity and sport, vary culturally. These are associated with their own specific languages, vocabularies and discourses. Different societies have different attitudes, values and beliefs about physical activities which are expressed in their regional languages. Myths and Misconceptions about Physical Education Myths are surrounded in regard to relationship of physical education with academic success. One of the most discussed myths in the society is that participation in sport and games reduces academic performance of individual. Myths Participation in sport kills the time of study. Contrary to the widely held assumption that sport and other activities cut upon the time for serious school study, research evidence has shown that students tend to do better in school when they participate in physical activities. There is a positive correlation between performance in sport and the level of academic achievement. Physical education including sport is an integral part of the social and cultural infrastructure of a nation. It really can make a difference in the broader educational process and in changing and enhancing the quality of life. Vigorous physical exercise stimulates circulation, helps prevent skin eruptions and increases fluid intake. These exercises also promote self-worth and mental health, and support an individual for healing an injury. Sport also enhances physical performance and induce positive physiological adaptation. When children exercise, their fitness needs are met, and build up energy to learn and achieve. Given the growing number of children with obesity, watching TV, continuously being involved in computer games and other unwanted activities, frequency of the children getting involved in physical achievement and academic performance, has taken a back seat. Physical exercise enhances the function in joints, increases the sense of physical well being and promotes a sense of feeling good. It also increases physical working capacity by increasing cardio- respiratory fitness and increased strength and endurance and decreases risk of serious disease that could lead to early disability and death.

You are aware that a healthy individual is one who has a healthy mind in a healthy body. This state of health can be achieved when various organ systems of the body function in harmony. For example, physical activities are based on motor movements and their co-ordination. The command for movements comes from the brain which is a part of the nervous system. The required energy for movements and other activities is obtained from food. Food is completely digested in the intestine, a part of digestive system. Food and oxygen reach all the parts of body through the action of heart, which is a part of the circulatory system. In fact, many organ systems of the body function as an integrated whole for healthy maintenance of the body. You have already studied about organ systems of the human body in the previous science classes. In this chapter, the organ systems have been discussed in relation to the effect of physical activities. It is a common experience that performance in any event, sports or otherwise, depends upon physical health, as well as, mental and emotional health. Development and maintenance of physical, mental and emotional health specially during this coronavirus (COVID-19) is therefore, very important. Organ Systems of Human Body Aggregates of cells constitute a tissue. Tissues of various kinds together make an organ and many organs together comprise an organ system.

Before we learn about the impact of physical activities on organ systems, let us review functioning of these systems. Organ systems for movement of body and limbs: skeletal and muscular systems When you walk, play, exercise, practice or participate in a sport, or even when you ‘warm up’ prior to a sport activity or competition, what is most obvious are the movements of hands and legs, with the brain being equally active. All the movements are due to contraction of muscles. Muscles are attached to bones. Bones form the skeleton. Bones are attached to each other by ligaments and muscles are attached to bones by tendons (Fig. 2.1, 2.2, 2.3).

You have learnt in earlier classes that there are mainly three kinds of muscles. There are muscles that contract to cause movements according to one’s will. These are called voluntary muscles, such as, those of the limbs and the neck. The involuntary muscles, such as, those lining the food canal, move automatically without our efforts for making them move. Another kind of muscles, which are also involuntary, are the muscles of the heart or cardiac muscles which never stop contracting and relaxing. As learnt in earlier classes, muscle cells (muscle fibres) may be striated (voluntary) muscle fibres, unstriated (involuntary) muscle fibres and cardiac muscle fibres (Fig.2.4). Muscles are grouped into bundles enclosed in a membrane. Movement of muscles takes place by the movement of molecules of muscle proteins, called actin and myosin present in the muscle fibres. Upon receiving instructions from the brain and nerves, these proteins slide over each other and the muscle contracts. Muscle contraction uses up energy, which comes from food. It is measured in calories. Energy producing organ systems Through digestive system, food gets digested and converted to a form, which can be broken down in the cell to release energy. Respiratory system ensures a continuous supply of Oxygen to each and every cell of the body for oxidation of food. It is also responsible for continuous elimination of carbon dioxide produced as a result of this oxidation. Digested food (Glucose) + Oxygen → Carbon dioxide + Water + ATP Adenosine Tri Phosphate (ATP) is the chemical that releases energy. ATP is biological energy. Respiratory system functions to ensure the continuous supply of oxygen to the body and removal of carbon dioxide from the body. Fig. 2.5 shows the different parts of the respiratory system. The intake of oxygen laden air from the atmosphere into lungs is inspiration (inhalation) and the process of removal of CO2 laden air from lungs is expiration (exhalation). Inspiration and expiration constitute breathing. (Fig. 2.7) Activity 2.1 Underline the labelled vital organs in Fig. 2.5 Observe the location of the vital organs such as the spinal cord.

The reverse happens during exhalation when muscles of the rib cage and diaphragm relax and CO2 laden air from lungs goes out through bronchi, trachea and nostrils. Breathing is followed by internal respiration when oxygen laden air from alveoli or air sacks of lungs is picked up by capillaries and reaches the heart through pulmonary vein. Once oxygen reaches cells, it oxidises glucose (which reaches cells after digestion through blood) to release energy as ATP or adenosine tri phosphate.

It also transports hormones and minerals required for the body. The flow chart below shows organs of circulatory system for you to recall. Organs of the circulatory system Heart Blood Vessels Arteries Veins Capillaries Heart (Fig. 2.8) is the most vital organ of the body. It is situated between the two lungs in the thoracic cavity and is a cone shaped muscular, four chambered organ covered by a membrane. The four chambers are left and right atria (singular atrium) and left and right ventricles. They are separated by muscular partitions called septa singular septum. The chambers communicate by openings which are protected by valves. The cardiac muscle cells continuously contract and relax (heart beat) for pumping blood into the organs and receiving blood from them. As the heart beats, oxygenated blood flows into the arteries and goes to various parts of the body, and then it flows back to the heart through veins for oxygenation in the lungs. This circulation of blood is depicted below. Blood flow between heart and lungs is called pulmonary circulation, while between heart and body parts is called systemic circulation.

Strong muscles also give stability and improve balance and coordination during movements. Physical activities also improve blood supply to the muscles and increase their capacity to use oxygen. Muscles and muscle performance Physical activities if undertaken regularly have beneficial effects on the muscular system. Whenever physical activities, games or sport are undertaken there is contraction of muscles and increase in energy level due to breakdown of ATP. The beneficial effects of regular physical activities are listed below — •• Change in shape and size of the muscle fibres: Muscle fibres enlarge with physical activities which cause an overall enlargement of muscles with the change in its size and shape. The size of muscles increases by 60 per cent. It is because of this reason that, the muscles of arms of a tennis player are well developed. •• Maintenance of muscle tone: Muscles are stimulated to contract by signals from nerves. Due to continuous signals, when physical exercises are undertaken, muscles remain in partial state of contraction called muscle tone. Hence, regular physical activities maintain good muscle tone and enhance physical fitness. •• Increase in muscle proteins: The units of muscle contraction are proteins. Physical activities lead to increase in total proteins. •• Increase in blood capillaries: Regular physical exercises lead to increase in number of blood capillaries supplying blood to muscles. •• Increase in efficiency of ligaments and tendons: Ligaments and tendons become more efficient as a result of regular physical activity. This improves muscle movements resulting in greater tolerance of stress during strenuous activity. •• Long term increase in muscle strength: Regular physical exercises increase and maintain strength of muscles. This increases speed of contraction as in the case of marathon runner and also work well against load as in the case of weight lifter. •• Delay in muscle fatigue: Muscles need oxygen to contract. But when muscles are used for a long time during sport, available oxygen gets used up and lactic acid accumulates. This causes muscle fatigue. It is, therefore, important to do physical activities like stretching to delay muscle fatigue. Reprint 2025-26"}

Healthy muscles give the body a beautiful shape. Oxygen Debt During physical activities, respiratory rate increases. At the same time, oxygen gets speedily used up, this creates an oxygen debt, as the rate of oxygen intake may not match the oxygen requirement due to the exercise. Thus, maximum exercises are followed by a recovery period when oxygen debt is removed by obtaining more oxygen. For example, when an athlete is running and requires 3 litres of oxygen, if oxygen obtained is only 2 litres, oxygen debt of 1 litre is created, which gets recovered during recovery period. •• Overall improvement in efficiency of muscle movements and reaction time: Muscles contract on receiving stimulus from nerves. The time taken to react to the stimuli (reaction time) improves with regular physical exercise. •• Increase in capacity for storage of food: Regular physical activities help cells to store more food, which can be readily available for oxidation to provide energy when needed. Respiratory system •• Increase in size of lungs and volume of chest: Physical activities require more oxygen. Therefore, more oxygen has to be inhaled. This provides exercise to the lungs and chest and as a result the size increases. Simultaneously, the diaphragm and rib muscles strengthen. •• Increase in lung power: Respiratory exercises, which include Pranayam and Anulom-vilom, improve lung power. The efficiency of alveoli or air sacs of lungs also improves. •• Activation of unused (inactive) alveoli: Active inhalation increases residual volume of air, tidal air and vital capacity which is important for healthy body. Residual volume of air: Even after forced expiration some air remains in the lung, it cannot be expelled and is called residual air. Vital capacity: Vital capacity is the amount of air inhaled and exhaled with maximum effort. In normal adult, it is 3500 cc to 4500 cc. Vital Capacity = TV + IRV + ERV (TV= Tidal Volume, IRV =Inspiratory Reserve Volume, ERV=Expiratory Reserve Volume) TV: The volume of air breathed in and out during quiet breathing is called tidal volume.

Circulatory system Blood pumped into circulation transports oxygen and food to tissues, removes waste and also transports hormones to target organs. During physical activities, nutrients and Oxygen is needed by muscles to get energy for contraction. So heart pumps at a faster rate and circulation is speeded up. But this change is temporary. Certain permanent changes also occur when physical activities are undertaken regularly. These are given below. •• Increase in the size of heart occurs as cardiac muscles develop with regular physical activities. Regular exercise increases the capacity and thickness of the walls of the heart. •• Increase in number of capillaries and blood cells: The unused capillaries become active with physical activities making circulation efficient. An increase in the number of blood cells and amount of hemoglobin has also been observed. •• Decrease in heart rate: Under normal conditions the heart beats 72 times per minute at rest. But an athlete’s heart rate may be found to be much lower at rest. The athlete’s heart becomes so efficient that at rest same requirement is fulfilled with fewer heartbeats. •• Increase in stroke volume: Stroke volume is the quantity of blood pumped out by aorta in one stroke. Heart, having gained efficiency with regular physical activities, is able to pump out more blood in one stroke.

Note: Adolescence is a crucial period in the life cycle of human beings. Understanding Adolescence The period of adolescence begins with the onset of puberty, during which certain hormones gets activated. It is an increase in secretion of sex hormones (testosterone in males, estrogen and progesterone in females). Puberty merges into adolescence at around 10 years of age, and adolescence generally lasts till 19 years of age. You may recall the discussion on adolescence in the chapters of your Class VIII textbook of science and the Class IX textbook of Health and Physical Education. During this phase, significant physical and psychological changes take place. However, as you have already learnt in your previous classes, the timing of these changes varies with every individual. Unique features of adolescence The two unique features of adolescence are — (i) The spurt in physical growth, when a physical appearance of an individual gradually becomes different. This is due to the rapid acceleration in growth of skeletal tissue (bones and cartilage) and muscular and glandular tissue. For examples, breasts begin to develop in girls due to the release of estrogen hormone. Changes in voice are quite noticeable among boys. (ii) It is a time period between the onset of puberty and adulthood. Growth spurt in adolescents As you would have experienced yourself, the changes during adolescence occur speedily and alter the body size and shape of adolescents. Suddenly the child seems to have grown up into a young adult. This is called growth spurt and is shown through the following flow chart. Reprint 2025-26"}

Sex hormones stimulate growth and maturity of gonads (reproductive organs). In males, testes grow in size and start producing sperms. In females, the eggs or ova present in the ovary since birth begins to mature. Sex organs also increase in size. Thus, there is an overall growth in body size. As sexual maturity progresses during adolescence, hormones act on growth centers of bones which are responsible for increase in length of bones. The long bones, the vertebrae and limbs grow and the adolescent gains height. The limbs become stronger. The heart, lungs and other internal organs also grow to match the increase in body size. The muscle mass undergoes a spurt at adolescence. Eventually, growth rate slows down and then stops. Generally, at the age of 14 to 18 years of age, adult height is already reached. The peak of growth of muscle mass is also typically around the age of 14 to 16 years. In the females, the pelvis region undergoes a growth spurt and becomes wider. Secondary Sexual Characteristics In earlier classes, you have learnt about secondary sexual characteristics. As a result of physical changes, secondary sexual characteristics begin to develop in both girls and boys. Some characteristics are related to girls; some to boys and some are common for both.

In India, age of menarche is 12-13 years but may vary from individual to individual. Menstruation generally stops between the age of 45 and 55 years and is termed as menopause. Menopausal age varies in different individuals. Age of menarche has decreased due to various lifestyle changes. Menstruation hygiene and cleanliness is very important. Points to remember — •• Regular bath and washing self properly are important for avoiding infections, especially during menstruation. •• Change undergarment regularly (at least once a day) and avoid synthetic cloth. •• During menstruation, cloth, cloth pads or napkins should be changed after every four to six hours to avoid infection. •• One can also use sanitary napkins to manage menstrual hygiene. Many girls and women also make sanitary napkins at home with old cloth and cotton. If one makes a sanitary napkin at home, use only clean, soft cotton cloth. Do not use old cloth that may have any metal or plastic parts in it like glitter, gota or hooks and buttons.

Government is supporting schemes for promoting menstrual hygiene among adolescent girls (10-19 years). Sanitary napkins are made available in schools or by ASHAs at a subsidised rate. Psychosocial Changes during Adolescence Psychosocial changes mean changes in thoughts, mood, attractions and friendships. The word ‘social’ is associated with the word ‘society’. As adolescence sets in, a boy or girl becomes psychologically aware of self and society. As a result, the adolescents build their own image and personality. This gives confidence to the adolescent to move in the society. Adolescence is a transitional phase between childhood and adulthood. During this transitional period the adolescents get confused regarding their emerging role in the family and society at large. The physical changes in adolescents are accompanied by psychosocial changes. Adolescents get attracted towards opposite sex or become part of a peer group. Such changes tend to make them more dependent on the peer group in neighborhood, among classmates, etc. This often creates stressful relationships with parents, teachers and elders. Sometimes these developments may make them insecure about future. Adolescents who become aware of these changes, overcome this phase comfortably. The social changes are reflected in the behavior of adolescents with peers and parents. They differ from parents on many issues and develop the confidence to express their own opinion emphatically if parents are friendly and understanding. Adolescents are more friendly with their peer group. However belonging to a vulnerable age group, adolescents may feel pressurised under the influence of peers. Everyone feels the need to have friends but during adolescence the need for friendship is more pronounced. The friendship may be with a peer or relative of one’s own age and someone of own sex or the other sex. It is, therefore, important for them to identify with whom they can share their ideas and identify ‘safety net’ in friends, parents and teachers.

While you must maintain hygiene of all external parts, the internal organs also have to function normally. You know that certain vital functions of the body for enjoying good health are maintenance of blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, etc. Some ways of assessing the vital functions and statistics of human beings are given below. Blood pressure (BP) and its measurement Pressure exerted by blood on the wall of the arteries is called blood pressure. When the heart contracts, blood surges through aorta, BP is highest (Systolic Pressure) pressure of blood on the arterial wall recorded when ventricles relax is lowest (Diastolic Pressure). The pressure wave along the arteries with each heartbeat can be felt at the pulse. Blood pressure is measured by the instrument called “Sphygmoma- nometer”. Diastolic and Systolic pressure is measured and in a normal healthy young adult it is 110/75, which means 110 mm Hg systolic and 75 mm Hg diastolic. Sphygmomanometer consists of cuff with an inflatable bladder which is wrapped around a person’s up- per arm and a rubber bulb inflates the bladder. An attached device indicates the blood pressure. There is now a digital de- vice which is also used for measuring the BP. BP increases with age to about 130/90mm Hg. Abnormally high BP is called hypertension.

If red or thick or covered by a secretion or foreign body, it requires immediate medical attention or consultation of a eye doctor. Tongue examination Nutritional deficiencies, infections, dysfunction of nerves or even cancer can be detected by examining the tongue. Some key characteristic features of a tongue in normal condition can be noted by physical examination. These are — (i) Colour: Pink red on both upper and lower surface. On lower surface blood vessels may be seen. (ii) Texture: Rough on upper surface due to presence of papillae or taste buds. Hair, farrows or ulceration indicates dysfunction. (iii) Size: If not swollen, tongue will fit comfortably inside the mouth. The tongue can be examined by the following steps — • Make tip of tongue touch roof of mouth to inspect ventral surface. • When protruded out, colour and texture can be noted for any deviation. • Use gauze to hold protruded tongue (wearing gloves) between tongue and index figure and fill the fender areas.

History Track and field events are among the oldest of all sporting competitions. Running, jumping and throwing have been universal forms of human physical activities since the human beings exist. The first recorded example of organised track and field events is found in the Ancient Olympic Games held in 776 BC. The starting of the modern Olympic Games at Greece in 1896 was marked as new era for track and field events which was initiated by Pierre-de-Coubertin. Until the early 1920s, only males were participating in the track and field events. Introduction of five track and field events for women in the athletics was started during 1928 Summer Olympics. Gradually more women’s events were introduced as time progressed. However, it was only towards the second half of the twentieth century that the men’s and women’s track and field events were given equal status. Furthermore, major track and field events for disabled athletes were first introduced at the 1960 Summer Para Olympics. From 1990’s onwards, track and field events became increasingly more professional.

At the professional level, sprinters begin the race by assuming a crouching position on the starting blocks. Then they lean their body forward and gradually move into an upright position as the race progresses and momentum is gained. Athlete remain in the same lane on the running track throughout the sprinting distance. The man or woman who runs fastest and takes minimum time over 100m, wins the race. The winner is often named ‘the fastest man/woman in the competition’. Some sprint events start in lanes, to cover the same distance for each runner.

These races require that the athletes maintain a plateau pace, (i.e. the maintenance of speed at which the runner is running) that allows for a final spurt of speed, whereas sprint races need to be run at top speed for the entire length of the race. Long distance There are four common long distance running events in track and field. These are 3000 meters, 5000 meters and 10,000 meters and 3000 meters steeplechase. Long distance track races have much in common with middle distance races. However, in these races, pacing, endurance, and race tactics play an important role in performance. In these events, runners need to balance their energy to win the race.

Jumping events The jumping events comprise Long Jump, Triple Jump, High Jump and Pole Vault. 1. Long jump: The long jump is one of the oldest field events. The take-off has to be made from a 20 cm wide board one meter away from a pit. Athletes sprint along a length of track to a take off board and a sandpit. If any part of the runner’s foot goes past the takeoff board, the jumper is considered for a foul and does not receive score for that round. Distance is measured from the end of the takeoff board to the nearest mark made by the jumper on the pit. Best eight competitors have a maximum of six rounds. Professional long jumpers typically have strong acceleration and sprinting abilities. However, athletes must also have a consistent stride to allow them to take off near the board while still maintaining their maximum speed. Fig. 4.11: Long jump 2. Triple jump: Similar to the long jump, the triple jump takes place on a field heading towards a sandpit. This event is termed as the “hop-step and jump.” The event begins like a long jump, with competitor dashing down the runway and leaping from a takeoff board they first hop then take a step and then jump into the pit.

In between, they must clear the 4-meter-long bar without knocking it off its supports. The bar will originally be set at a low height, at which competitors may choose to jump, or pass to another height. The bar is raised to a predetermined height after each round. Each competitor who either clears or passes a height advances to the next round. They are ranked according to the height they clear. An athlete is allowed a maximum of three trials of each height. Competitors are eliminated after missing (failing) three consecutive jumps in a particular height. Athletes have a short run up and then take off from near one foot to jump over a horizontal bar and fall back onto a cushioned landing area. Jumping technique has played a significant part in the history of the event. The modern technique of high jump as shown in the figure is known as “Fosbury Flop”. Fig. 4.13: High jump 4.

As per technique, they begin clearing the bar with their feet first in a position so that the stomach faces the bar. As with high jumping, vaulters may touch the bar, as long as it doesn’t fall. Round-by-round scoring rules are the same as for the high jump. Throwing events There are four major throwing events: Shot Put (putting the shot), Discus, Javelin and Hammer Throw. These are detailed below. Fig. 4.15: Shot Put 1. Shot Put: In putting the shot event the athletes put a metal ball through the air for maximum distance. For male athletes, the metal ball weights 7.26 kg and for female athletes the weight is 4 kg. The athlete must stay in a circle of 2.135 m (7 ft) diameter until the shot has landed after throw. The put must be made from the shoulder with one arm only, and the shot must not be brought behind the shoulder. In shot put the athlete holds the shot close to their neck in one hand.

Discus: In the discus event the athlete stands inside a throwing circle of 2.5 mt (8’–2½”) diameter. As per technique he/she turns around one and a half times and throws the disc as far as he or she can. The disc is a round plate made of wood and metal and weighs 2 Kg for men and 1 Kg for women. When throwing the discus, the athlete must remain in circle. The feet of the athlete cannot leave this area before the discus lands. Even afterwards the athlete must leave the circle from rear half of the circle. Otherwise it is a fault and the throw will not be counted. The athlete will spin around to gain momentum, speed and then releases the disc in the proper direction. The athlete that throws it furthest from the front part of the circle (and within the legal area) wins the event. Fig. 4.16: Discus throw Fig. 4.17: Javelin throw 3. Javelin: The javelin is something like a spear. The official javelin size for women is 2.2 to 2.3 meters long and weights 600 grams.

The athlete has to hold the javelin by its grip, throw the javelin overhand and cannot turn the back to the target when throwing. When throwing the javelin, the athlete runs down a runway to gain momentum and then must throw the javelin prior to crossing a line. The athlete cannot go over the line until the javelin lands. To avoid foul, the athlete must have a really good balance at the end of the throw. The athlete must leave the runway from behind the extended lines of the throwing arc. Fig. 4.18: Hammer throw 4. Hammer Throw: The hammer throw doesn’t actually involve throwing a hammer like you would think. In this throwing event the athletes throw a heavy ball (7.265 Kg for men and 4 Kg for women) that is attached to a handle with a long (4 feet) wire. Like the discus and the shot put, the athlete must stay in a circle until the hammer lands. They spin several times to gain momentum prior to releasing the hammer. Balance is important due to the force generated by having the heavy ball at the end of the long wire. Rules for field events In general, most field events allow an athlete to take their attempt individually, under the same conditions as the other athletes. Each attempt is measured to determine who achieved the longest distance or maximum height. •• Horizontal jumps (long jump and triple jump) must be initiated from behind a line. In the case of throws, that line is an arc or inside a circle. Crossing the line while initiating the attempt will invalidate the attempt. It will be considered as a foul. Reprint 2025-26"}

However there are other individual sports like Badminton, Gymnastics, Table Tennis, Tennis, Swimming and Combative Sports such as Judo and Boxing. We shall discuss these games in this chapter. Badminton Badminton is a racket sport played by either two opposing players (singles) or two opposing pairs (doubles). The players take positions on opposite halves of a rectangular court that is divided by a net. It is one of the few sports where men and women can play together. It is a game for all ages and abilities. Although fitness is a key aspect for professional players, it is also played as a recreation game across the world. History The origin of the badminton dates back to second century BC. Although it appears that this sport was named after Badminton House, Gloucestershire, owned by the Duke of Beaufort. In 1873, some British army officers in India initially played the game at ‘Poonah’ (now known as Pune) thus derived its name. In 1877 first set of rules were derived. These laws were gradually adopted by other nations. However, the game evolved as an international sport only after the first All England Championship. In 1934, the International Badminton Federation (now known as Badminton World Federation) was formed and the rules of the game were standardized. Badminton Association of India came into existence in the year 1934. Various state level associations are affiliated to it. Individual Games and Sports II 5 Reprint 2025-26"}

Fundamental techniques 1. Grip: Holding grip of a badminton racket is the foundation of playing this game. Holding the racket wrongly will reduce the power and accuracy of the stroke. The shots will be limited. A player needs to learn how to change grip quickly during games. Below are the two basic types of badminton grips. Forehand grip •• This grip is used to hit shots on the forehand side of the body and around the head shots. •• In this a player holds the racket head in the non-playing hand, keeping the handle points towards the body. The face of the racket perpendicular to the floor. •• The player places the playing hand on the handle just like shaking hands with it, it is like a V shape in between thumb and index finger. •• For flexibility, the racket handle rest loosely in the fingers. •• In order to increase control and accuracy while serving and hitting from the forecourt and mid court, the grip is shortened and placed nearer to the shaft.

Angle 1 Angle 3 Angle 2 Fig. 5.3: Backhand grip 2. Service: There are basically three types of serves — high, low and flat. High service is the most basic of all strokes. One needs to learn this first when one starts playing the game. You need to concentrate on the following three broad points while delivering the high service. •• Stance: To deliver the high service, the player has to take a position about two feet from the short service line and about six inches from the centre line. The player has to make sure not to touch the centre line as it will be called a touch fault. The player has to stand comfortably with both feet spread apart and parallel to each other and take the initial serving position. At this stage, the full weight of the body is on the back foot. •• Point of Contact: As one starts the forward movement of the racket, slowly start shifting the weight from the back foot to the front foot. The player then drops the shuttle and hit it high and Reprint 2025-26"}

The player must make sure that the point of contact is always below the waist. •• Follow-through: Once the service is delivered, the player continues to swing the racket right across the left shoulder (or right shoulder if the player is left-handed). This is called the follow through. 3. Return of Service: This stroke plays a crucial part in a rally because good return of serve allows a player to dictate terms and control a rally till the point is won. However weak return of serve will allow the opponent to go on the offensive. While receiving the serve to hit the shuttle, normally players stand in the centre of the court with the left foot forward and place the weight of the body more on the front foot. It will help the player to receive all types of serves i.e. high, low and flick. In fact, players are advised to take the stance closer to the short service because in high serve the shuttle remains in the air for a longer duration. On a high serve, a player has the choice of playing an attacking clear, drop shot, smash or a half smash. Similarly, on a low serve, a player can flick, push or lift the shuttle to the baseline. It is important to try to meet the shuttle as close to the net as possible so that the receiver has more options available to choose the shots. Gymnastics Gymnastics is a sport that involves physical movements in a sequence. It requires physical strength, balance, coordination, endurance, flexibility and body control. It often involves dance moves, flips, twists, jumps and other moves. It helps children to develop physical coordination and motor skills, proper use of balance develop a good sense of precision and timing. It can be performed as a way to stay fit or specifically to compete in events locally, nationally as well as internationally. History Gymnastics was developed for fitness and beauty practices by the ancient Greeks. It included skills for mounting and dismounting a horse, and circus performance skills. The Greeks used gymnastics as military training. However, in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, the German physical educators created exercises for boys and young men on apparatus. Their design is considered as modern gymnastics. The Federation of International Gymnastics was founded in 1881. By the end of the Reprint 2025-26"}

The first world cup in gymnastics was organised in 1975. Forms of gymnastics The major forms of gymnastics are: Artistic gymnastics, Rhythmic gymnastics, Trampolining, Tumbling and Acrobatic Gymnastics. Artistic gymnastics Artistic gymnastics is usually divided into Men’s and Women’s Gymnastics. Men compete in six events. These are floor exercise, pommel horse, still rings/roman rings, vaulting table, parallel bars, and horizontal bar. Women compete on four events. These are floor exercise, vaulting table, uneven bars, and balancing beam. 1. Events for men (i) Floor Exercise: For this event a 12×12 square spring floor is required. A series of tumbling passes are performed to demonstrate flexibility, strength, and balance. The gymnast must also show strength skills, including circles, scales, and press handstands. Men’s floor routines usually have four passes that will total between 50–70 seconds and are performed without music. As per rules, male gymnasts touch each corner of the floor at least once during their routine. (ii) Pommel Horse: A typical pommel horse exercise involves both single leg and double leg skills. Single leg skills are generally found in the form of scissors, often done on the pommels. Double leg skill, however, is the main staple of this event. The gymnast swings both legs in a circular motion (clockwise or counterclockwise depending on preference) and performs such skills on all parts of the apparatus. Gymnasts will often include variations on a typical circling skill by turning or by straddling their legs. This makes the exercises of gymnast more challenging. A gymnast performs a dismount, either by swinging his body over the horse or landing after a handstand. (iii) Still Rings: The rings are attached to a wire cable from a point to 5.75 meters from the floor, and adjusted in height so, that the gymnast has room to hang freely and swing. The gymnast performs a Fig. 5.4: Pommel horse Reprint 2025-26"}

At least one static strength move is required, but some gymnast includes two or three strenghts. A routine should have a dismount at the end of routine. (iv) Vault: In this, the gymnasts sprint down a runway, which is a maximum of 25 meters in length, before hurdling onto a spring board. The body position is maintained while “punching” (blocking using only a shoulder movement) the vaulting board. The gymnast then rotates to a standing position. Multiple twists and somersaults are added before landing in case of advance gymnastics. Vaults depend on the speed of the run, the length of the hurdle, the power the gymnast generated from the legs and shoulder girdle and the kinesthetic awareness in the air. In case of more difficult and complex vaults the speed of rotation is more important. (v) Parallel Bars: Men perform on two bars. These are kept slightly further than a shoulder’s width apart and usually 1.75 m high. For executing a series of swings, balances, and releases require great strength and co- ordination. (vi) Horizontal Bar: A 2.8 cm thick steel or fiberglass bar raised 2.5m above the landing area is all the gymnasts have to hold onto as they perform giants (revolutions around the bar), release skills, twists, and changes of direction. By using all of the momentum from giants and then releasing at the proper point, enough height can be achieved for spectacular dismounts. Leather grips are usually used to help maintain a grip on the bar. 2. Events for women (i) Floor Exercise: The floor event occurs on a carpeted 12m × 12m square, usually consisting of hard foam over a layer of plywood, which is supported by springs or foam blocks generally called a “spring” floor. Female gymnasts perform a choreographed routine of 50 to 70 seconds in this event. The routine should consist of tumbling lines, series of jumps, dance elements, acrobatic skills, and turns.

{"class": "class 9", "subject": "phe", "page_no": 72, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "Health and Physical Education - Class X 60 (ii) Vault: In the vaulting events gymnasts sprint down a 25 meters (82 ft) runway, jump onto or perform a round off entry onto a beat board or spring board, land momentarily, inverted on the hands on the vaulting horse or vaulting table. Then they spring off this platform to a two footed landing. Every gymnast starts at a different point on the vault runway depending on her height and strength. The post flight segment may include one or more multiple somersaults, and/or twisting movements. In vaults with round-off entries, gymnasts “round-off” so that hands are on the runway while the feet land on the springboard. From the round-off position the gymnast travels backwards as in a back handspring so that the hands land on the vaulting platform (horse). She then blocks off the vaulting platform into various twisting and somersaulting combinations. (iii) Uneven Bars: On the uneven bars (also known as asymmetric bars), the gymnast performs a routine on two horizontal bars set at different heights. The height is generally fixed, but the width may be adjusted. Gymnasts perform swinging, circling, transitional, and release moves, as well as moves that pass through the handstand. Usually in higher levels of gymnastics, leather grips are worn to ensure that the gymnast maintains a grip on the bar, and to protect the hands from blisters and tears. (iv) Balance Beam: The gymnast performs a choreographed routine from 70 to 90 seconds in length consisting of leaps, acrobatic skills, turns and dance elements on a padded spring beam. Apparatus norms set by the International Gymnastics Federation specify that the beam must be 125 cm (4’) high, 500 cm (16’) long, and 10 cm (4.5”) wide. The event requires in particular, balance, flexibility and strength. 3. Rhythmic gymnastics Only women compete in rhythmic gymnastics, although there is a new version of this discipline for men being pioneered in Japan. This combines elements of ballet, gymnastics, dance and apparatus manipulation. The sport involves the performance of five separate routines with the use of five apparatus – Ball, Ribbon, Hoop, Clubs, Rope on a floor area, with a much greater emphasis on the aesthetic rather than the acrobatic.

Acrobatic gymnastics Acrobatic gymnastics is one of the oldest forms of organised physical activities, and today it is being reorganised, revitalised by changes and renewed interest. The International Federation of Sports Acrobatics (IFSA) was founded in Moscow in 1973. United States Sports Acrobatics (USSA) was founded in 1975. It was merged with International Gymnastics federation (FIG) in 1999. Sports Acrobatics was demonstration sports at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. Now, it is an accepted competitive sport. It is very effective for the development of physical fitness and graceful posture. Acrobatic gymnastics is a group gymnastic discipline for both men and women. Acrobats in groups of two, three and four perform routines with the heads, hands and feet of their partners. They may, subject to regulations (e.g. instrumental), pick their own music. 5. Tumbling and trampolining Tumbling, also known as power tumbling, is a gymnastics sporting discipline which combines skills of artistic gymnastics with those of trampolining. It is sometimes practiced on a 25-meter-long spring track, competitors both male and female, perform two passes, each containing eight skills, along the track. Table Tennis Table Tennis is also known as Ping-Pong, in which two or four players participate using table-tennis rackets on a plain hard surface called Table, which is divided by a net. History The game of Table Tennis probably descended from the game of ‘Royal Tennis’, which was played in the medieval era (12th century A.D.) Table Tennis was probably played with improvised equipment in England during the last quarter of 19th century. Evidence show that David Foster in England patented an action game of Tennis on Table in 1890. One year later John Jaques came out with a game called Gossima. In 1900, a celluloid ball was introduced by Jaques and the name was given as ‘Ping-Pong’. Table Tennis is controlled by ITTF (International Table Tennis Federation) which was founded in 1926 with headquarters in Berlin. It was introduced in Olympics in 1988 in Seoul, South Korea. First World Championship of Table-Tennis was held in London in 1926. TTFI (Table-Tennis Federation of India) was formed in 1926 in Calcutta, now known as Kolkata. Reprint 2025-26"}

Fundamental techniques 1. Grip: Players grip their rackets in a variety of ways. The manner in which players grip their rackets can be classified into two major categories i.e. Pen hold grip (mainly used by Chinese and Korean) and shake hand or Orthodox grip (commonly used). •• Pen hold grip: In this, one grips the racket in such a way as one holds a pen. It involves index finger and think joining each other across the handle and curling the middle, ring and fourth finger on the back of the blade. The three fingers however, will always remain touching one another. Reprint 2025-26"}

The shake hand grip is used due to increasingly fast nature of the game, making the backhand stroke more effective. 2. Services: There are different kind, of services, such as, long service, short service, spin service, flat service, high toss service and back-hand or forehand service. 3. Types of strokes: The two types of strokes are offensive and defensive including backhand and forehand. (i) Offensive strokes (drive, loop drive, loop, loop kill, hook, counter drive, flip and smash) a) Drive: The racket is primarily perpendicular to the direction of the stroke, and most of the energy applied to the ball results in speed rather than spin, creating a shot that does not arc much, but it is fast enough to make it difficult to return. b) Loop drive: The racket is much more parallel to the direction of the stroke (closed) and the racket thus grazes the ball, resulting in a large amount of topspin. Variations in spin and speed add to the effectiveness of this shot. c) Loop: The loop produces a more pronounced loopy arc, with a higher trajectory and extreme topspin, but is typically slower. d) Loop kill: The loop kill produces a flatter arc, with higher speed that resembles a speed drive but with stronger topspin. e) Hook: It is similar to a regular Loop, but carries a tilted topspin (or is referred as the “top-side” spin), it bounces sideways and downward upon hitting the table. f) Counter drive: It is a counter attack against drives (normally high loop drives).

The racket is held closed and near to the ball, which is hit with a short movement off the bounce (before reaching the highest point) so that the ball travels faster to the other side. g) Flip: When a player tries to attack a ball that has not bounced beyond the edge of the table, however the ball may still be attacked, and the resulting shot is called flip because the back swing is compressed into a quick wrist action. h) Smash: Smash is executed when his or her opponent has returned a ball that bounces too high and/ or too close to the net. Smashing is a large back swing and rapid acceleration imparting as much speed on the ball as possible. (ii) Defensive strokes a) Push or Slice: The push is usually used for keeping the point alive and creating offensive opportunities. A push resembles a tennis slice, the racket cuts underneath the ball, imparting backspin and causing the ball to float slowly to the other side of the table. Offensive players should only push for variation and not for general rallies. b) Chop: A chop or cut is the defensive, backspin counterpart to the offensive loop drive. A chop is essentially a bigger, heavier slice, taken well back from the table. Sometimes a defensive player can impart no spin on the ball during a chop, or frequently add right- or left-hand spin to the ball. This may further confuse his/ her opponent. c) Block: A block is executed by simply putting the racket in front of the ball, the ball rebounds back toward the opponent with nearly as much energy as it came in with. This is not as easy as it sounds, because the ball’s spin, speed, and location, all influence the correct angle of a block. d) Side spin drive: The premise of this move is to put a spin on the ball either to the right or the left of the racket. The execution of this move is similar to a slice, but to the right or left, instead of down. This spin will result in the ball curving to the side but bouncing in the opposite direction when the opponent returns it. Reprint 2025-26"}

To execute a High Ball, a defensive player first backs off the table 8-10 meters; then, the stroke itself consists of simply lifting the ball to an enormous height before it falls back to the opponent’s side of the table. A High Ball is inherently a creative shot, and can have nearly any kind of spin. f) Drop shot: The drop shot is a high level stroke, used as another variation for close-to-table strokes. The player has position the racket close to the ball and just let the ball touch it (without any hand movement) in a way that the ball stays close to the net with almost no speed and spin, and touches the other side of the table more than twice if the opponent doesn’t reach it. Skills Forehand drive •• Keep arm close to the torso. •• Forearm makes 90° with the upper arm. •• Draw the forearm back to another 45°. •• Let the waist turn naturally along with the arm and shift your weight towards the right foot. •• Swing forward with a slight upward motion while shifting your weight back to left foot. •• Elbow should be used as a pivot point and should only move a little forward in the follow through.

The Davis Cup, an annual competition between men’s national teams, dates to 1900. The analogous competition for women’s national teams, the Fed Cup, was founded as the Federation Cup in 1963.

Equipment (i) Racquets: Tennis racquet must adhere to the following guidelines — •• The hitting area, composed of the strings, must be flat and generally uniform. •• The frame of the hitting area may not be more than 29 inches in length and 12.5 inches in width. •• The entire racquet must be of a fixed shape, size, weight, and weight distribution. There may not be any energy source built into the racquet. •• The racquet must not provide any kind of communication, instruction or advice to the player during the match. (ii) Balls: Tennis balls are of hollow rubber with a felt coating. Traditionally white, the predominant colour was gradually changed to optic yellow in the latter part of the 20th century to ensure better visibility. (iii) Court •• Tennis is played on a rectangular, flat surface, usually grass or clay, a hard court of concrete and/or asphalt and occasionally carpet (indoor). The court is 78 feet (23.77 m) long, and 27 feet (8.23 m) wide for singles matches and 36 ft (10.97 m) for doubles’ matches. •• Additional clear space around the court is required for players so as to reach over run balls. •• A net is stretched across the full width of the court, parallel with the baselines, dividing it into two equal ends. The net is 3 feet 6 inches (1.07 m) high at the posts and 3 feet (91.4 cm) high in the center. (iv) Lines •• The lines that delineate the width of the court are called the baseline (farthest back) and the service line (middle of the court). •• The short mark in the center of each baseline is referred to as either the hash mark or the center mark.

The baseline can be up to 4 inches (100 mm) wide if so desired. (v) Scoring •• The players (or teams) start on opposite sides of the net. One player is designated as the server, and the opposing player is the receiver. •• A tennis match is determined through the best of 3 or 5 sets. Women play 3 set matches, while men play 5 set matches. For men, the first player to win three sets wins the match, and for women, the first player to win two sets wins the match. •• A set consists of games, and a game, in turn, consists of a sequence of points played with the same player serving. •• A game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total and at least two points more than the opponent. •• The running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis: scores from zero to three points are described as “love”, “15”, “30”, and “40” respectively •• If at least three points have been scored by each player, making the player’s score equal at 40 a piece, the score is not called out as “40-40”, but rather as “deuce”. •• If at least three points have been scored by each side and a player has one more point than the opponent, the score of the game is “advantage” for the player in the lead.

The terminology is extended to sets (set point), matches (match point), and even championships (championship point). •• A break point occurs if the receiver, not the sever, has a chance to win the game with the next point. Break points are of particular importance because serving is generally considered advantageous, with the server being expected to win games in which they are serving. •• A receiver who has one (score of 30–40), two (score of 15–40) or three (score of love-40) consecutive chances to win the game has break point, double break point or triple break point, respectively. •• If the leading player wins that game, the player wins the set 7–5. If the trailing player wins the game, a tie-break is played. A tie-break, played under a separate set of rules, allows one player to win one more game and thus the set, to give a final set score of 7–6. •• In tournament play, the chair umpire announces the winner of the set and the overall score. 2. Grip A grip is a way of holding the racquet in order to hit shots during a match. There are three types of grip. i. Forehand: the tennis forehand is a stroke in which the inner side of the palm of the dominant hand that is holding the racket faces forward. The forehand stroke is made by swinging the racket across one’s body in the direction of where one wants to land the ball. ii. Backhand: The backhand is a tennis stroke in which one swings the racquet around one’s body with the back of the hand preceding the palm. iii. The Serve (Service): A serve in tennis is a shot to start a pint. A player will hit the ball with racquet so it will fall into the diagonally opposite service box without being stopped by the net.

FINA (Federation International de Notation) was formed at London Olympic in 1908 AD. National Swimming Association of India was founded in 1949. Swimming was one of the six sports at the First Asian Games held at Delhi in 1951. The aquatic sport of swimming involves competition amongst participants to be the fastest over a given distance. Different distances are covered in different levels of competition. Rules •• A swimmer must finish the race in the same lane.

It is highly competitive with the application of science. It is getting transformed from an art to science. Now, the importance is given to strategy and tactics for completing and pacing the race. In order to achieve the best performance, a swimmer must learn to distribute the distance economically and thoughtfully throughout the race. Tactics in swimming during different races can be categorised in three different phase — (i) Sprint races (ii) Middle distance races (iii) Long distance races Sprint races The 50 m race or the sprint race depends on the start, maintaining the speed and a good finish. Middle and Long distance races In these races, the key word is to build endurance and speed. In middle and long distance races, the swimmer tries to prevent building up high oxygen debt. Swimming at a very fast pace will accumulate a high level of oxygen debt early in the race and will experience an immediate drop in speed. Swimmer may sometimes prefer to begin faster than an ideal pace and attempt to get out in front avoiding the choppy waters. Some swimmers like to swim the strategy races in relation to the opponent.

In 1894, Naismith fixed the first 13 rules which still form the basis of modern basketball. In India, the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) at Kolkata introduced basketball for the first time. Later the YMCA established at Madras in 1920 played an important role in the development of this game. Today basketball is one of the most favourite games in many schools and colleges. The game is played by both men and women of all ages and ability. In order to promote Basketball at National and International levels the Basketball Federation of India was set up in 1950.

Fundamental skills We are well aware that, to play any game one has to learn some skills. Similarly to play basketball game a player should learn the following fundamental skills. Dribbling It is important to penetrate to score a basket, move the ball across the court, get away from the defenders, and find a good passing lane. There are different types of dribbling — •• basic dribble •• low dribbling •• high dribble •• behind the back •• crossover dribble •• change-of-pace •• between the legs dribble Passing A good offensive attack requires accurate passing from players. It helps find an open man, to find a good shooter or to get away from a defender.

Here are examples of the three basic categories of team defences. In addition, each category comprises of an assortment of different variations. •• Man to man defence: Man-to-man defences match up the defenders against specific offensive players. Defenders are usually assigned to be matched up with offensive players by size and ability. •• Zone Defence: In Zone defence, defenders are assigned to guard specific areas on the court. Zones are named or designated by their player alignments. •• Combined Defence: A third type of defence that can be deployed is the combination defence. With combina- tion defences, some of the players are assigned to play man-to-man while the rest of the defenders play zone. Combination defences are usually deployed in an effort to stop or neutralise great individual offensive players. Rebounding The objective of rebounding is to successfully gain possession of the basketball after a missed field point or free throw, as it rebounds from the ring or backboard. This plays a major role in the game, as most possessions end when a team misses a shot. There are two categories of rebounds: offensive rebounds, in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side and does not change possession, and defensive rebounds, in which the defending team gains possession of the loose ball. The majority of rebounds are defensive, as the team on defence tends to be in better position to recover missed shots. Reprint 2025-26"}

One team bats, trying to defend the wicket and scoring as many runs as possible. The other team bowls and fields, trying to dismiss the batsmen and thus limiting the runs scored by the batting team. A run is scored by the striking batsman hitting the ball with his bat, running to the opposite end of the pitch and touching the crease there without being dismissed. The teams switch between batting and fielding at the end of an inning. Reprint 2025-26"}

Cricket became a generally adopted sport in the second half of the seventeenth century. The Hambeldon club which was founded in about 1750’s had played a significant part in the evolution of the game. It was superseded by the Marylebone Cricket Club (M.C.C) with its headquarters at Lords, London. Cricket became an international game with the formation of the Imperial Cricket Conference (I.C.C) in 1909. The name of Imperial Cricket Conference was changed to International Cricket Conference (later, Council) to enable countries outside the common wealth to become its members. The first Limited Over International cricket match was played in 1971 at Melbourne. The governing International Cricket Council (ICC) saw its potential and staged the first limited over Cricket World Cup in 1975. The first edition of limited over Cricket world cup won by West Indies. In the 21st century, a new limited over form, Twenty 20, has made an immediate impact. The first T-20 international match took place on August 5 2004, between the women’s teams of England and New Zealand. The first T-20 international match between men’s teams was played on February 17 2005, between Australia and New Zealand. The first T-20 World Cup was played in South Africa in 2007. India won the first edition of T-20 World Cup. An all India team went on a tour of England in 1911 under Maharaja Bhupinder Singh of Patiala. The Indian Cricket Control Board came into being towards the end of 1928. The national championship for the Ranji Trophy began in 1935. India entered the international arena and played its first official Test against England in 1932. Meanwhile Prince Ranjit Singhji of Nawanagar who had gone to England for further studies, made a remarkable name for himself in the game of cricket.

One of the main cricket rules for batsmen to score runs is that they must run to the pitch at each other’s end (from one end to the other), hence score one run. Cricket rules state that, they may run multiple runs per shot. As well as while running they can also score runs by hitting boundaries. A batsman hits a boundary and scores 4 or 6 runs. A four and six both are scored by hitting the ball. If it crosses the boundary after touching the ground it is considered as four and if the ball crosses boundary before touching the ground it is considered as six. Cricket rules also state that once a 4 or 6 has been scored any runs physically scored by the batsman by running between the wickets are null and void. Other ways runs can be scored according to the cricket rules include no balls, wide balls, byes and leg byes. Cricket rules state that all runs scored by these methods are awarded to the batting team but not the individual batters. • • A No Ball can be declared for many reasons: If the heel of the bowler’s front foot lands on or in front of the popping crease or if the bowler’s back foot touches then outside the return crease the ball is declared no ball. If the bowler bowls the ball from the wrong place, the ball is declared dangerous (often happens when bowled at the batsmen’s body on the full), bounces more than twice or rolls before reaching the batsman or if fielders are standing in illegal positions. The batsman can hit a No ball and score runs off it but cannot be out from a No ball except if they are run out, hit the ball twice, handle the ball or obstruct the field. The batsman gains any runs scored off the no ball for his shot while the team also gains one run for the no ball itself. • • A Wide Ball will be declared if the umpire thinks the batsman did not have a reasonable opportunity to score off the delivery. However if the delivery is bowled over the batsmen’s head it will not be declared a wide but a no ball. Umpires are much stricter on wide deliveries in the shorter format of the game while being much more relaxed in test cricket. A wide delivery will add one run to the batting team and any runs scored by the batsman. The batsman is not supposed to be declared ‘out’ off a wide delivery except if they are stumped, run out, handle the ball, hit their wicket or obstruct the field. •• A Bye is where a ball that isn’t a no ball or wide passes the striking batsman and runs are scored without the batsman hitting the ball.

However no runs can be scored if the striking batsman didn’t attempt to play a shot or if he was avoiding the ball. Types of ‘out’ in cricket Ways batsmen can be given ‘Out’ according to cricket rules: There are a number of different ways a batsman can be given out in the game of cricket. When a bowler gets a batsman out it is said that the bowler gets a ‘wicket’. Following are the different ways, a batsman can be given out according to the rules of cricket: Fig. 6.9: Bowled •• Bowled – Cricket rules state that if the ball is bowled and hits the striking batsman’s wickets the batsman is given out (as long as at least one bail is removed by the ball). It does not matter whether the ball has touched the batsman’s bat, gloves, body or any other part of the batsman. However, the ball is not allowed to have touched another player or umpire before hitting the wickets. •• Caught – Cricket rules state that if a batsman while playing the ball, either it touches his bat, hand or glove holding the bat then the batsman can be caught out. This is done by the fielders, wicket keeper or bowler catching the ball on the full (before it bounces). If this is done then cricket rules state the batsman is out. •• Leg before Wicket (LBW) – If the ball is bowled and hits the .batsman first without touching the bat, then an LBW decision is possible.

If his, answer to this is yes and the ball was not pitched on the leg side of the wicket he can safely give the batsman out. However, if the ball hits the batsman outside the line of off stump while he was attempting to play a stroke then he is not out. •• Stumped – A batsman can be given out according to cricket rules when the wicketkeeper puts down his wicket while, he is out of his crease and not attempting a run (if he is attempting a run it would be a run out). •• Retired Out – A batsman leaves the field without the permission of umpire for any resource like, illness, injury etc. Than is given as retired out. •• Run Out – Cricket rules state that a batsman is out if no part of his bat or body is grounded behind the popping crease while the ball is in play and the wicket is fairly put down by the fielding side. •• Hit Wicket – Cricket rules specify that if a batsman hits his wicket down with his bat or body after the bowler has entered his delivery stride and the ball is in play then he is out. •• Handled the Ball – Cricket rules allow the batsman to be given out if he willingly handles the ball with the hand that is not touching the bat without the consent of the opposition or umpire. •• Timed Out – An incoming batsman must be ready to face a ball or be at the non strikers end with his partner within three minutes of the outgoing batsman being dismissed. If this is not done the incoming batsman can be given timed out. •• Hit the Ball Twice – Cricket rules state that if a batsman hits a ball twice other than for the purpose of protecting his wicket or with consent from the opposition, he is out. •• Obstructing the Field – A batsman is out if he intentionally obstructs the opposition by word or action There are many other cricket rules. However these are most of the basics and will get you well on your way to playing the game. Many of the more advanced rules and laws can be learned along the way and are not vital to general play. If any batsman leaves the field of play without the Umpire’s consent for any reason other than injury or incapacity, he may resume the innings only with the consent of the opposing captain. If he fails to resume his innings, he is out. For the purposes of calculating a batting average, retired out is considered a dismissal. Reprint 2025-26"}

On drive • • On drive is played to a over-pitched ball on and around the leg stump. • • This has been considered to be a difficult shot to play. The basic principles of a drive apply here too, though the swing of the bat is an arc from slips to mid- on with the front pointing down the wicket. • • The front foot should be placed outside the line of ball with the shoulders turned and the impact is just in front of the left toe. The follow through is generally checked below shoulder height. Back foot defence •• The back foot defensive stroke is played to a short- pitched ball in line with the stumps, which is not short enough to play and attacking shot. • • The back foot is moved back and across to the line of the ball with the front naturally following it. The bat is brought down close to the body with the head steady and over the ball. • • The back foot must remain parallel to the crease as far as possible to maintain the sideways position of the body with the top hand firm and in control, and the bottom hand holding the bat loosely. • • To keep the bat straight, the left elbow is held high next to the head. Care should be taken to maintain the balance at the time of playing the ball and to remain ‘side-on’ as this presents a smaller target for short rising deliveries. • • The back foot defence can also be played with the body beside the line of the ball, but here the batsman must resist the temptation to follow the movement of the ball away from him.

Also commonly known as soccer, it is a game that involves kicking a ball with the foot to score a point. It is played between two teams with a spherical ball on a rectangular field of grass or green artificial turf. There is a goal post at each end of the rectangular field and errected at the middle of base line. Points are scored by moving the ball to an opposing team’s end of the field and putting it between two goal posts. Players are required to move the ball by kicking, dribbling, carrying, and passing. The team that scores more points than the other by the end of the match wins the game. History According to FIFA (Federation International de Football Association), the “very earliest form of the game was played in china during the second and third centuries. The game was later developed in England and the rules of football were formulated in India, football began its journey when the British rulers brought it with them and in no time it became popular in the masses. The first recorded game here took place between the ‘Calcutta Club of Civilians’ and the ‘Gentlemen of Barrackpore’ in 1854. The first ever football club in India, the ‘Calcutta Football Club’ was founded in 1872. The first football association, “the Indian Football Association” (IFA) was established in Calcutta in 1893, though there was no Indian on its board till 1930s. It was later, replaced by All India Football Federation (AIFF). The Durand Cup Tournament is the oldest in India and the one of the oldest in the world, was started in Shimla in 1888. The decade of 1951 to 1962 is known as the golden era in the history of Indian football, as the country put up commendable performances in a number of international competitions.

Rules According to the official rules of football guide, the players need to execute the game in a fair and accepted manner. The football match is played in two halves of 45 minutes each. There are several rules in the game of football regarding the field, players, penalties, offence and defence. Start and restart of play A coin toss takes place before the game starts, the winner of the toss will get the choice of choosing the end to attack. At the kick-off, all players from each side must be in their own halves of the field. The kick-off takes place on the centre spot in the centre circle. The player who kicks off cannot touch it again until another player has made contact. Punishment for offences If the player persistently offends during a match, the referee can choose to take action. First the Yellow Card as a caution is shown to a player. Any offence after the second one leads to Red card. If they showed a red card to a player it means that player is expelled from the match. A straight red card (no previous caution) can be shown for extreme offences, such as, serious foul play, violent conduct, spitting, deliberately handling the ball to prevent a goal, a professional foul (denying a goal scoring opportunity) and insulting language and/or gestures. Free kicks Whenever a free kick is taken, the players on the opposite side must be at least 10 yards away from the ball until it is kicked. If this rule is not adhered to, the kick is retaken. There are two types of free kicks awarded, depending on the nature of the offence: (i) Direct Free Kick — allows the team to take a direct shot at the opponent`s goal. (ii) Indirect Free Kick — a direct strike on goal is not permitted. It means a second player has to touch the ball after the kick is taken to score a goal. Penalty kick A penalty kick is awarded for offences taking place in the penalty and goal areas. A nominated member of the team is allowed to strike at goal from the penalty spot, with only the goalkeeper to beat. The goalkeeper must remain on his line until the ball has been kicked, and all other players must be outside the penalty area behind the penalty spot. After the Reprint 2025-26"}

Throw-in A throw-in is awarded when the whole ball crosses the touch line (conceded by the team who last touched the ball). It is delivered on the field of play with both hands and from behind and over the player’s head. Otherwise it is deemed to be a foul throw and a throw-in is given to the opposition. It cannot go directly to the goalkeeper’s hands (if on the same team). A goal cannot be scored directly from a throw-in. Corner kick A corner kick is awarded once the whole ball crosses the goal line of the opposition, after touching one of their players. A kick is taken from the corner of whichever side the ball travelled over the field. Opponents must be 10 yards from the corner arc and the kicker cannot touch the ball a second time without having touched by any other player. Fundamental skills Receiving Receiving a ball on the ground is different than receiving a ball in air. Keep your eye on the ball, select the foot to receive the ball, don’t stop the ball, prepare it for new action or move, shot, dribble, pass. Passing Passing involves giving the ball to partners. Perfect decision making is required before a perfect pass. Before pass, see the target, approach the ball, and look at the ball holding the head steady. Strike the correct area of the ball with lacked ankle, make sure of follow through and transfer of weight forward. Shooting Shooting uses the same elements as used in passing, the difference is that the ball is to be passed to the goal keeper to convert the score for the team. Player should look up to see the position of goal keeper, choosing the area to shoot the ball while make a proper contact with the ball with proper follow through. Trapping It is a method of gaining control of the ball. Trapping uses the feet, thigh, or chest to bring the ball to the ground. Reprint 2025-26"}

It was during this time that the London Hockey Association was formed and the rules for playing hockey were standardised. In 1924, the International Hockey Federation (FIH) was founded and three years later, the International Federation of Women’s Hockey followed. In India, the first hockey club came up in Calcutta in 1885-86 and soon Bombay and Punjab followed. Making its Olympic debut at the 1928 Amsterdam Games, Indian hockey team won its first Olympic gold, without conceding a single goal. The hallmark of this ruthless domination was the wizardry of Indian hockey legend, Dhyan Chand, who mesmerised the Amsterdam crowd with his dazzling skills. From 1928 to 1956, India won six consecutive Olympic gold medals, while winning 24 consecutive matches. It was the golden era of Indian hockey, when India produced some of the finest players the game has ever seen.

A spot 0.15m in diameter, called the penalty spot, is marked with its centre 6.40 m from the centre of each goal. Equipment Each player carries a stick, normally a little over 3 feet (90 centimeters) long, 2 inches wide and traditionally made of wood but now often made with fiberglass, Kevlar and carbon fiber composites, with a rounded handle flattening out on one side and with a hook at the bottom. Rules The rules set by the International Hockey Federation FIH are used worldwide. General play Prior to the start of the game, a coin is tossed and the winning captain can choose a starting end or start with the ball. The game time is divided into four quarters of 15 minutes each 15-02-15-10-15-2-15. At the start of each quarter as well as after goals are scored, play is started with a pass from the centre of the field. Field players may only play the ball with the flat side of the stick. Tackling is permitted as long as the tackler does not make contact with the attacker or his stick before playing the ball (contact after the tackle may also be penalised if the tackle was made from a position where contact was inevitable). Further, the player with the ball may not deliberately use his body or stick to shield the ball from a legitimate tackle. When the ball passes over the sidelines, it is returned to play from sideline either by individual player by himself or with a push or hit, taken by a member of the team whose players were not the last to touch the ball before crossing the sideline. If it crosses the goal line after last touched by an attacker, a 15 mt hit or pass can be made by any player of the defending team. A 15 mt hit is also awarded for offenses committed by the attacking side within 15 mt of the end, of the pitch they are attacking. Free hits Free hits are awarded when offences are committed outside the scoring circles. The ball may be hit or pushed once in any direction by the team offended against. Opponents Reprint 2025-26"}

Penalty corner The penalty corner is set play that is awarded against a defending team when any offence is committed in the defensive circle, and may be awarded when a deliberate offence is committed in the defending 23 m area, or when the defending team deliberately plays the ball over the back line. Penalty stroke A penalty stroke is awarded when defenders commit a deliberate foul in the circle which deprives an attacker of possession or the opportunity to play the ball. This penalty is being taken by a single attacker against the goalkeeper, and is taken from a spot 6.4 m from the penalty spot and directly in front of the goal. The goalkeeper must stand with heels on the goal line, and cannot move his feet until the ball is played. On the umpire’s whistle, the striker may push or flick the ball at the goal, which the goalkeeper attempts to save. The player taking the penalty shot may not touch the ball twice. Hitting or dragging or tapping the ball is also forbidden. If the shot is saved, play is restarted with 15 mt hit to the defenders; if a goal is scored, play is restarted from the centre line.

Each team works together to hit an inflated ball over a high net. Each team tries to score points by grounding the ball on the other team’s court. Volleyball is a rebound game where one cannot hold or catch the ball; every contact must be a rebound action. It is essential for the player to be in the right place at the right time if the game is to be played in a controlled manner. Therefore, good anticipation and movement skills should be taught to players. At competency level, students should learn and practice the basic skills of sending and receiving the ball over a high net. They should play simple 3 touch volleyball games working as a team to keep the ball in play and ground it on the opponent’s side of the court. History Originally named Mintonette, it was created as a gentle indoor sport for older players to be able to exert a bit of athletic effort by keeping the ball in the air. The idea of using a net was borrowed from tennis. It was raised to a height above the average man’s height. During a demonstration game, someone remarked that the players seemed to be volleying the ball back and forth over the net, and perhaps “volleyball” would be a more descriptive name for the sport. The game of Volleyball was invented by William G. Morgan in the year 1895 in Holyoke, Massachusetts by YMCA (USA). It was invented as a recreational game.

A player on one of the teams begins a ‘rally’ by serving the ball from behind the back line of the court, over the net, and into the receiving team’s court. The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court. The rally continues, with each team allowed up to three consecutive touches, until either a team grounds the ball on the opponent’s court and wins the rally or a team commits a fault and loses the rally. The team that wins the rally is awarded a point, and serves the ball to start the next rally. The ball is usually played with the hands or arms, but players can legally strike or push the ball with any part of the body. Common faults include — •• catching and throwing the ball; •• two consecutive contacts with the ball made by the same player; •• four consecutive contacts with the ball made by the same team; •• touching the net during play; •• crossing the centre line; and •• violation of rotation.

It is played throughout Asia with minor modifications. Kabaddi is quite new to the other parts of the world. It was known by various names in different parts of India. For example, Chedugudu or Gudu- gudu in Southern parts of India, Ha-du-du (Men), Chu-kit- kit (Women) in Eastern India, Hu-tu-tu in Maharashtra in western India and Kabaddi in Northern India. It is a game of attack and defense. The two teams occupy opposite halves of a field and take turn in sending a ‘Raider’ into the other half. In order to win points, members of the opposite team are tagged and the raider tries to return to half, holding the breath and chanting, “Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi”.

There is also another school of thought, in India, which believes that this game is a version of Chakravyuha, used in Mahabharata. The game was demonstrated for the first time at the international level during 1936 in Berlin Olympics by Hanuman Vyayam Pracharak Mandal, Amravati, Maharashtra. The game was introduced in the Indian Olympic Games at Calcutta in 1938. In 1950, the All India Kabaddi Federation came into existence and compiled standard rules. The Amateur Kabaddi Federation of India (AKFI) was founded in 1973. After formation of the AKFI, the first men’s nationals were held in Madras (Chennai), while the women’s were held in Calcutta (Kolkata) in 1955. The Asian Kabaddi Federation (AKF) was founded in 1978. AKF is affiliated to Olympic Council of Asia. The parent body designated to regulate the game at the international level is International Kabaddi Federation (IKF). The Kabaddi World Cup was first played in 2004, then in 2007 and 2010.

Fundamental skills Skills The skills used by the raider in kabaddi are called offensive skills. The skills used by the antis are called defensive skills. During a raid, the raider has to make maximum use of his limbs to come in contact or touch the opponents in order to score points. This is accomplished through leg touches, such as, toe touch, foot touch, squat leg, thrust, kicks, etc., with lower limbs and through hand touches with upper limbs. Offensive skills a) Touch: Touch is a fundamental and the easiest skill, which every raider applies in one or the other forms. There are different kinds of touches such as — (i) Hand touch: (a) running hand touch (b) stooping hand touch (c) turning hand-touch (d) hopping hand touch (e) fake and touch (ii) Toe touch: This offensive skill is used by almost every raider.

During the course of a raid, the raider will move in different angles, according to the positions and moves of the opponents. At the same time, in order to apply this skill, the raider requires to extend his leg towards the opponent suddenly. (iii) Foot touch: The modern toe touch is a moderate form of foot-touch. The major difference between these two skills is that in foot-touch, the raider tries to touch the opponents with complete foot whereas in toe touch, toe is used to touch the opponents. This skill helps the raider to cover more area in the opponent’s court and has an advantage over toe touch. b) Mule kick: It is very useful in critical situations. Mule kick is a thrust or blow in the air, by the raider, with leg, to touch an anti. There are various types of kicks, such as — i. Back kick: Kicking the anti who comes behind the raider during the course of raid is known as back kick. The different forms of back kick are: (i) running back kick (ii) standing back kick (iii) fake and kick (iv) taking a turn and back kick. ii. Side kick: Raiders who raid from second to second and attack the central zone will find this skill the most suitable. The method and principle of kick are the same as in the case of back kick. The only difference between the two is that the area to be covered is sideward. iii. Curve kick is also called a mule kick as the leg lifted to kick at the anties takes a curve from back to the side. This type of kick will enable the raider to cover more area with the attacking leg. At the same time it enables the raider to change his direction. Defensive skills a) Ankle hold: This is a counter skill used by defensive players against leg thrusts and foot touches during an attack or raid. A team, which has mastery over ankle hold, can plan different strategies and tactics in various situations, such as, (a) lifting up (b) pulling back (c) changing direction of the raider.

Every team uses this technique as a planned and surprise tactic. For example: (a) Taking one step forward and hold — Taking one step forward means holding the raider’s thigh on wrong step or rear leg (b) thigh hold from behind. c) Waist hold or trunk hold: Waist hold is a skill used by a defender to catch the raider from behind. d) Wrist hold: Wrist hold is also a defensive skill and used occasionally only when a situation presents itself. This hold is rarely used now a days. e) Blocking: It is a defensive skill used by covers and corners. Blocking is an act of creating a wall of obstruction in the path of the raider to prevent the movement. The aim of blocking is not just to obstruct the path, but also to catch the raider. Tactics Tactics means exploiting a given situation to one’s advantage. This is also done to create a situation to suit one’s purpose. The raider may increase or decrease the tempo of the game depending on the situation. In order to do this the player may adopt a passive raid or an aggressive raid by creating a situation for a struggle. Sometimes the raider may pass time in the last few minutes of the game, especially when the team is leading and the opponents are playing an aggressive game. Keeping in view the game situation, different tactics adopted by the raider. Retreat Unless the raider returns to home court safely after the raid, the raid cannot be treated as successful. This is called a retreat. The raider has to pre-plan the path of retreat before starting the raid. While retreating to home court, the raider should keep the following points in view — •• The raider does not give room for pursuit. •• The raider regains their defensive position quickly before the opponent team’s raider begins the raid. •• While returning to home court, the raider must pass only through the midline. Raid Raid is the offence part of the game. The main feature of the game is raiding on the opponent’s court, alternatively by both the team players. The defence is done with teamwork while only one player makes an attack. Reprint 2025-26"}

Kho-Kho Kho-Kho is one of the most popular traditional team sport in India. It is the simplest form of chasing and touching a person. It is an inexpensive and enjoyable sport that demands physical fitness and a set of skills. Dodging, feigning and bursts of controlled speed make this game quite thrilling. To catch by pursuit is to chase, rather than just run — is the main skill of Kho-Kho. This game is played in two innings by two teams on a rectangular court. One team becomes the chasers and the other the runners. In the game, the chaser pursues the runners and touches them and puts them out. Each team has to chase and defend for 9 minutes twice in a match. Fig. 7.3: Player playing kho-kho History In the ancient era, a version of the Kho-Kho game was played on ‘raths’ or chariots in Maharashtra, and this was known as Rathera. The Kho-Kho rules were first framed in the early 1900’s. A committee was formed at Puna Gymkhana in 1914 for framing the Kho-Kho rules and the first ever book of Kho- Kho rules was published from Baroda Gymkhana in 1924. The year 1936 was the year of the golden opportunity for the game of Kho-Kho when Berlin Olympic Games featured an exhibition of Kho-Kho in the main stadium. The Hanuman Vyayam Prasarak Mandal of Amravati was the proud demonstrators in that exhibition.

In the term judo, ‘ju’ means ‘gentle’ and ‘do’ means ‘the way or path’. Judo was developed in Japan in the late 19th century by using the principles of balance and leverage adapted from jujutsu. Its most prominent feature is its competitive element, where the objective is to either throw or putdown one’s opponent to the ground, immobilise or otherwise subdue one’s opponent with a grappling maneuver, or force an opponent to submit by joint locking or by executing a stranglehold or choke. Strikes and thrusts by hands and feet as well as self-defense are a part of judo. Many are trained in Judo either for participation in competition or self-defense. History The history of judo starts with Japanese jujutsu. It was created by Professor Jigoro Kano and he believed that the techniques could be practiced as a competitive sport if the more dangerous techniques were omitted. By 1910 Judo was a recognised sport that could be safely engaged in and in 1911 it was adopted as a part of Japan’s educational system. In the same year, the Kodokan Judo Instructors’ Training Department, Kodokan Black Belt Association and Japan Athletic Association were formed. World War II saw a different development of Judo. Instead of being used for sport, Judo was being taught as a combat skill. Those selected for commando and special services training often achieved a high standard of expertise. When Japan hosted the 1964 Olympics, Judo was given its first opportunity as an event. Of the 16 medals awarded for Judo, Japan won three gold medals, and one silver medal. Judo was no longer a Japanese sport but had developed to become an international sport. There have been two main developments in Judo over the years. The first was the introduction of weight categories. Earlier everyone fought everyone else, with the result that, if two players were equally matched in skill, the bigger man usually won. Initially there were three categories, and later this was made into five. Inclusion of the sport in the Olympic Games in 1964 helped to hasten this important reform. There are different styles of Judo. With its inclusion in the Olympics, there has been a shift towards a contest style practice. In clubs where this style is taught, the practice becomes largely a continuous contest. Other schools stress on skills. They favour repetitive movements to make them instinctive and the development of speed through practice with little resistance. Fig. 7.5: Player playing Judo Reprint 2025-26"}

There is one referee who walks around inside the contest area and conducts the match. There are two judges who sit diagonally across the mat from one another, each in a corner. The two judges assist the referee and indicate when the contestant goes outside of the contest area. The referee is in charge of awarding points and accessing penalties and uses hand gestures to signal his decision. However, if a judge disagrees with a call, then the three officials take a vote and the decision is decided by a majority vote. In addition to the Judge and Referees there are also scorekeepers and timers. There is usually a scoreboard, which displays points and penalties and it can either be electronic or manual. Medical personnel are also on hand in the event of injury to a contestant. Contestants The two contestants, who are known as Judokas, compete for 5 minutes for men and 4 minutes for women. One contestant wears white uniform and the other a blue uniform. Uniforms The judokas wear loose-fitting judo uniforms called judogi, consisting of pants, a jacket and a belt. Judogi is made up of loose-fitting pants, a jacket and a belt that is tied around the waist. The jacket and pants are made of cotton. They are either blue or white and they are made so a rival should be able to get a grip on either one of them so as to be able to make a judo throw. One judoka will wear white the other blue. The belt is three meters long and it is wrapped around the waist twice. The color of the belt signifies the rank the combatant has reached. Competition area The entire competition area in judo is 46 to 53 feet square (14 to 16 meters). This area is made up of foam mats commonly referred to as tatami mats and the individual mats are 6.5 feet by 3.281 feet wide (2 meters long, a 1-meter wide). Inside the competition area is a contest area, which is 8-10 meters square. This contest area (shiaijo) is green in color, that would be 29.5 feet square (9-meters) and it will have a 3.281 foot (1-meter) red boundary around it. This is the danger zone and it alerts the competitor(s) (judoka) that they are about to go out of bounds. The area outside the danger zone is the safety zone. This zone is three meters wide and it is the out-of-bounds area. Reprint 2025-26"}

These two pieces of tape mark the place where the judoka will stand when they begin and end each bout. Contest A random draw, in the same weight category, is used to determine which contestants will be fighting each other. In the Olympic Games there are two pools, and each pool has its own single-elimination tournament. The two pool winners will compete for the gold medal, with the loser of this contest winning the silver medal. In each pool, the competitors who lose to a pool winner are then entered into a repechage round which is also a single-elimination tournament. The winners of the repechage pools will be the winners of the bronze medals. To win the contest a Judoka must score an Ippon a score that equals 10 points by using successful Judo techniques. If neither of the Judokas is able to score an Ippon or 10 points by the end of the match, the winner will be the Judoka who has scored the most points. In the event of a tie, for the first time at the 2004 Olympic Games, the “Golden Score” rule was used. If there is no winner after the five-minute period has ended, the referee announces the beginning of “Golden Score”. This will extend the match for an extra five- minute period and the contestant who scores the first point is declared the winner of the match. Judo penalties Two types of penalties may be awarded. One is shido and another is hansoku. After two shido are given, the third shido becomes hansoku-make and the victory is given to the opponent. This is an indirect hansoku-make and does not result in expulsion from the tournament. Wrestling Considered as one of the most ancient and oldest sport in the world, wrestling has also been equally popular in India. It is a form of combat sport involving grappling type techniques such as clinch, fighting, throws, take downs, joint locks and other grappling holds. A wrestling bout is a physical competition, between two (occasionally more) competitors or partners, who attempt to gain and maintain a superior position. There are a wide range of styles with varying rules, such as, traditional, historic and modern styles.

In India also it received regular patronage from the Emperors and Kings. Wrestling in India then was popularly known as Malla Yuddha. In famous Indian epic, Mahabharata, Bhima was considered to be a great wrestler of that time and some of the other great wrestlers included Jarasandha, Duryodhana, and Karna. Another Indian epic, Ramayana also mentions about wrestling and Hanuman is described as one of the great wrestlers of that time. Wrestling in India continued to increase its popularity during modern days. Even during the British rule, wrestling in India got encouraging support, as the British rulers included the game into the military practice. In fact, India was considered among the top 10 countries in wrestling till the 1960s. India also hosted the World Wrestling Championship at New Delhi in 1967. The term Kushti, which means wrestling, denotes both a local form of the art as well as a more global combat. Kushti is composed of three primary dimensions: dao, pench, and paintra (moves, counter-moves, and stance). There may be similarities between the daos known as multani, dhobi pat, and kalajangh and the corresponding freestyle moves known as arm drag, front hip throw, and fireman carry. But what is significantly different about wrestling in India is that wrestlers mostly wrestle in mud pits, engage in bouts that last for half an hour or more. At other times and under other circumstances Indian wrestlers follow clearly defined international guidelines, rules, and regulations. Do You Know? In 2008, Sushil Kumar brought 2nd Bronze Medal for India at Beijing Olympic Games. This feat was repeated at 2012 Olympics games by Sushil Kumar (Silver Medal) and Yogeshwar Dutt Bronze Medal.

Stress generally occurs as a result of major events in life, such as, tough competitions, getting low scores in an examination, recent break-up in friendship, not getting a good job, a fight with others, and so on. There are several other factors which may cause stress in a person, like, diseases, poor living conditions, poverty, problems in relationship, challenges of adolescence, wrong habits, high aspirations, unrealistic goals, death of a close relative, discrimination, fast changing life and many others. However, sometimes it may also occur due to minor issues, such as, not getting up early, not getting ready on time, reaching school late, not getting the desired food, arguments with a friend, not getting permission from parents for attending a late night party, and so on. Intensity of stress varies from person to person and generally depends on perception of a particular situation by that person. A situation may be easy to handle for one person, while it may pose a big challenge to another. For example, examination may cause stress in one student, while it may not affect another student. Stress which motivates us to perform better and learn new skills is beneficial. For example, getting admission in a new course, preparing for an examination or getting promotion may cause stress but this stress is beneficial as it finally contributes towards growth and development. Stress may be harmful also. When stress is severe and chronic it reduces efficiency of a person. This kind of stress may adversely affect our ability to feel, think and act. During severe stress, people may become restless and worried. They may not remember the things properly. Even small things may make them angry. You also might have observed that when you are in tension you become restless. You may not be able to focus on your studies and small things may cause irritation. Chronic and severe stress reduces our body’s ability to fight diseases. It can lead to various psychosomatic diseases, such as, peptic ulcer, migraine, diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, etc. It could even result in heart attack, brain stroke and death. Several psychological disorders, such as, anxiety attacks and depression may Activity 8.1 Think and discuss the following with your friends: Questions •• Have you ever experienced stress? •• What was the cause of it? •• How did you manage it? •• Can you think any other way by which you could have better managed it?

However, the fact is — we cannot avoid stress. Therefore, management of stress is necessary Yoga as a Way of Life for Stress Management Yoga has been considered a panacea for managing the stress. In this context, we will discuss the role of yoga in developing a healthy lifestyle by which stress can be managed. Yoga practices when become a way of life, play an important role in stress management. You have learnt about asana, pranayama, kriya, mudra, bandha and meditation in Class IX. However, yoga is not limited to the physical postures, breathing techniques or meditation for a few minutes only. Rather yoga is a way of life also. It propounds several principles and practices, such as, asana, pranayama, kriya, mudra, bandha and meditation which are relevant to healthy living. Yogic principles and practices of healthy living can be adopted by all, irrespective of age, gender, profession or place. As a way of life, yoga gives direction about food, eating habits, thinking, recreational means and conduct. Yogic way of life, if adopted in true sense, empowers us to deal with stress and promote physical and mental health. The components of yogic way of life are — •• Ahara (Food) •• Vihara (Relaxation) •• Achara (Conduct) •• Vichara (Thinking) •• Vyavahara (Behaviour or actions) Ahara The principles of ahara are related to food consumption. Yoga emphasises on mitahara, which is related to quality and quantity of food and also the state of mind during the intake of food. As for the quality, the concept of mitahara implies that food should be freshly cooked, nutritious, nourishing and in the natural form. Regarding quantity of food, mitahara mentions that two quarters of the stomach should be filled with food, one quarter with liquid and the remaining quarter (one‑fourth) should be left empty for free flow of air. This implies that quantity of food may vary from person to person depending upon the individual requirements. It is very natural that a sportsperson will require more food as compared to a person who is doing desk job. Mitahara also advocates that the food should be eaten with positive state of Reprint 2025-26"}

You might have observed if someone eats while watching the television or in an angry mood or when the person’s attention is somewhere else, then they tend to just gulp down the food without enjoying it. So, the state of mind is also very important while eating. Thus, mitahara emphasises that right quality and quantity of food should be eaten in a positive state of mind. Activity 8.2 In Column I, put a list of food items that you like eating and in Column II put the food items that you consider good for your health. Column I Food items that you like eating Column II Food items that you consider good for health Questions • • Compare the items of both the columns. Do the items in Column I tally with those in Column II? • • Do you think that you need to change your food habits? Make a separate list indicating which food items from the list (Column I) you want to change. Vihara Vihara means relaxation, which can be brought about by activities, such as, exercise, recreational and creative activities like drawing, painting, singing, etc. These activities help to regulate and channelise our emotions and bring us joy and happiness. Yogic practices of asana, pranayama and meditation relax body and mind. In addition to this, relaxation can be attained in good company also. Sound sleep is also important for relaxation. It is, therefore, important that we should regularly follow a timetable that provides adequate time for yogic and creative activities which are relaxing.

Right conduct is essential for a stress-free life. Positive emotions and positive attitudes, good habits and control on desires help in making us strong, both, individually and socially. The right conduct protects us from unnecessary stress caused by negative emotions and attitudes like hate, jealousy, fear, etc. Therefore, we should have control on our desires, instincts, emotions, habits and attitudes. Here, yoga is important as it encourages good conduct in our personal and social life. Yoga advocates for positive emotions and positive attitude towards self and other persons. In this context yogic principles of Yama (restraint) and Niyama (observance) help to develop control on our desires and emotions and bring about peace and harmony. Yama (Restraint) and Niyama (Observance) Yamas (restraints) and Niyamas (observances) are sets of the dos and the don’ts. They can be considered as the universal codes of conduct that help us in following high standards in our personal and social life. Yamas are concerned with one’s social life; while the niyamas are concerned with one’s personal life. Yama and Niyama are part of Ashtanga Yoga that has been propagated by Patanjali. The five yamas are ahimsa (non-violence), satya (truthfulness), asteya (non stealing), brahmcharya (celibacy) and aparigraha (non possessiveness). The five niyamas are: Shaucha (cleanliness), Santosha (contentment), Tapas (austerity), Swadhyaya (self study) and Ishwarpranidhana (surrender to god). Vichara We know that thoughts are very important as our behaviour is guided by the kind of thoughts we have. Our thinking should be positive. Positive thoughts bring pleasure to our life; while negative thoughts can make us unhappy. Right thinking guides us towards appropriate behaviour. It helps in prevention and management of stress-related health problems. Yoga prescribes that one should have positive thoughts. Positive thoughts give us strength to bear the sorrows of life. Yogic practices like yama, niyama, pratyahara, dhyana (meditation), study of good literature, etc., help us in controlling our thoughts and thereby promoting optimism in life. Activity 8.4 Ramesh and his friends are planning to skip their classes and go for a movie instead. Ramesh is worried as he feels that it is not right to skip the class without informing his parents. But at the same time, he does not want to be seen as a spoilsport by his friends. Finally, he succumbed to the peer pressure. Now, he is disturbed to think what would happen if his parents come to know of it. Questions •• Why was Ramesh worried? •• Was his conduct appropriate? Explain your answer. •• Can you suggest some ways to get out of this conflicting situation? •• What would you do, if you were in Ramesh’s place? •• Do you think the yogic principles of Yama (restraint) and Niyama (observance) help to develop control on our desires and emotions and lessen our stress?

We should not indulge in wrong activities. Our behaviour towards others should be appropriate. Karma‑ yoga proposes that we should perform right and act with full dedication and to our utmost capacity without worrying about the results. We can remain stress-free and be happy if we follow this philosophy and act accordingly.

To achieve optimal level of fitness certain dietary considerations are required. Mostly food is consumed for its taste or appearance; however, both nutritive value and quality of food need attention. Food quality, food adulteration, food spoilage and impact of indiscriminate use of pesticide and radiation on human health have been discussed in this lesson. Dietary Planning Dietary planning is an important step in proper food selection and preparation of meal to stay healthy and fit. Dietary planning is a process of developing meal plans for adequate nutrition within the available resources. Nutritional requirement and food choices vary with regard to their age, sex, activity level and physiological condition. Food is planned accordingly to make it enjoyable, satisfying and healthy. Planning is a scientific method of saving energy, time and money. It makes the tasks of procuring raw material, preparing meals and ensuring food quality simpler. It adds variety the meals and reduces wastage. You have studied the five food groups in Class IX. Revise these and for reference keep these handy. Factors Affecting the Planning Everybody needs a balanced diet irrespective of age but certain factors influence the food choices. Consider the following factors while planning meal for good health and fitness. Age Body’s need for food and nutrients varies greatly with age. An infant needs only mother’s milk initially but needs extra Dietary Considerations and Food Quality 9 Activity 9.1 •• Plan a meal (lunch or dinner) including some food from each food group. •• Record your one day diet.

Adolescents grow at a fast pace and are active, so they need extra nourishment. But their food preferences are often influenced by friends and media rather than nutritional requirement. They need guidance in this regard. Nutritious food preparations can be planned in the form they enjoy, like spinach paratha or spinach, carrot and potato soup instead of spinach vegetable. Elders often have difficulty in chewing, swallowing and digestion; they need soft and easily digestible foods, such as, well cooked vegetables, idli etc. Gender Nutritional requirements vary with gender. Till the age of 10 years nutritional requirements are same, thereafter both grow at different pace and their body composition is also different. Mostly men are taller and heavier than women. They are more muscular while women have more fat cells. Thus, their body types are different leading to different nutrient requirements. Females need more iron (hemoglobin) due to blood loss during menstruation. Lack of iron often puts them at high risk of iron deficiency or anemia. Whole grains, seasonal fruits, green leafy vegetables and dairy products are healthy for both genders. Food preferences may also vary with gender. Physical activity Energy and nutrient requirements vary with physical activity. Sitting jobs like reading, computer work, etc., need less energy and heavy duty tasks like cycling, carrying heavy load, sports, etc., need more energy. Intensity and duration of activity also affect the requirements, e.g., a person cycling normally needs lesser energy than a person participating in a race, need nutrients, like vitamin B, in accordance with energy requirement. In general energy from fried foods, extra butter or ghee needs to be avoided. Food preparations from whole foods, nuts, oilseeds, dairy foods, egg, and fish can fulfill the requirement for energy and other nutrients. Physiological state Physiological conditions like infancy, childhood, adolescence, pregnancy, lactation impose high demands of food and nutrients due to higher rate of growth and development. For example, a healthy sedentary woman needs 1900 kcal/day while the same woman, if pregnant, will need 2200 kcal. Similarly an adult man needs 0.8 g protein/Kg body weight/day. The same person if an athlete requires 2.0g protein/Kg body weight/day. Foods like laddoo (rich in calories) are quite suitable for highly active and growing persons while those with sedentary life style should avoid them to prevent becoming overweight.

Physiological state also affects the food preferences. Economic considerations Some foods are expensive while others are cheap but both may provide similar nutritional benefits, e.g., cashew nuts are expensive, groundnuts are cheap and both are good sources of fat, protein, vitamins and minerals. Seasonal, local, fresh foods are cheaper and more nutritious. The cost of a food item also varies from one place to another. Purchasing from whole sale markets, haats, etc., is economical. Homemade food is cheaper. Time and skill The number and types of dishes served in a meal depend on the availability of time, ingredients, equipment and skills of the person who cooks. Lack of these may influence the quality of the meal. Hence, it is necessary to plan in such a way that nutritional quality is maintained. Preplanning and time management skills are useful in preparing nutritious meal in lesser time. All members of the family, including children, need to be engaged in food preparation activities in an appropriate manner. Region, religion and culture Eating habits are often linked with the foods produced in the localily, e.g., people living in coastal areas eat more fish or coconut is popular in Kerala. When the same food is consumed over a period of time it becomes cultural practice. Religion also influences the food habits e.g., the Jain community does not eat onion, garlic, eggs, fish, meat, etc., However, mobility, technology and various modern factors are lessening such impacts. Certain foods are associated with festivals like, gujia in Holi. Food preferences of individuals Food preferences vary from person to person and strongly affect planning of meals, e.g., a vegetarian cannot eat meat and a non-vegetarian will not get satisfaction with only vegetarian dishes. People from south India will get satisfaction with idli sambhar instead of dal roti. Occasional change is accepted but dissatisfaction resulted from less preferred food over a long period of time may lead to under-eating, malnutrition and health problems.

For example, papad has to be crisp and bread soft; ice cream chilled and soup hot. This has to be given due consideration. Related concepts Taste is a sensation perceived in the mouth and throat. There are four tastes, i.e., sweet, salt, bitter, sour. The fifth taste is referred to as umami which is similar to the taste of monosodium glutamate (MSG). Ayurveda describes six tastes namely, sweet, salt, bitter, sour, pungent and astringent which can easily be linked with the tastes of sugar, salt, neem, lemon, chilli and amla respectively. Flavour is sensed by both nose and tongue together. It includes both aroma and taste. Lemon has lemony flavor and sour taste. Specific compounds when present in a certain food give them distinct flavor and can also be modified by processing. Satiety value Satiety value implies a sense of pleasure and satisfaction that a person gets from eating food. While planning meals, it is important to take care that it keeps one satisfied for sufficient time and does not lead to hunger pangs soon. This in turn will affect the working capacity, efficiency and health of a person. Media and advertisement Many persons, particularly children, choose food tempted by advertisements. Further they choose a certain food because it is available on discount or as a free gift. Such practice is common with some processed, packaged and ready to eat foods. These items may initially attract, appear cheap but on regular use they may turn out to be costly, less nutritious and unhealthy. Hence it is necessary to see nutrition facts on the label of the packing to make healthy food choices. Using the same concept to advertise nutritious foods will encourage people to choose and consume healthy diets. Accessibility and transport Foods available nearby are usually selected. It commonly happens with people living in remote areas, elders, handicaps and persons not having requisite transport facilities. Famines, droughts, heavy rainfall, cyclones and road blockages further limit the food supply. Big bazaars, home delivery system and online purchase have improved the access to food. Local haats are organised which are also good sources of cheap and fresh food items.

Adequate nutrition is of utmost importance for their health, physical fitness, endurance, peak performance and prevention of dehydration, injury and infection. The right kind of food given at the right time in right proportion is of paramount importance for sportpersons to prolong their sporting life. Carbohydrates Carbohydrates are major sources of energy for sportpersons. For general fitness, 3-5 g carbohydrate per Kg body weight per day is sufficient. For intensive sport like football, gymnastic, weight lifting, 5-10 g carbohydrate per Kg body weight per day may be required. Body stores of carbohydrate (glycogen) must be sufficient before and during exercise. Glycogen stores determine the stamina and performance. For one hour of exercise, no extra intake except water is needed. Carbohydrate requirement increases with increasing duration of workout. Timing of carbohydrates intake is vital. Intake of high carbohydrate, easily digestible food, 2-4 hours before training and event are advisable for quick energy release and replenishment in the body. Food preparations having potato (baked), bread, rice, semolina (suji), and banana along with liquid food are suggested. Excessive consumption of carbohydrates may lead to weight gain, cause digestive discomfort, muscle stiffness, diarrhea, lethargy, etc., and eventually hamper the performance. Protein Depending upon the intensity of the sport, protein requirement can range from 1.2 -2.0g per kg body weight per day. Sufficient intake of carbohydrates ensures that protein is used for building and repairing of muscles and tissues; for formation of hormones, enzymes, antibodies and neurotransmitters; preventing damage; and not for giving energy. For better utilisation of protein, consume carbohydrate and protein food sources in appropriate proportion, preferably 3:1 or 4:1 for better performance in endurance events. Foods like egg, whey protein, soy and milk (casein), low fat dairy products, grains, nuts, seeds and beans provide good quality protein. Readymade protein powders should be avoided or taken under expert supervision only. Low protein intake makes sportpersons susceptible to fatigue, Activity 9.3 •• Make a diet plan for your team participating in football in Meghalaya, giving suitable justifications. •• Your physical education teacher must be planning events for sports day. Note down the diets he or she suggests to you. Relate all in terms of food groups and give your suggestions in terms of suitability to the game you are playing. Reprint 2025-26"}

At the same time high protein intake particularly from animal foods or protein powders or supplements may cause unnecessary weight gain, calcium excretion in urine and adverse effect on bones, liver and kidney functions. Consumption of more protein is advisable after the event, during rest period for repair and recovery of the body. Fat Fat is not considered a good source of energy during exercise and competition. It is metabolised very slowly, thus, is better for slow and long duration events like marathon. Fats like butter, cream, cow’s ghee or coconut oil are good for synthesis of hormone necessary to maintain stamina in sport. Nuts, seeds, low fat dairy products are good choices as they also provide other nutrients and antioxidants. Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids like flax seeds, fish oil, salmon, consumed in the right amount, enhance strength and vigour in the body and accelerate performance. However, high intake of fat eventually leads to overweight, obesity and associated health problems which hamper performance significantly. Vitamins and minerals Vitamins and minerals are crucial in sport because energy utilisation in the body is largely associated with them, particularly some group B vitamins and magnesium. Folate, calcium, zinc, iron are other crucial micronutrients which get depleted faster during long exercises. Vitamin C plays an important role in collagen synthesis and absorption and utilisation of iron in the body. Vitamin B6 helps in protein utilisation. Vitamin A, E and C are important to prevent cell damage and act as antioxidants which are needed to reduce stress and improve stamina and immunity. Adequate intake of these supports the performance and recovery from injury in sport. Colorful fruits and vegetables, dairy products, seeds, nuts and whole grains taken in sufficient amount can provide the needed vitamins and minerals. Water and fluids Water and fluids maintain the hydration level and electrolyte balance in the body and are crucial in sports. Dehydration can be serious and can lead to heat exhaustion, profuse sweating, muscle cramps, vertigo (fainting), vomiting, constipation, excessive fatigue and disturbance in vision and coordination. It can hamper the performance and reduce endurance significantly. Drinking 2-2.5 liters of water may be adequate but up to 5-6 liters a day in hot weather and intense exercises may be needed. Sometimes just potable water is not sufficient addition of glucose and salt is also needed. Reprint 2025-26"}

Food Quality Nutritious food too, if contaminated or adulterated is not safe for consumption as it may cause infection or disease. Hence the causes of food spoilage, and the ways to improve the food quality need to be understood. Food quality is the criteria by which a person accepts or rejects any food item. It is crucial at every stage of food handling from farm to table. Good quality food brings health and well-being and poor quality can cause illness and rejection of food in the market as well. Quality of food is often judged in terms of microbiological load and alterations in physical parameters and chemical composition of food. Food quality risks include food adulteration. In order to protect the health of the people every government enforces certain laws and regulations. In India it is the responsibility of Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) to ensure safety and quality food. Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is a statuary body under Food Safety and Standards Act 2006. It now encompasses previously employed eight acts in the interest of food operators and consumers. It ensures the availability of wholesome food that is safe for consumption. Amendment and up-gradation are done from time to time. FSSAI code is given to each food item which you can see on various food products. Physical examination of food is done on the basis of size, shape, color, texture and visual appeal. The food should be free from dirt, cracks or any foreign material; contamination by bacteria, mould, virus, yeast; and infestation by insects, pests, rats, mice, flies and cockroaches which lead to food spoilage and make the food unfit for human consumption. Food quality can seriously be influenced by factors like heat (temperature); air (oxygen, humidity) or moisture content of food, type of food itself and its composition, treatment given to food during processing, handling and storage. Food quality is favorably altered by techniques of food preservation. It is also possible to enhance nutritional quality of food by fortification. Activity 9.4 •• Visit to nearby market, select any 10 food items and report food quality based on the check points above. •• Collect 10 packaged foods and record five points reflecting the food quality in each. •• If you have found low quality food then what you would do?

When food quality is modified intentionally, it is called food adulteration. Over ripening or excessive microbial load causes food spoilage. All these aspects are discussed briefly in the following section. Check points to ensure food quality •• Check for cuts, bruises, foul smell, discoloration and wrinkles on fruits and vegetables before purchase, handling and consumption. •• Check for any foreign material or adulterant in food. •• Check for seal of the packet or lid of the container or bulging of container. •• Read label for safety, permitted color, preservatives, in- gredients, specific information, direction of use, FSSAI code, manufacturing and expiry or “best before” date. •• Avoid buying loose food items particularly flours, oil, spice powders, etc. •• Be watchful for harmful chemicals and colors used to give product a certain look, e.g., acid washed ginger and colored sweets. Food spoilage Food spoilage indicates that the food is unfit for human consumption. It is a serious threat to food quality and can be fatal. It is mainly caused by microorganisms, over activity of some enzymes and insects, pests and rodents. High moisture content, temperature and nutrient composition of food affects the growth of causative factors and accelerate food spoilage. The knowledge of approximate shelf life of different foods helps in reducing spoilage. The duration of time during which the food item remains fit for consumption at room temperature is called shelf life which determines perishability. Thus, foods are — 1. Perishable which remain fresh and edible for few hours to 1-2 days only, e.g., milk, meat, green leafy vegetables. 2. Semi-perishable which remain fresh and edible for about a week (5-7 days) e.g., some vegetables and fruits. 3. Non-perishable which remain fresh and edible for more than a month, e.g., grains, sugar, oil, pulses. Food is precious and is not available in unlimited quantity. So food should not be wasted rather protected from spoilage. Proper storage of food decreases food spoilage and various Fig. 9.5: ISI Activity 9.5 •• Collect five perishable food items and leave them at room temperature.

Food preservation Food preservation is the process of treating and handling food to stop or slow down spoilage and extend shelf life of food. It works on the principles of reducing the moisture content, preventing the growth of micro organisms causing spoilage and controlling enzymatic activity. The techniques are — 1. Heat treatment: Application of heat helps in preserving food by destroying the harmful microorganisms. For example, Pasteurisation of milk and sterilisation of bottles. 2. Refrigeration and freezing: Low temperature limit the enzymatic and microbial activities keeping the food safe for longer duration. 3. Drying or dehydration: This technique is based on reducing or removing the moisture content of food as microbes cannot grow in the absence of water. 4. Addition of preservatives: Preservatives are natural or chemical ingredients which selectively control the growth of microorganisms and enzymes in food and restrict spoilage. Jams and jellies are preserved by sugar and pickles by salt, spices and oil. Acid medium also restrict the growth of bacteria. Chemical preservatives like sodium benzoate or Potassium Meta bisulphite (KMS) are used in ketchups and squashes. Preservatives are used in very small quantity. Use above the prescribed limit is harmful and punishable under law. 5. Preservation by Radiation: Radiations are emissions of intense energy capable of penetrating tissues. When food is exposed to specific form of radiation (gamma rays from Cobalt 60) under controlled conditions it increases their shelf life and is referred as irradiated food. Items like fruits, potatoes, onions, spices, herbs and some ready-to-eat foods can be preserved in this way. But this technique is not suitable for milk and milk products. The safety of irradiated foods is under debate. Consumers can choose or avoid irradiated foods by identifying its symbol on the label. This mark has been approved by Food safety and Standards Regulations Authority of India (2015).

As a part of its mandate to ensure safe food to the citizens, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) conducts testing of food for different types of adulterants, chemical and micro-biological contaminants and other safety parameters for food. The food testing is done by FSSAI through a network of FSSAI notified laboratories across the country. The food safety officers collect samples of food products for testing. A consumer can also get the samples of food tested in such labs. If the food is found unsafe after testing, the cost of the test is reimbursed to the consumer. Adverse effects of food adulteration on health Adulteration is detrimental to health. Many a times food is adulterated in such a way that it looks the same but soon it may change in taste, appearance and nutritional composition, often leading to harmful effects on health. Consuming adulterated food can cause the symptoms like diarrhea, vomiting, headache, abdominal cramps, fatigue, etc. Sometimes its impact may not be instantly visible but may distort the functioning of the immune, digestive and nervous system.

Effects of pesticides on health Pesticides are chemicals used in agriculture to protect crops in the fields, during storage and to control insects and pests in the surroundings, e.g., mosquitoes and cockroaches. These can be chemical or biological in nature. Chemical pesticides have played a significant role in increasing food production, but unnecessary and excessive use of these over a long period of time has adversely influenced various forms of life on earth, as well as, the quality of soil, water and environment. These have disrupted the natural balance of the ecosystem. Pesticides often leave their residues in food which are passed on to the body. Those at higher risks are workers handling or producing pesticides as pesticides are toxic in nature. The adverse effects of pesticide residues depend on the type and amount of the pesticide and the route (ingestion or inhalation) and duration of exposure. If pesticide is used in accordance with good agricultural practice, the residual level would be low and consumption of such foods will not be harmful. Symptoms of acute poisoning include vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dizziness and numbness. In severe cases, it may lead to difficulties in breathing, blurred vision and convulsion. Pesticides can cause damage to the brain and nervous system, liver, kidneys and are specially harmful to fetus. In India, FSSAI is responsible for setting maximum residue limits (MRLs) for the pesticides.

Many substances have been used as medicines since ages in one or the other form, but modern times have seen a tremendous growth in terms of types and usage of medicines. While medicines are used to treat diseases and can be life saving, they can harm the body if not used correctly. Medicines are used in the form of injections, tablets, syrups, creams, lotions, solutions, drops, powder, sprays and straps. Medicines affect us in many ways. Some of the common ways are — •• Analgesics — reducing pain and in fever. •• Antibodies — killing or weakening microbes and infections. •• Lotions — in burns and allergies, for soothing effect. •• Supplements — correcting deficiencies due to vitamins, nutrients. •• Antipsychotic drugs — modifying the body’s response, psychological disorders. •• Vaccines and inoculations and immunisation — Protecting and preventing. •• Hormones — supporting physiological functions. •• Herbal medicines — plants herbs Although medicines assist us to lead a healthy life free of diseases, there are also certain undesirable effects due to Do You Know? 30 compressions followed by two breaths counts consists of one cycle of CPR.

Also they are more amenable to external influences, such as, the media and peers. This makes them more vulnerable to substance misuse, especially when they do not have correct and scientific information.

As you have learnt, drugs affect the body by changing the mental and physical status of a person. Some other substances also work in the same way and are not necessarily drugs. The non-medical use of a substance including drugs, that changes an individual’s mental and physical status and affect the health adversely, is known as substance abuse. Once a person starts using a substance, his mental state is altered and the person cannot get out of this habit. The extreme dependency on the substance compels them to increase the intake every day. This is called addiction. Substance misuse is widespread today including adolescents across the world. Socially acceptable drugs like tobacco and alcohol abuse not only ruins the life of the individual but can also influence them to associated with crime and violence. Commonly abused substances There are substances that can be abused for their mood- altering effects such as inhalants and solvents. On the other hand, there are drugs that can be abused that have no mood- altering or intoxication properties, such as, anabolic steroids. They are abused by the adolescents and youth during body building, to look more muscular. Commonly abused substances are tobacco, alcohol, marijuana (ganja), opium, cannabis, solvents (petrol, glue, correction ink) and aerosols inhalants, cough syrup, caffeine, cocaine and ecstasy. There are other substances like gutka and paan (betel). These substances can be ingested, inhaled, drunk, chewed or injected by a syringe in the blood. Some of these substances make one addicted, even if taken once. Reasons for substance abuse in young people Young people are more vulnerable to substance abuse due to the following reasons — •• During the process of growing up, poor self-esteem, low achievement at school, performance pressures, etc,. are some of the factors that promote substance abuse in adolescence. Resorting to substance use as a means of ‘growing up’ or fun also makes the adolescents more vulnerable to substance abuse. •• Pressure from peers or friends to try an addictive substance, the urge to gain popularity among friends, and desire to experiment and curiosity to try out new things also make young people particularly vulnerable to substance abuse.

CASE 1 Sohan has performed well in Class IX annual exams. Now, he is worried whether he will be able to keep up his performance and score good grades in Class X. His parents always tell him how they expect to see him at the top of his class. Afraid of disappointing them, Sohan does not share his concerns with his parents. He feels that some of his friends may be going through the same phase and discusses his problem with them. His friends suggest that smoking may reduce his stress and help him to relax. Sohan wants to feel better and decides to follow his friends’ advice. He starts smoking a cigarette or two everyday. Without realising, over a period of six months he was smoking 6-10 cigarettes a day. Smoking has become a habit with him, and in future, it was the cause of his ill health. Points for Discussion a) What do you think is responsible for Sohan’s habit of smoking and why? b) Do you think smoking helped reduce Sohan’s stress? Why? c) What else could Sohan have done to reduce his stress effectively? d) What role could Sohan’s parents have played to prevent him from smoking? Consequences of substance abuse Substance misuse leads to a number of short-term and long- term effects that are detrimental to health. Short-term effects: These are effects that appear only a few minutes after the intake of substance. The user feels a false sense of well-being and a pleasant drowsiness. Some of the short-term effects are distorted vision, hearing and coordination, impaired judgment, bad breath and hangovers. Reprint 2025-26"}

These effects show up over a course of time and are usually caused by progressive damage to different body organs. Some of the health consequences include irregular eating habits, sleep disorders, poor hygiene resulting in poor health and low immunity. This predisposes substance abuser to diseases and infections. Substance abuse in itself is not a cause of HIV/AIDS or STDs but under the influence of drugs, people may engage in risk-behaviours that make them more susceptible to these infections. Injectable drug users, however, are more prone to HIV in conditions where the users do not sterilise needles and share needles to inject the drug. Substance users may even die suddenly from a so-called overdose, when one consumes more than what the body can tolerate. Death may also occur from long-term damage to the organs of the body. These substances are especially harmful if consumed during pregnancy. These substances reach the foetus through blood and harm it by crippling its growth and development or death. Substance abuse influences not only the individual and family but also the community. The persons who get addicted often lose interest in other activities be it school, job or any other responsibility. They are not able to take care of their responsibilities and may become a liability for their families and finally the society. Furthermore, it is expensive to buy substances or drugs on a regular basis. Hence, in desperation, addicted individuals may be forced to engage in petty severe crimes. Prevention of drug abuse Paying attention to the following may prevent young people from misusing substances — •• Peer pressure can be managed by being aware of the implications of substance abuse and developing life skills. One can not only save oneself from adopting risky behaviours under peer pressure but also persuade the peers not to engage in unhealthy behaviours such as substance misuse. Advocacy with the involvement of local community can be quite useful. • • The different ways of dealing with negative peer pressure are saying ‘No’ assertively, making an excuse, reversal of pressure, and giving reasons. • • Young people should also be educated to recognise that a friend is someone who cares, protects and looks Activity 10.6 Discuss how a substance abuser’s life gets affected.

The family, community and educational institutions should empower young people with correct and scientific information. Young children should be encouraged to get engaged in socially productive activities. For example, one can start a learning centre for the lesser advantaged children in the neighbourhood, one can learn Braille and help at blind school, and one can create awareness about water conservation in the neighbourhood.

Our socio-economic needs are such that people depend upon each other as we cannot live in isolation. We live together and collectively share certain amenities that are necessary for our day-to-day existence. In the previous classes (Class VII to IX), we read about the negative effects of unhygienic or filthy surroundings on our health. Regular access to basic amenities, such as, clean water, sanitation, garbage disposal facilities, health care services, recreational facilities, etc., are important for prevention of illnesses and diseases. For prevention of diseases like coronavirus, maintaining of social distance is very important. In this chapter, the essential features of healthy community living including social distancing during coronavirus will be discussed. The focus will also be on the principles of cooperative living to ensure healthy living conditions for one and all. Healthy Community Living Our way of life, and the utilisation of resources, decide the quality of our personal and community life. A healthy way of living in the community is ensured not only by the optimal use of resources but also by keeping our environment clean and hygienic.

As per the Census of 2011, the total population of Mawlynnong is 414. The main occupation of the villagers is agriculture, but it has also been an age old tradition of ensuring that the surrounding environment is clean. In fact cleanliness is a collective effort and this practice is ingrained in the people since their childhood. The people voluntarily sweep the roads and lanes, water the plants in public areas and clean the drains. A dustbin made out of bamboo is found all along the village. Everyone makes it a point that dirt and waste are not thrown anywhere. All the waste from the dustbin is collected and kept in a pit, which the villagers use as manure. Trees are planted to restore and maintain nature’s balance. Mawlynnong’s fame as the cleanest village in Asia, is drawing a lot of domestic as well as international tourists, as a result of which tourism is also an important source of employment for the local youths. Besides, there are many interesting sights to see such as the famous living root bridge in the nearby village of Riwai, which is a fascinating example of indigenous methods of conservation and sustainability.

Through these activities, you may have observed that in a community, a group of people live in a particular local area. Secondly, they share common facilities, which differ from place to place. In some areas, people have access to facilities, such as, water supply, sanitation, garbage disposal facilities, health care services, recreational facilities, community centre, schools, transportation, etc., but in some places people do not have access to even the most basic amenities. A community is said to be healthy when its members continuously work together to maintain, improve and expand the available natural resources and avoid their wastage. The healthy community only be develped when its members recognise their roles and responsibilities. They strive to inculcate values and attitudes of cooperation, mutual respect, tolerance, kindness, etc. The role of Panchayati Raj, civil societies and other government institutions is also very important to promote healthy living. Important features of healthy community living Maintaining cleanliness of our home and surroundings is an essential feature of healthy community living. Healthy community is one in which all residents have access to quality education, safe and healthy homes, adequate employment, transportation, physical activity and nutrition. Living in overcrowded and unhygienic places with excessive noise and pollution, may lead to various forms of illnesses, diseases and stress. For instance, lack of adequate space, poor ventilation in rooms and toxic fumes in the air, increase the risk of air borne diseases. Access to basic amenities such as regular water supply, safe drinking water and sanitation, is important for healthy community living. In the previous classes (Classes VII to IX), it has been learnt that open and unattended garbage dumps are a potential breeding place for flies, cockroaches, insects and so on. Stagnant water and open drains breed mosquitoes, the carrier of diseases, such as, malaria, dengue and chikungunya. Water borne diseases, such as, cholera, jaundice, diarrhea and gastroenteritis are also resulted due to water pollution. Access to basic amenities also includes other provisions such as electricity, hospitals, dispensaries, housing facilities, roads and transportation, schools, colleges, employment, security, recreational facilities and so on.

They are required to ensure rules and regulations for safety measures, cleanliness, ensure equal access of public amenities to all members, promote adoption of waste management practices, and help ecological restoration and conservation. However, we cannot depend solely on the government to take the initiative. The quality of life in a community also depends on how the members of the community work to improve on available resources and ensure that the government provides for these facilities. You might have seen this logo before. This is the logo of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. You must have also seen some of the television advertisements through which the government advertises the importance and necessity of staying clean and keeping our environment clean. In this Clean India campaign — known popularly as the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the vision of a Clean and hygienic India, once seen by Mahatma Gandhi, can happen only if members of every community cooperate and accept individual and collective responsibility of keeping themselves, their homes and their surroundings clean. In order to work collectively, members of a community need to develop values of co-operation, kindness, respect, gratitude, joy, peace and selflessness. These attributes are important in fostering the principles of collective work and in nurturing healthy social relationships. The example of Mawlynnong village shows that high income alone is not the only criterion for healthy living. Cooperative action, responsibility and positive values can also help in improving the quality of life, and healthy living conditions for one and all.

Camping is an outdoor activity, where familiar surroundings are left to spend a night or several nights at an outdoor site. The location of these sites varies as per the objectives of the trip, time of the year and budget available. Common camping sites are: visits to villages or rural areas to understand their pattern of living; mountain areas, national parks, lakes, beaches, forests, etc. One can also plan camping activities in a nearby place, such as, open fields, park, or even in an open space of the school premises.

Importance of camping Camping gives students a good break, away from the monotony of the classroom. It gives an opportunity to learn from nature in a joyful, exciting and adventurous manner. Living in the natural environment with students from different areas, cultures, religions and backgrounds, help then to learn to work as a team in various activities. These activities differ from adventurous and challenging ones, to the most basic ones, such as, cooking, cleaning, collecting water, etc. In this process, students learn the importance of self-reliance, teamwork, co-existence, importance of natural resources and organisational skills.

Humans too are social animals and much of their behaviour is based on social norms laid down by the human societies since time immemorial. Therefore, social health is a very important issue for all human beings — men-women, young-old, educated- uneducated, rich-poor. Those children who learn to become socially healthy remain so all their lives. This chapter, will deal with the ways and means of growing up as socially healthy individuals and also helping them to clarify myths related to coronavirus. Myths and facts related to coronavirus Statement: A person with coronavirus can recover fully and not be infectious any longer. Fact: 80 per cent of the people have recovered from the disease without needing special treatment. But information on the virus treatment is still being researched. Statement: Eating raw garlic, sesame seeds will protect you against the virus. Fact: Garlic is a healthy food that has other benefits but does not protect you against the coronavirus. Statement: The virus can die easily once it is out of the body. Fact: We do not know about this particular virus as of now. Similar viruses (SARS, MERS) survive from 8 to 24 hours depending on types of surfaces. Statement: You can get COVID-19 through mosquito bites Fact: The coronavirus cannot be spread through the bite of a mosquito.

Activity 12.1 Read the following conversation between an old grandfather, Mr. Das and 12-year-old grandson’s friend Ravi. Mr. Das : How are you Ravi and how is your grandfather? Ravi : I am fine but my grandfather always feels angry and unhappy. He criticises everyone all the time, so no one wants to sit and talk with him. He is boring and not as loving as you are. Why does he behave like that Dadu? Mr. Das : It is because he has been unwell for a long time. Your grandpa is not getting company from any one, this makes him feel lonely and isolated. In other words, he is suffering physically, as well as mentally due to his old age. He gets angry because he is unsure of himself now and annoys others by his comments. He does not think that he is acceptable in society now. Which is why, he expresses his frustrations by being rude to others without any reason and fault of theirs. Why don’t you spend time with him? Talk to him about your friends, your day in school, a happy incident, a sad one also and you may observe the change in him within a few days. Ravi : Thank you, Dadu. Now I understand that if someone is sick and emotionally unhappy, he would likely be angry and alienate others. Answer in brief 1. Give reasons for the loneliness of Ravi’s grandfather. 2. State situations that made Ravi think his grandfather was alienating others. 3. Say yes or no (a) Do you agree that physical, mental and social health are interrelated?

Would you agree that the country’s constitution provides for Justice, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity which should be adopted in life for living happily and having consideration for all others in the group? Let us understand these four terms of our constitution which are directly related to “social health of a person or a country”, and then try to define social health. In other words, if one is socially healthy, than will be able to develop interpersonal relations, through maintaining equality, fraternity and justice. Let us now try and define social health. Definition of ‘Social Health’ Social health may be defined as the ability to form satisfying interpersonal relationships with others. One who is able to make positive relationships and acquires the ability to adapt in different social situations and act appropriately as per the situation concerned, and can be called a socially healthy person. Need for developing social health Primitive humans were hunter-gatherers, who lived in small groups or clusters and spent their lives at individual levels. Around 10,000 years ago, they moved near rivers to grow their own food and began to live together. With the passage of time, they started to live in a society and developed a language for interaction with each other. As ‘human society’ progressed, an individual became part of many social groups for example a member of a peer group, a family and kin, a class in school, a native of a region and a citizen of one’s country. Social changes occur from time to time and many societies lay down norms and values for group living. Urbanisation has brought about many changes which are different from traditional rural societies. Social attributes, of people however, remain the same as they are based on interrelationship between members of any society and necessary for accomplishing tasks requiring teamwork. School is one of the platforms for learning social skills. Role of various Institutions Promotion of social health among children requires collective efforts and appropriate skills. All people in the field of education have to think about this. Reprint 2025-26"}

There are a number of organisation concerned with school education. The syllabus of teacher training courses should include the topics of important issues for children of which health should be one. Organisations such as NCERT, SCERT, DIET should periodically organise workshops, publish journals and provide inservice training programmes on health issues including social health. Role of schools in promoting social health Schools have a very significant role to play in the promotion of health and safety of children. They spend a lot of time in school in early years. School environment forms ideal setting for acquiring knowledge of healthy choices of food. It is in school that they participate in physical activity through sports, games, yoga, gymnastics, exercise and gain benefits of each. School helps children to learn social skills which assist in establishing lifelong healthy behavior. Children learn team spirit and training in rules and regulations of social wellbeing just as in the defense services, which are inbuilt in training of defense service personnel, so they work together as a team to protect our nation. In order to promote social health, the school should have a positive environment where children mingle with teachers, peer group and non-teaching staff without fear and apprehensions. Teacher have a significant role in this regard. Role of teachers It is well known that teachers are the mentors and therefore, the teacher training institutes should make training in leadership and mentorship a part of teacher training. Also well known saying that ‘example in better than precept’ Students easily learn to be socially healthy if the teacher herself or himself sets an example rather than lecture on social health. A good teacher ensures that students grow up into physically, mentally and socially healthy individuals. In doing this the teacher has to make efforts to ensure that students — (i) eat a proper diet and perform regular exercise and physical activity which are requirements of good physical health. (ii) inculcate friendship between classmates, indulge in amicable behavior with others in school so that students develop a helpful nature. These are necessary for mental and emotional health.

Teachers should train students in learning life skills like — a) empathy and self awareness b) effective communication so that they develop healthy Interpersonal relationships c) problem-solving and decision-making to learn to be stress free d) creative and critical thinking e) coping with stress and emotion. The above are absolutely essential for developing social skills in order to be socially healthy. Social skills help a student to have a desirable self image and self esteem and also self confidence. This makes children acquire ability to live harmoniously in the society. Role of technology in building social health Technology has made communication convenient through Mobiles, Skype, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and E-mail messages. Knowledge about different media can help to develop the skills to access the appropriate media for accurate information on a specific topic or issues. More so, because media brings awareness, and provides access to global knowledge and learning. But refrain from using mobiles and viewing the T.V. for long periods as that tends to be counter-productive and reduce interaction time with others. This makes us socially withdrawn. Although media is a source of information, all of it may not be true or reliable. It is advisable to seek guidenes from a trusted adult while accessing media and internet. Moreover, there is a need to understand about real and fake news or information as these affects our attitude and behavior. Role of students in building habits of social health Social health comes from social skills. A few important guidelines for promoting social skills are outlined below. (i) Building self awareness is an important skill: Practice self-care by developing habits of cleanliness and hygiene, keeping away from substance abuse, engaging in physical activity and regularly consuming a balanced diet. (ii) Do not be blameful and judgmental: Remember when you point a finger at others, three fingers of yours point towards you. Hence indulge in knowing yourself better. It helps to discriminate between a good and a bad act of yours and helps to make friends. Empathy and self awareness go hand in hand.

That is empathy for others and leads to self awareness. (iii) Learn to identify your own mistakes: There is no harm in saying sorry for a mistake and rectifying it. People will have faith in you if you did so. (iv) Make an effort to reconnect with old relationships and friendships: The socially healthy person makes an effort to contact and meet old friends, to remember enjoyable periods of childhood which can be a good way to beat stress and spend leisure time. (v) Appreciate yourself and others: But never let your ego rule your behaviour which can sometimes drive you to lose a relationship. (vi) Try and be respectful, positive and supportive towards the needy, the physically and mentally challenged, the downtrodden and those belonging to faith and cultures other than yours. Lend an ear to others opinion. It teaches tolerance. Tolerance and appreciation are virtues in socially healthy individuals. Role of family in inculcating social skills in young family members The importance of family in inculcating social skills among, children is paramount. Guardians or parents are the prime teachers and caretakers who feed them healthy food and are also their play mates. They have to be aware themselves to be role model and make children appreciate as they grow. The benefits of enjoying nutritious food and being aware of a balanced diet is of paramount importance. Watching of television for longer duration is bad for students. Parents themselves have to be cautious in what they do in front of children and how long they are in front of the TV. However, at the same time good TV programmes are an avenue for learning. Encourage them to indulge in physical activity to build their muscles and bones. Fit body and fitness depends primarily on proper diet and healthy body and mind. The parents and elder family members need to guide them in social skills. Parents and elders have to be accessible to children for necessary guidance. They form a “safety network’. They are to guide adolescents through advice, answer their queries and occupy them through activities to keep them away from involvement in addictive substances like tobacco, drugs and alcohol which they might believe are helpful in tiding over stress. However, these substances have deleterious effects on the growing body. Reprint 2025-26"}

The teacher needs to play an active role in discouraging her students from engaging in socially unhealthy practices such as vindictive attitudes, selfishness, jealousy and culture of hatred. For this, teacher has to sacrifice time and energy. It is however, necessary for a teacher and school authorities to understand that more than finishing the syllabus and passing exams, it is the teacher’s responsibility to build good human beings. Home has a large role to play but it has been the mission of teachers to contribute towards grooming students into socially healthy adults 2. Another role of a teacher in inculcating ‘social health’ is to have a friendly, stress-free atmosphere in class. This can happen if students are engaged in ‘group activities’, especially activities for ‘experiential learning’. Members of groups are reshuffled from time to time for team activities so that students may understand that it takes all kinds of people to make the world and the socially healthy groups can live in harmony despite differing in opinions.

There is a State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) in almost all the major States. This institution is responsible for preparation of syllabi and textbooks for all the classes at primary and upper primary stages.
