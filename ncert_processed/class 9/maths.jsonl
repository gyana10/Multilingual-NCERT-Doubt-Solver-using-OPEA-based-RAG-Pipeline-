This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the national Policy on Education (1986). The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognize that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge. This aims imply considerable change is school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather then a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience. The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in science and mathematics, Professor J.V. Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor P. Sinclair of IGNOU, New Delhi for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed Reprint 2025-26"}

Now turn and walk all the way back, pick up zero and put it into the bag. You now have the collection of whole numbers which is denoted by the symbol W. Now, stretching in front of you are many, many negative integers. Put all the negative integers into your bag. What is your new collection? Recall that it is the collection of all integers, and it is denoted by the symbol Z. Are there some numbers still left on the line? Of course! There are numbers like 1 3 , 2 4 , or even 2005 2006 − .

The collection of rational numbers is denoted by Q. ‘Rational’ comes from the word ‘ratio’, and Q comes from the word ‘quotient’. You may recall the definition of rational numbers: A number ‘r’ is called a rational number, if it can be written in the form p q , where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0. (Why do we insist that q ≠ 0?) Notice that all the numbers now in the bag can be written in the form p q , where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0. For example, –25 can be written as 25; 1 − here p = –25 and q = 1. Therefore, the rational numbers also include the natural numbers, whole numbers and integers. You also know that the rational numbers do not have a unique representation in the form p q , where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0. For example, 1 2 = 2 4 = 10 20 = 25 50 = 47 94 , and so on. These are equivalent rational numbers (or fractions). However, when we say that p q is a rational number, or when we represent p q on the number line, we assume that q ≠ 0 and that p and q have no common factors other than 1 (that is, p and q are co-prime). So, on the number line, among the infinitely many fractions equivalent to 1 2 , we will choose 1 2 to represent all of them. Now, let us solve some examples about the different types of numbers, which you have studied in earlier classes. Example 1 : Are the following statements true or false? Give reasons for your answers. (i) Every whole number is a natural number. (ii) Every integer is a rational number. (iii) Every rational number is an integer. Solution : (i) False, because zero is a whole number but not a natural number. (ii) True, because every integer m can be expressed in the form 1 m , and so it is a rational number. Reprint 2025-26"}
{"class": "class 9", "subject": "maths", "page_no": 16, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "4 MATHEMATICS (iii) False, because 3 5 is not an integer. Example 2 : Find five rational numbers between 1 and 2. We can approach this problem in at least two ways. Solution 1 : Recall that to find a rational number between r and s, you can add r and s and divide the sum by 2, that is 2 r s + lies between r and s. So, 3 2 is a number between 1 and 2. You can proceed in this manner to find four more rational numbers between 1 and 2. These four numbers are 5 11 13 7. , , and 4 8 8 4 Solution 2 : The other option is to find all the five rational numbers in one step. Since we want five numbers, we write 1 and 2 as rational numbers with denominator 5 + 1, i.e., 1 = 6 6 and 2 = 12 6 . Then you can check that 7 6 , 8 6 , 9 6 , 10 6 and 11 6 are all rational numbers between 1 and 2. So, the five numbers are 7 4 3 5 11 , , , and 6 3 2 3 6 . Remark : Notice that in Example 2, you were asked to find five rational numbers between 1 and 2. But, you must have realised that in fact there are infinitely many rational numbers between 1 and 2. In general, there are infinitely many rational numbers between any two given rational numbers. Let us take a look at the number line again. Have you picked up all the numbers? Not, yet. The fact is that there are infinitely many more numbers left on the number line! There are gaps in between the places of the numbers you picked up, and not just one or two but infinitely many. The amazing thing is that there are infinitely many numbers lying between any two of these gaps too! So we are left with the following questions: 1. What are the numbers, that are left on the number line, called? 2. How do we recognise them? That is, how do we distinguish them from the rationals (rational numbers)? These questions will be answered in the next section. Reprint 2025-26"}

(iii) Every rational number is a whole number. 1.2 Irrational Numbers We saw, in the previous section, that there may be numbers on the number line that are not rationals. In this section, we are going to investigate these numbers. So far, all the numbers you have come across, are of the form p q , where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0. So, you may ask: are there numbers which are not of this form? There are indeed such numbers. The Pythagoreans in Greece, followers of the famous mathematician and philosopher Pythagoras, were the first to discover the numbers which were not rationals, around 400 BC. These numbers are called irrational numbers (irrationals), because they cannot be written in the form of a ratio of integers. There are many myths surrounding the discovery of irrational numbers by the Pythagorean, Hippacus of Croton. In all the myths, Hippacus has an unfortunate end, either for discovering that 2 is irrational or for disclosing the secret about 2 to people outside the secret Pythagorean sect! Let us formally define these numbers. A number ‘s’ is called irrational, if it cannot be written in the form p q , where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0.

It turns out that there are infinitely many irrational numbers too. Some examples are: 2, 3, 15, π, 0.10110111011110... Remark : Recall that when we use the symbol , we assume that it is the positive square root of the number. So 4 = 2, though both 2 and –2 are square roots of 4. Some of the irrational numbers listed above are familiar to you. For example, you have already come across many of the square roots listed above and the number π. The Pythagoreans proved that 2 is irrational. Later in approximately 425 BC, Theodorus of Cyrene showed that 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 17 are also irrationals. Proofs of irrationality of 2 , 3 , 5 , etc., shall be discussed in Class X. As to π, it was known to various cultures for thousands of years, it was proved to be irrational by Lambert and Legendre only in the late 1700s. In the next section, we will discuss why 0.10110111011110... and π are irrational. Let us return to the questions raised at the end of the previous section. Remember the bag of rational numbers. If we now put all irrational numbers into the bag, will there be any number left on the number line? The answer is no! It turns out that the collection of all rational numbers and irrational numbers together make up what we call the collection of real numbers, which is denoted by R. Therefore, a real number is either rational or irrational. So, we can say that every real number is represented by a unique point on the number line. Also, every point on the number line represents a unique real number. This is why we call the number line, the real number line. In the 1870s two German mathematicians, Cantor and Dedekind, showed that : Corresponding to every real number, there is a point on the real number line, and corresponding to every point on the number line, there exists a unique real number.

We will look at the decimal expansions of real numbers and see if we can use the expansions to distinguish between rationals and irrationals. We will also explain how to visualise the representation of real numbers on the number line using their decimal expansions. Since rationals are more familiar to us, let us start with them.

You should have noticed at least three things: (i) The remainders either become 0 after a certain stage, or start repeating themselves. (ii) The number of entries in the repeating string of remainders is less than the divisor (in 10 3 one number repeats itself and the divisor is 3, in 1 7 there are six entries 326451 in the repeating string of remainders and 7 is the divisor). (iii) If the remainders repeat, then we get a repeating block of digits in the quotient (for 10 3 , 3 repeats in the quotient and for 1 7 , we get the repeating block 142857 in the quotient).

{"class": "class 9", "subject": "maths", "page_no": 22, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "10 MATHEMATICS Although we have noticed this pattern using only the examples above, it is true for all rationals of the form p q (q ≠ 0). On division of p by q, two main things happen – either the remainder becomes zero or never becomes zero and we get a repeating string of remainders. Let us look at each case separately. Case (i) : The remainder becomes zero In the example of 7 8 , we found that the remainder becomes zero after some steps and the decimal expansion of 7 8 = 0.875. Other examples are 1 2 = 0.5, 639 250 = 2.556. In all these cases, the decimal expansion terminates or ends after a finite number of steps. We call the decimal expansion of such numbers terminating. Case (ii) : The remainder never becomes zero In the examples of 10 3 and 1 7 , we notice that the remainders repeat after a certain stage forcing the decimal expansion to go on for ever. In other words, we have a repeating block of digits in the quotient. We say that this expansion is non-terminating recurring. For example, 10 3 = 3.3333... and 1 7 = 0.142857142857142857... The usual way of showing that 3 repeats in the quotient of 10 3 is to write it as 3.3. Similarly, since the block of digits 142857 repeats in the quotient of 1 7 , we write 1 7 as 0.142857 , where the bar above the digits indicates the block of digits that repeats. Also 3.57272... can be written as 3.572 . So, all these examples give us non-terminating recurring (repeating) decimal expansions. Thus, we see that the decimal expansion of rational numbers have only two choices: either they are terminating or non-terminating recurring. Now suppose, on the other hand, on your walk on the number line, you come across a number like 3.142678 whose decimal expansion is terminating or a number like 1.272727... that is, 1.27 , whose decimal expansion is non-terminating recurring, can you conclude that it is a rational number?

Solution : We have 3.142678 = 3142678 1000000 , and hence is a rational number. Now, let us consider the case when the decimal expansion is non-terminating recurring. Example 7 : Show that 0.3333... = 03. can be expressed in the form p q , where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0. Solution : Since we do not know what 03. is , let us call it ‘x’ and so x = 0.3333...

So, every number with a non-terminating recurring decimal expansion can be expressed in the form p q (q ≠ 0), where p and q are integers. Let us summarise our results in the following form : The decimal expansion of a rational number is either terminating or non- terminating recurring. Moreover, a number whose decimal expansion is terminating or non-terminating recurring is rational. So, now we know what the decimal expansion of a rational number can be. What about the decimal expansion of irrational numbers? Because of the property above, we can conclude that their decimal expansions are non-terminating non-recurring. So, the property for irrational numbers, similar to the property stated above for rational numbers, is The decimal expansion of an irrational number is non-terminating non-recurring.

(Note that, we often take 22 7 as an approximate value for π, but π ≠ 22 7 .) Over the years, mathematicians have developed various techniques to produce more and more digits in the decimal expansions of irrational numbers. For example, you might have learnt to find digits in the decimal expansion of 2 by the division method. Interestingly, in the Sulbasutras (rules of chord), a mathematical treatise of the Vedic period (800 BC - 500 BC), you find an approximation of 2 as follows: 2 = 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4142156 3 4 3 34 4 3 .     + + × − × × =         Notice that it is the same as the one given above for the first five decimal places. The history of the hunt for digits in the decimal expansion of π is very interesting. The Greek genius Archimedes was the first to compute digits in the decimal expansion of π. He showed 3.140845 < π < 3.142857. Aryabhatta (476 – 550 C.E.), the great Indian mathematician and astronomer, found the value of π correct to four decimal places (3.1416). Using high speed computers and advanced algorithms, π has been computed to over 1.24 trillion decimal places! Now, let us see how to obtain irrational numbers.

Moreover, if we add, subtract, multiply or divide (except by zero) two rational numbers, we still get a rational number (that is, rational numbers are ‘closed’ with respect to addition, subtraction, multiplication and division). It turns out that irrational numbers also satisfy the commutative, associative and distributive laws for addition and multiplication. However, the sum, difference, quotients and products of irrational numbers are not always irrational. For example, ( ) ( ) 6 6 + − ,( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 2 2 3 3 , − ⋅ and 17 17 are rationals. Let us look at what happens when we add and multiply a rational number with an irrational number. For example, 3 is irrational. What about 2 3 + and 2 3 ? Since 3 has a non-terminating non-recurring decimal expansion, the same is true for 2 3 + and 2 3 . Therefore, both 2 3 + and 2 3 are also irrational numbers. Example 11 : Check whether 7 5 , 7 2 21 2 5 , , + π − are irrational numbers or not. Solution : 5 = 2.236... , 2 = 1.4142..., π = 3.1415...

Now, let us see what generally happens if we add, subtract, multiply, divide, take square roots and even nth roots of these irrational numbers, where n is any natural number. Let us look at some examples. Example 12 : Add 2 2 5 3 + and 2 3 3 – . Solution : ( ) ( ) 2 2 5 3 2 3 3 – + + = ( ) ( ) 2 2 2 5 3 3 3 – + + = (2 + 1) 2 (5 3) 3 3 2 2 3 + − = + Reprint 2025-26"}

(ii) The product or quotient of a non-zero rational number with an irrational number is irrational. (iii) If we add, subtract, multiply or divide two irrationals, the result may be rational or irrational. We now turn our attention to the operation of taking square roots of real numbers. Recall that, if a is a natural number, then a b = means b2 = a and b > 0. The same definition can be extended for positive real numbers. Let a > 0 be a real number. Then a = b means b2 = a and b > 0. In Section 1.2, we saw how to represent n for any positive integer n on the number line. We now show how to find x for any given positive real number x geometrically. For example, let us find it for x = 3.5, i.e., we find 3 5. geometrically. Fig. 1.11 Mark the distance 3.5 units from a fixed point A on a given line to obtain a point B such that AB = 3.5 units (see Fig. 1.11). From B, mark a distance of 1 unit and mark the new point as C. Find the mid-point of AC and mark that point as O. Draw a semicircle with centre O and radius OC. Draw a line perpendicular to AC passing through B and intersecting the semicircle at D.

Then, as we have done for the case x = 3.5, we find BD = x (see Fig. 1.12). We can prove this result using the Pythagoras Theorem. Notice that, in Fig. 1.12, ∆ OBD is a right-angled triangle. Also, the radius of the circle is 1 2 x + units. Therefore, OC = OD = OA = 1 2 x + units.

You also have studied how to factorise some algebraic expressions. You may recall the algebraic identities : (x + y)2 = x2 + 2xy + y2 (x – y)2 = x2 – 2xy + y2 and x2 – y2 = (x + y) (x – y) and their use in factorisation. In this chapter, we shall start our study with a particular type of algebraic expression, called polynomial, and the terminology related to it. We shall also study the Remainder Theorem and Factor Theorem and their use in the factorisation of polynomials. In addition to the above, we shall study some more algebraic identities and their use in factorisation and in evaluating some given expressions. 2.2 Polynomials in One Variable Let us begin by recalling that a variable is denoted by a symbol that can take any real value. We use the letters x, y, z, etc. to denote variables. Notice that 2x, 3x, – x, – 1 2 x are algebraic expressions. All these expressions are of the form (a constant) × x. Now suppose we want to write an expression which is (a constant) × (a variable) and we do not know what the constant is. In such cases, we write the constant as a, b, c, etc. So the expression will be ax, say. However, there is a difference between a letter denoting a constant and a letter denoting a variable. The values of the constants remain the same throughout a particular situation, that is, the values of the constants do not change in a given problem, but the value of a variable can keep changing.

You know that the perimeter of a square is the sum of the lengths of its four sides. Here, each side is 3 units. So, its perimeter is 4 × 3, i.e., 12 units. What will be the perimeter if each side of the square is 10 units? The perimeter is 4 × 10, i.e., 40 units. In case the length of each side is x units (see Fig. 2.2), the perimeter is given by 4x units. So, as the length of the side varies, the perimeter varies. Can you find the area of the square PQRS? It is x × x = x2 square units. x2 is an algebraic expression. You are also familiar with other algebraic expressions like 2x, x2 + 2x, x3 – x2 + 4x + 7. Note that, all the algebraic expressions we have considered so far have only whole numbers as the exponents of the variable. Expressions of this form are called polynomials in one variable. In the examples above, the variable is x. For instance, x3 – x2 + 4x + 7 is a polynomial in x. Similarly, 3y2 + 5y is a polynomial in the variable y and t2 + 4 is a polynomial in the variable t. In the polynomial x2 + 2x, the expressions x2 and 2x are called the terms of the polynomial. Similarly, the polynomial 3y2 + 5y + 7 has three terms, namely, 3y2, 5y and 7. Can you write the terms of the polynomial –x3 + 4x2 + 7x – 2 ? This polynomial has 4 terms, namely, –x3, 4x2, 7x and –2. Each term of a polynomial has a coefficient. So, in –x3 + 4x2 + 7x – 2, the coefficient of x3 is –1, the coefficient of x2 is 4, the coefficient of x is 7 and –2 is the coefficient of x0 (Remember, x0 = 1). Do you know the coefficient of x in x2 – x + 7? It is –1. 2 is also a polynomial. In fact, 2, –5, 7, etc. are examples of constant polynomials. The constant polynomial 0 is called the zero polynomial. This plays a very important role in the collection of all polynomials, as you will see in the higher classes. Now, consider algebraic expressions such as x + 2 3 1 , 3 and . + + x y y x Do you know that you can write x + 1 x = x + x–1? Here, the exponent of the second term, i.e., x–1 is –1, which is not a whole number. So, this algebraic expression is not a polynomial. Again, 3 x + can be written as 1 2 3 x + . Here the exponent of x is 1 2 , which is not a whole number. So, is 3 x + a polynomial? No, it is not. What about 3 y + y2? It is also not a polynomial (Why?).

For instance, x150 + x149 + ... + x2 + x + 1 is a polynomial with 151 terms. Consider the polynomials 2x, 2, 5x3, –5x2, y and u4. Do you see that each of these polynomials has only one term? Polynomials having only one term are called monomials (‘mono’ means ‘one’). Now observe each of the following polynomials: p(x) = x + 1, q(x) = x2 – x, r(y) = y9 + 1, t(u) = u15 – u2 How many terms are there in each of these? Each of these polynomials has only two terms. Polynomials having only two terms are called binomials (‘bi’ means ‘two’). Similarly, polynomials having only three terms are called trinomials (‘tri’ means ‘three’). Some examples of trinomials are p(x) = x + x2 + π, q(x) = 2 + x – x2, r(u) = u + u2 – 2, t(y) = y4 + y + 5. Now, look at the polynomial p(x) = 3x7 – 4x6 + x + 9. What is the term with the highest power of x ? It is 3x7. The exponent of x in this term is 7. Similarly, in the polynomial q(y) = 5y6 – 4y2 – 6, the term with the highest power of y is 5y6 and the exponent of y in this term is 6. We call the highest power of the variable in a polynomial as the degree of the polynomial. So, the degree of the polynomial 3x7 – 4x6 + x + 9 is 7 and the degree of the polynomial 5y6 – 4y2 – 6 is 6. The degree of a non-zero constant polynomial is zero. Example 1 : Find the degree of each of the polynomials given below: (i) x5 – x4 + 3 (ii) 2 – y2 – y3 + 2y8 (iii) 2 Solution : (i) The highest power of the variable is 5. So, the degree of the polynomial is 5. (ii) The highest power of the variable is 8. So, the degree of the polynomial is 8. (iii) The only term here is 2 which can be written as 2x0. So the exponent of x is 0. Therefore, the degree of the polynomial is 0. Reprint 2025-26"}

Do you see anything common among all of them? The degree of each of these polynomials is one. A polynomial of degree one is called a linear polynomial. Some more linear polynomials in one variable are 2x – 1, 2 y + 1, 2 – u. Now, try and find a linear polynomial in x with 3 terms? You would not be able to find it because a linear polynomial in x can have at most two terms. So, any linear polynomial in x will be of the form ax + b, where a and b are constants and a ≠ 0 (why?). Similarly, ay + b is a linear polynomial in y. Now consider the polynomials : 2x2 + 5, 5x2 + 3x + π, x2 and x2 + 2 5 x Do you agree that they are all of degree two? A polynomial of degree two is called a quadratic polynomial. Some examples of a quadratic polynomial are 5 – y2, 4y + 5y2 and 6 – y – y2. Can you write a quadratic polynomial in one variable with four different terms? You will find that a quadratic polynomial in one variable will have at most 3 terms. If you list a few more quadratic polynomials, you will find that any quadratic polynomial in x is of the form ax2 + bx + c, where a ≠ 0 and a, b, c are constants. Similarly, quadratic polynomial in y will be of the form ay2 + by + c, provided a ≠ 0 and a, b, c are constants. We call a polynomial of degree three a cubic polynomial. Some examples of a cubic polynomial in x are 4x3, 2x3 + 1, 5x3 + x2, 6x3 – x, 6 – x3, 2x3 + 4x2 + 6x + 7. How many terms do you think a cubic polynomial in one variable can have? It can have at most 4 terms. These may be written in the form ax3 + bx2 + cx + d, where a ≠ 0 and a, b, c and d are constants. Now, that you have seen what a polynomial of degree 1, degree 2, or degree 3 looks like, can you write down a polynomial in one variable of degree n for any natural number n? A polynomial in one variable x of degree n is an expression of the form anxn + an–1xn–1 + . . . + a1x + a0 where a0, a1, a2, . . ., an are constants and an ≠ 0. In particular, if a0 = a1 = a2 = a3 = . . . = an = 0 (all the constants are zero), we get the zero polynomial, which is denoted by 0. What is the degree of the zero polynomial? The degree of the zero polynomial is not defined. So far we have dealt with polynomials in one variable only. We can also have polynomials in more than one variable. For example, x2 + y2 + xyz (where variables are x, y and z) is a polynomial in three variables. Similarly p2 + q10 + r (where the variables are p, q and r), u3 + v2 (where the variables are u and v) are polynomials in three and two variables, respectively. You will be studying such polynomials in detail later. Reprint 2025-26"}

What is p(1)? Note that : p(1) = 1 – 1 = 0. As p(1) = 0, we say that 1 is a zero of the polynomial p(x). Similarly, you can check that 2 is a zero of q(x), where q(x) = x – 2. In general, we say that a zero of a polynomial p(x) is a number c such that p(c) = 0. You must have observed that the zero of the polynomial x – 1 is obtained by equating it to 0, i.e., x – 1 = 0, which gives x = 1. We say p(x) = 0 is a polynomial equation and 1 is the root of the polynomial equation p(x) = 0. So we say 1 is the zero of the polynomial x – 1, or a root of the polynomial equation x – 1 = 0. Now, consider the constant polynomial 5. Can you tell what its zero is? It has no zero because replacing x by any number in 5x0 still gives us 5. In fact, a non-zero constant polynomial has no zero. What about the zeroes of the zero polynomial? By convention, every real number is a zero of the zero polynomial. Example 3 : Check whether –2 and 2 are zeroes of the polynomial x + 2. Solution : Let p(x) = x + 2. Then p(2) = 2 + 2 = 4, p(–2) = –2 + 2 = 0 Therefore, –2 is a zero of the polynomial x + 2, but 2 is not. Example 4 : Find a zero of the polynomial p(x) = 2x + 1.

Now, if p(x) = ax + b, a ≠ 0, is a linear polynomial, how can we find a zero of p(x)? Example 4 may have given you some idea. Finding a zero of the polynomial p(x), amounts to solving the polynomial equation p(x) = 0. Now, p(x) = 0 means ax + b = 0, a ≠ 0 So, ax = –b i.e., x = – b a . So, x = b a − is the only zero of p(x), i.e., a linear polynomial has one and only one zero. Now we can say that 1 is the zero of x – 1, and –2 is the zero of x + 2.

It tells us that since the remainder, 1 2 q  −     = 0, (2t + 1) is a factor of q(t), i.e., q(t) = (2t + 1) g(t) for some polynomial g(t). This is a particular case of the following theorem. Factor Theorem : If p(x) is a polynomial of degree n > 1 and a is any real number, then (i) x – a is a factor of p(x), if p(a) = 0, and (ii) p(a) = 0, if x – a is a factor of p(x). Proof: By the Remainder Theorem, p(x)=(x – a) q(x) + p(a). (i) If p(a) = 0, then p(x) = (x – a) q(x), which shows that x – a is a factor of p(x). (ii) Since x – a is a factor of p(x), p(x) = (x – a) g(x) for same polynomial g(x). In this case, p(a) = (a – a) g(a) = 0. Example 6 : Examine whether x + 2 is a factor of x3 + 3x2 + 5x + 6 and of 2x + 4. Solution : The zero of x + 2 is –2. Let p(x) = x3 + 3x2 + 5x + 6 and s(x) = 2x + 4 Then, p(–2) = (–2)3 + 3(–2)2 + 5(–2) + 6 = –8 + 12 – 10 + 6 = 0 Reprint 2025-26"}

Again, s(–2) = 2(–2) + 4 = 0 So, x + 2 is a factor of 2x + 4. In fact, you can check this without applying the Factor Theorem, since 2x + 4 = 2(x + 2). Example 7 : Find the value of k, if x – 1 is a factor of 4x3 + 3x2 – 4x + k. Solution : As x – 1 is a factor of p(x) = 4x3 + 3x2 – 4x + k, p(1) = 0 Now, p(1) = 4(1)3 + 3(1)2 – 4(1) + k So, 4 + 3 – 4 + k = 0 i.e., k = –3 We will now use the Factor Theorem to factorise some polynomials of degree 2 and 3. You are already familiar with the factorisation of a quadratic polynomial like x2 + lx + m. You had factorised it by splitting the middle term lx as ax + bx so that ab = m. Then x2 + lx + m = (x + a) (x + b). We shall now try to factorise quadratic polynomials of the type ax2 + bx + c, where a ≠ 0 and a, b, c are constants. Factorisation of the polynomial ax2 + bx + c by splitting the middle term is as follows: Let its factors be (px + q) and (rx + s). Then ax2 + bx + c = (px + q) (rx + s) = pr x2 + (ps + qr) x + qs Comparing the coefficients of x2, we get a = pr. Similarly, comparing the coefficients of x, we get b = ps + qr. And, on comparing the constant terms, we get c = qs. This shows us that b is the sum of two numbers ps and qr, whose product is (ps)(qr) = (pr)(qs) = ac. Therefore, to factorise ax2 + bx + c, we have to write b as the sum of two numbers whose product is ac. This will be clear from Example 13. Example 8 : Factorise 6x2 + 17x + 5 by splitting the middle term, and by using the Factor Theorem. Solution 1 : (By splitting method) : If we can find two numbers p and q such that p + q = 17 and pq = 6 × 5 = 30, then we can get the factors. So, let us look for the pairs of factors of 30. Some are 1 and 30, 2 and 15, 3 and 10, 5 and 6. Of these pairs, 2 and 15 will give us p + q = 17. 2 3x x = 3x = first term of quotient Reprint 2025-26"}

However, let us consider another example. Example 9 : Factorise y2 – 5y + 6 by using the Factor Theorem. Solution : Let p(y) = y2 – 5y + 6. Now, if p(y) = (y – a) (y – b), you know that the constant term will be ab. So, ab = 6. So, to look for the factors of p(y), we look at the factors of 6. The factors of 6 are 1, 2 and 3. Now, p(2) = 22 – (5 × 2) + 6 = 0 So, y – 2 is a factor of p(y). Reprint 2025-26"}

Here, the splitting method will not be appropriate to start with. We need to find at least one factor first, as you will see in the following example. Example 10 : Factorise x3 – 23x2 + 142x – 120. Solution : Let p(x) = x3 – 23x2 + 142x – 120 We shall now look for all the factors of –120. Some of these are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±5, ±6, ±8, ±10, ±12, ±15, ±20, ±24, ±30, ±60. By trial, we find that p(1) = 0. So x – 1 is a factor of p(x). Now we see that x3 – 23x2 + 142x – 120 = x3 – x2 – 22x2 + 22x + 120x – 120 = x2(x –1) – 22x(x – 1) + 120(x – 1) (Why?) = (x – 1) (x2 – 22x + 120) [Taking (x – 1) common] We could have also got this by dividing p(x) by x – 1. Now x2 – 22x + 120 can be factorised either by splitting the middle term or by using the Factor theorem. By splitting the middle term, we have: x2 – 22x + 120 = x2 – 12x – 10x + 120 = x(x – 12) – 10(x – 12) = (x – 12) (x – 10) So, x3 – 23x2 – 142x – 120 = (x – 1)(x – 10)(x – 12) EXERCISE 2.3 1.

You also know how to describe the position of a point on the line. There are many other situations, in which to find a point we are required to describe its position with reference to more than one line. For example, consider the following situations: I. In Fig. 3.1, there is a main road running in the East-West direction and streets with numbering from West to East. Also, on each street, house numbers are marked. To look for a friend’s house here, is it enough to know only one reference point? For instance, if we only know that she lives on Street 2, will we be able to find her house easily? Not as easily as when we know two pieces of information about it, namely, the number of the street on which it is situated, and the house number. If we want to reach the house which is situated in the 2nd street and has the number 5, first of all we would identify the 2nd street and then the house numbered 5 on it. In Fig. 3.1, H shows the location of the house. Similarly, P shows the location of the house corresponding to Street number 7 and House number 4. Fig. 3.1 Reprint 2025-26"}

If we ask you to tell us the position of the dot on the paper, how will you do this? Perhaps you will try in some such manner: “The dot is in the upper half of the paper”, or “It is near the left edge of the paper”, or “It is very near the left hand upper corner of the sheet”. Do any of these statements fix the position of the dot precisely? No! But, if you say “ The dot is nearly 5 cm away from the left edge of the paper”, it helps to give some idea but still does not fix the position of the dot. A little thought might enable you to say that the dot is also at a distance of 9 cm above the bottom line. We now know exactly where the dot is! Fig. 3.2 For this purpose, we fixed the position of the dot by specifying its distances from two fixed lines, the left edge of the paper and the bottom line of the paper [Fig.3.2 (b)]. In other words, we need two independent informations for finding the position of the dot. Now, perform the following classroom activity known as ‘Seating Plan’. Activity 1 (Seating Plan) : Draw a plan of the seating in your classroom, pushing all the desks together. Represent each desk by a square. In each square, write the name of the student occupying the desk, which the square represents. Position of each student in the classroom is described precisely by using two independent informations: (i) the column in which she or he sits, (ii) the row in which she or he sits. If you are sitting on the desk lying in the 5th column and 3rd row (represented by the shaded square in Fig. 3.3), your position could be written as (5, 3), first writing the column number, and then the row number. Is this the same as (3, 5)? Write down the names and positions of other students in your class. For example, if Sonia is sitting in the 4th column and 1st row, write S(4,1). The teacher’s desk is not part of your seating plan. We are treating the teacher just as an observer. Reprint 2025-26"}

In case of ‘dot’, we require distance of the dot from bottom line as well as from left edge of the paper. In case of seating plan, we require the number of the column and that of the row. This simple idea has far reaching consequences, and has given rise to a very important branch of Mathematics known as Coordinate Geometry. In this chapter, we aim to introduce some basic concepts of coordinate geometry. You will study more about these in your higher classes. This study was initially developed by the French philosopher and mathematician René Déscartes. René Déscartes, the great French mathematician of the seventeenth century, liked to lie in bed and think! One day, when resting in bed, he solved the problem of describing the position of a point in a plane. His method was a development of the older idea of latitude and longitude. In honour of Déscartes, the system used for describing the position of a point in a plane is also known as the Cartesian system. EXERCISE 3.1 1.

There are 5 streets in each direction. Using 1cm = 200 m, draw a model of the city on your notebook. Represent the roads/streets by single lines. There are many cross- streets in your model. A particular cross-street is made by two streets, one running in the North - South direction and another in the East - West direction. Each cross street is referred to in the following manner : If the 2nd street running in the North - South direction and 5th in the East - West direction meet at some crossing, then we will call this cross-street (2, 5). Using this convention, find: (i) how many cross - streets can be referred to as (4, 3). (ii) how many cross - streets can be referred to as (3, 4). 3.2 Cartesian System You have studied the number line in the chapter on ‘Number System’. On the number line, distances from a fixed point are marked in equal units positively in one direction and negatively in the other. The point from which the distances are marked is called the origin. We use the number line to represent the numbers by marking points on a line at equal distances. If one unit distance represents the number ‘1’, then 3 units distance represents the number ‘3’, ‘0’ being at the origin. The point in the positive direction at a distance r from the origin represents the number r. The point in the negative direction at a distance r from the origin represents the number −r. Locations of different numbers on the number line are shown in Fig. 3.5. Fig. 3.5 Descartes invented the idea of placing two such lines perpendicular to each other on a plane, and locating points on the plane by referring them to these lines. The perpendicular lines may be in any direction such as in Fig.3.6. But, when we choose Fig. 3.6 Reprint 2025-26"}

Since the positive numbers lie on the directions OX and OY, OX and OY are called the positive directions of the x - axis and the y - axis, respectively.

Now, let us see why this system is so basic to mathematics, and how it is useful. Consider the following diagram where the axes are drawn on graph paper. Let us see the distances of the points P and Q from the axes. For this, we draw perpendiculars PM on the x - axis and PN on the y - axis. Similarly, we draw perpendiculars QR and QS as shown in Fig. 3.10. Fig.3.10 You find that (i) The perpendicular distance of the point P from the y - axis measured along the positive direction of the x - axis is PN = OM = 4 units. (ii) The perpendicular distance of the point P from the x - axis measured along the positive direction of the y - axis is PM = ON = 3 units. Fig. 3.9 Reprint 2025-26"}

(iv) The perpendicular distance of the point Q from the x - axis measured along the negative direction of the y - axis is OS = RQ = 2 units. Now, using these distances, how can we describe the points so that there is no confusion? We write the coordinates of a point, using the following conventions: (i) The x - coordinate of a point is its perpendicular distance from the y - axis measured along the x -axis (positive along the positive direction of the x - axis and negative along the negative direction of the x - axis). For the point P, it is + 4 and for Q, it is – 6. The x - coordinate is also called the abscissa. (ii) The y - coordinate of a point is its perpendicular distance from the x - axis measured along the y - axis (positive along the positive direction of the y - axis and negative along the negative direction of the y - axis). For the point P, it is + 3 and for Q, it is –2. The y - coordinate is also called the ordinate. (iii) In stating the coordinates of a point in the coordinate plane, the x - coordinate comes first, and then the y - coordinate. We place the coordinates in brackets. Hence, the coordinates of P are (4, 3) and the coordinates of Q are (– 6, – 2). Note that the coordinates describe a point in the plane uniquely. (3, 4) is not the same as (4, 3).

Similarly, the coordinates of any point on the y - axis are of the form (0, y), where y is the distance of the point from the x - axis. Why? What are the coordinates of the origin O?

Can you write down a linear equation in one variable? You may say that x + 1 = 0, x + 2 = 0 and 2 y + 3 = 0 are examples of linear equations in one variable. You also know that such equations have a unique (i.e., one and only one) solution. You may also remember how to represent the solution on a number line. In this chapter, the knowledge of linear equations in one variable shall be recalled and extended to that of two variables. You will be considering questions like: Does a linear equation in two variables have a solution? If yes, is it unique? What does the solution look like on the Cartesian plane? You shall also use the concepts you studied in Chapter 3 to answer these questions. 4.2 Linear Equations Let us first recall what you have studied so far. Consider the following equation: 2x + 5 = 0 Its solution, i.e., the root of the equation, is 5 2 − . This can be represented on the number line as shown below: Fig. 4.1 Reprint 2025-26"}
{"class": "class 9", "subject": "maths", "page_no": 68, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "56 MATHEMATICS While solving an equation, you must always keep the following points in mind: The solution of a linear equation is not affected when: (i) the same number is added to (or subtracted from) both the sides of the equation. (ii) you multiply or divide both the sides of the equation by the same non-zero number. Let us now consider the following situation: In a One-day International Cricket match between India and Sri Lanka played in Nagpur, two Indian batsmen together scored 176 runs. Express this information in the form of an equation. Here, you can see that the score of neither of them is known, i.e., there are two unknown quantities. Let us use x and y to denote them. So, the number of runs scored by one of the batsmen is x, and the number of runs scored by the other is y. We know that x + y = 176, which is the required equation. This is an example of a linear equation in two variables. It is customary to denote the variables in such equations by x and y, but other letters may also be used. Some examples of linear equations in two variables are: 1.2s + 3t = 5, p + 4q = 7, πu + 5v = 9 and 3 = 2 x – 7y. Note that you can put these equations in the form 1.2s + 3t – 5 = 0, p + 4q – 7 = 0, πu + 5v – 9 = 0 and 2 x – 7y – 3 = 0, respectively. So, any equation which can be put in the form ax + by + c = 0, where a, b and c are real numbers, and a and b are not both zero, is called a linear equation in two variables. This means that you can think of many many such equations. Example 1 : Write each of the following equations in the form ax + by + c = 0 and indicate the values of a, b and c in each case: (i) 2x + 3y = 4.37 (ii) x – 4 = 3 y (iii) 4 = 5x – 3y (iv) 2x = y Solution : (i) 2x + 3y = 4.37 can be written as 2x + 3y – 4.37 = 0.

What can you say about the solution of a linear equation involving two variables? As there are two variables in the equation, a solution means a pair of values, one for x and one for y which satisfy the given equation. Let us consider the equation 2x + 3y = 12. Here, x = 3 and y = 2 is a solution because when you substitute x = 3 and y = 2 in the equation above, you find that 2x + 3y = (2 × 3) + (3 × 2) = 12 This solution is written as an ordered pair (3, 2), first writing the value for x and then the value for y.

Note that (0, 4) is a solution but not (4, 0). You have seen at least two solutions for 2x + 3y = 12, i.e., (3, 2) and (0, 4). Can you find any other solution? Do you agree that (6, 0) is another solution? Verify the same. In fact, we can get many many solutions in the following way. Pick a value of your choice for x (say x = 2) in 2x + 3y = 12. Then the equation reduces to 4 + 3y = 12, which is a linear equation in one variable. On solving this, you get y = 8 3. So 8 2, 3       is another solution of 2x + 3y = 12. Similarly, choosing x = – 5, you find that the equation becomes –10 + 3y = 12. This gives y = 22 3 . So, 22 5, 3   −     is another solution of 2x + 3y = 12. So there is no end to different solutions of a linear equation in two variables. That is, a linear equation in two variables has infinitely many solutions. Example 3 : Find four different solutions of the equation x + 2y = 6. Solution : By inspection, x = 2, y = 2 is a solution because for x = 2, y = 2 x + 2y = 2 + 4 = 6 Now, let us choose x = 0. With this value of x, the given equation reduces to 2y = 6 which has the unique solution y = 3. So x = 0, y = 3 is also a solution of x + 2y = 6. Similarly, taking y = 0, the given equation reduces to x = 6. So, x = 6, y = 0 is a solution of x + 2y = 6 as well. Finally, let us take y = 1. The given equation now reduces to x + 2 = 6, whose solution is given by x = 4. Therefore, (4, 1) is also a solution of the given equation. So four of the infinitely many solutions of the given equation are: (2, 2), (0, 3), (6, 0) and (4, 1). Remark : Note that an easy way of getting a solution is to take x = 0 and get the corresponding value of y. Similarly, we can put y = 0 and obtain the corresponding value of x.

Geometry appears to have originated from the need for measuring land. This branch of mathematics was studied in various forms in every ancient civilisation, be it in Egypt, Babylonia, China, India, Greece, the Incas, etc. The people of these civilisations faced several practical problems which required the development of geometry in various ways. For example, whenever the river Nile overflowed, it wiped out the boundaries between the adjoining fields of different land owners. After such flooding, these boundaries had to be redrawn. For this purpose, the Egyptians developed a number of geometric techniques and rules for calculating simple areas and also for doing simple constructions. The knowledge of geometry was also used by them for computing volumes of granaries, and for constructing canals and pyramids. They also knew the correct formula to find the volume of a truncated pyramid (see Fig. 5.1).You know that a pyramid is a solid figure, the base of which is a triangle, or square, or some other polygon, and its side faces are triangles converging to a point at the top.

It was a highly organised society. The cities were highly developed and very well planned. For example, the roads were parallel to each other and there was an underground drainage system. The houses had many rooms of different types. This shows that the town dwellers were skilled in mensuration and practical arithmetic. The bricks used for constructions were kiln fired and the ratio length : breadth : thickness, of the bricks was found to be 4 : 2 : 1. In ancient India, the Sulbasutras (800 BCE to 500 BCE) were the manuals of geometrical constructions. The geometry of the Vedic period originated with the construction of altars (or vedis) and fireplaces for performing Vedic rites. The location of the sacred fires had to be in accordance to the clearly laid down instructions about their shapes and areas, if they were to be effective instruments. Square and circular altars were used for household rituals, while altars whose shapes were combinations of rectangles, triangles and trapeziums were required for public worship. The sriyantra (given in the Atharvaveda) consists of nine interwoven isosceles triangles. These triangles are arranged in such a way that they produce 43 subsidiary triangles. Though accurate geometric methods were used for the constructions of altars, the principles behind them were not discussed. These examples show that geometry was being developed and applied everywhere in the world. But this was happening in an unsystematic manner. What is interesting about these developments of geometry in the ancient world is that they were passed on from one generation to the next, either orally or through palm leaf messages, or by other ways. Also, we find that in some civilisations like Babylonia, geometry remained a very practical oriented discipline, as was the case in India and Rome. The geometry developed by Egyptians mainly consisted of the statements of results. There were no general rules of the procedure. In fact, Babylonians and Egyptians used geometry mostly for practical purposes and did very little to develop it as a systematic science. But in civilisations like Greece, the emphasis was on the reasoning behind why certain constructions work. The Greeks were interested in establishing the truth of the statements they discovered using deductive reasoning (see Appendix 1). A Greek mathematician, Thales is credited with giving the first known proof. This proof was of the statement that a circle is bisected (i.e., cut into two equal parts) by its diameter. One of Thales’ most famous pupils was Pythagoras (572 BCE), whom you have heard about. Pythagoras and his group discovered many geometric properties and developed the theory of geometry to a great extent. This process continued till 300 BCE. At that time Euclid, a teacher of mathematics at Alexandria in Egypt, collected all the known work and arranged it in his famous treatise, Thales (640 BCE – 546 BCE) Fig. 5.2 Reprint 2025-26"}

He divided the ‘Elements’ into thirteen chapters, each called a book. These books influenced the whole world’s understanding of geometry for generations to come. In this chapter, we shall discuss Euclid’s approach to geometry and shall try to link it with the present day geometry. 5.2 Euclid’s Definitions, Axioms and Postulates The Greek mathematicians of Euclid’s time thought of geometry as an abstract model of the world in which they lived. The notions of point, line, plane (or surface) and so on were derived from what was seen around them. From studies of the space and solids in the space around them, an abstract geometrical notion of a solid object was developed. A solid has shape, size, position, and can be moved from one place to another. Its boundaries are called surfaces. They separate one part of the space from another, and are said to have no thickness. The boundaries of the surfaces are curves or straight lines. These lines end in points. Consider the three steps from solids to points (solids-surfaces-lines-points). In each step we lose one extension, also called a dimension. So, a solid has three dimensions, a surface has two, a line has one and a point has none. Euclid summarised these statements as definitions. He began his exposition by listing 23 definitions in Book 1 of the ‘Elements’. A few of them are given below : 1. A point is that which has no part. 2. A line is breadthless length. 3. The ends of a line are points. 4. A straight line is a line which lies evenly with the points on itself. 5. A surface is that which has length and breadth only. 6. The edges of a surface are lines. 7. A plane surface is a surface which lies evenly with the straight lines on itself. If you carefully study these definitions, you find that some of the terms like part, breadth, length, evenly, etc. need to be further explained clearly. For example, consider his definition of a point. In this definition, ‘a part’ needs to be defined. Suppose if you define ‘a part’ to be that which occupies ‘area’, again ‘an area’ needs to be defined. So, to define one thing, you need to define many other things, and you may get a long chain of definitions without an end. For such reasons, mathematicians agree to leave Euclid (325 BCE – 265 BCE) Fig. 5.3 Reprint 2025-26"}

However, we do have a intuitive feeling for the geometric concept of a point than what the ‘definition’ above gives us. So, we represent a point as a dot, even though a dot has some dimension. A similar problem arises in Definition 2 above, since it refers to breadth and length, neither of which has been defined. Because of this, a few terms are kept undefined while developing any course of study. So, in geometry, we take a point, a line and a plane (in Euclid‘s words a plane surface) as undefined terms. The only thing is that we can represent them intuitively, or explain them with the help of ‘physical models’. Starting with his definitions, Euclid assumed certain properties, which were not to be proved. These assumptions are actually ‘obvious universal truths’. He divided them into two types: axioms and postulates. He used the term ‘postulate’ for the assumptions that were specific to geometry. Common notions (often called axioms), on the other hand, were assumptions used throughout mathematics and not specifically linked to geometry. For details about axioms and postulates, refer to Appendix 1. Some of Euclid’s axioms, not in his order, are given below : (1) Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another. (2) If equals are added to equals, the wholes are equal. (3) If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal. (4) Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another. (5) The whole is greater than the part. (6) Things which are double of the same things are equal to one another. (7) Things which are halves of the same things are equal to one another. These ‘common notions’ refer to magnitudes of some kind. The first common notion could be applied to plane figures. For example, if an area of a triangle equals the area of a rectangle and the area of the rectangle equals that of a square, then the area of the triangle also equals the area of the square. Magnitudes of the same kind can be compared and added, but magnitudes of different kinds cannot be compared. For example, a line cannot be compared to a rectangle, nor can an angle be compared to a pentagon. The 4th axiom given above seems to say that if two things are identical (that is, they are the same), then they are equal. In other words, everything equals itself. It is the justification of the principle of superposition. Axiom (5) gives us the definition of ‘greater than’. For example, if a quantity B is a part of another quantity A, then A can be written as the sum of B and some third quantity C. Symbolically, A > B means that there is some C such that A = B + C.

They are : Postulate 1 : A straight line may be drawn from any one point to any other point. Note that this postulate tells us that at least one straight line passes through two distinct points, but it does not say that there cannot be more than one such line. However, in his work, Euclid has frequently assumed, without mentioning, that there is a unique line joining two distinct points. We state this result in the form of an axiom as follows: Axiom 5.1 : Given two distinct points, there is a unique line that passes through them. How many lines passing through P also pass through Q (see Fig. 5.4)? Only one, that is, the line PQ. How many lines passing through Q also pass through P? Only one, that is, the line PQ. Thus, the statement above is self-evident, and so is taken as an axiom. Fig. 5.4 Postulate 2 : A terminated line can be produced indefinitely. Note that what we call a line segment now-a-days is what Euclid called a terminated line. So, according to the present day terms, the second postulate says that a line segment can be extended on either side to form a line (see Fig. 5.5). Fig. 5.5 Postulate 3 : A circle can be drawn with any centre and any radius. Postulate 4 : All right angles are equal to one another. Postulate 5 : If a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same side of it taken together less than two right angles, then the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which the sum of angles is less than two right angles.

Therefore, the lines AB and CD will eventually intersect on the left side of PQ. A brief look at the five postulates brings to your notice that Postulate 5 is far more complex than any other postulate. On the other hand, Postulates 1 through 4 are so simple and obvious that these are taken as ‘self-evident truths’. However, it is not possible to prove them. So, these statements are accepted without any proof (see Appendix 1). Because of its complexity, the fifth postulate will be given more attention in the next section. Now-a-days, ‘postulates’ and ‘axioms’ are terms that are used interchangeably and in the same sense. ‘Postulate’ is actually a verb. When we say “let us postulate”, we mean, “let us make some statement based on the observed phenomenon in the Universe”. Its truth/validity is checked afterwards. If it is true, then it is accepted as a ‘Postulate’. A system of axioms is called consistent (see Appendix 1), if it is impossible to deduce from these axioms a statement that contradicts any axiom or previously proved statement. So, when any system of axioms is given, it needs to be ensured that the system is consistent. After Euclid stated his postulates and axioms, he used them to prove other results. Then using these results, he proved some more results by applying deductive reasoning. The statements that were proved are called propositions or theorems. Euclid deduced 465 propositions in a logical chain using his axioms, postulates, definitions and theorems proved earlier in the chain. In the next few chapters on geometry, you will be using these axioms to prove some theorems. Now, let us see in the following examples how Euclid used his axioms and postulates for proving some of the results: Example 1 : If A, B and C are three points on a line, and B lies between A and C (see Fig. 5.7), then prove that AB + BC = AC.

Also, Euclid’s Axiom (4) says that things which coincide with one another are equal to one another. So, it can be deduced that AB + BC = AC Note that in this solution, it has been assumed that there is a unique line passing through two points. Example 2 : Prove that an equilateral triangle can be constructed on any given line segment. Solution : In the statement above, a line segment of any length is given, say AB [see Fig. 5.8(i)]. Fig. 5.8 Here, you need to do some construction. Using Euclid’s Postulate 3, you can draw a circle with point A as the centre and AB as the radius [see Fig. 5.8(ii)]. Similarly, draw another circle with point B as the centre and BA as the radius. The two circles meet at a point, say C. Now, draw the line segments AC and BC to form ∆ ABC [see Fig. 5.8 (iii)]. So, you have to prove that this triangle is equilateral, i.e., AB = AC = BC. Now, AB = AC, since they are the radii of the same circle (1) Similarly, AB = BC (Radii of the same circle) (2) From these two facts, and Euclid’s axiom that things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another, you can conclude that AB = BC = AC. So, ∆ ABC is an equilateral triangle. Note that here Euclid has assumed, without mentioning anywhere, that the two circles drawn with centres A and B will meet each other at a point.

But this assumption clashes with the axiom that only one line can pass through two distinct points.

You have also studied some axioms and, with the help of these axioms, you proved some other statements. In this chapter, you will study the properties of the angles formed when two lines intersect each other, and also the properties of the angles formed when a line intersects two or more parallel lines at distinct points. Further you will use these properties to prove some statements using deductive reasoning (see Appendix 1). You have already verified these statements through some activities in the earlier classes. In your daily life, you see different types of angles formed between the edges of plane surfaces. For making a similar kind of model using the plane surfaces, you need to have a thorough knowledge of angles. For instance, suppose you want to make a model of a hut to keep in the school exhibition using bamboo sticks. Imagine how you would make it? You would keep some of the sticks parallel to each other, and some sticks would be kept slanted. Whenever an architect has to draw a plan for a multistoried building, she has to draw intersecting lines and parallel lines at different angles. Without the knowledge of the properties of these lines and angles, do you think she can draw the layout of the building? In science, you study the properties of light by drawing the ray diagrams. For example, to study the refraction property of light when it enters from one medium to the other medium, you use the properties of intersecting lines and parallel lines. When two or more forces act on a body, you draw the diagram in which forces are represented by directed line segments to study the net effect of the forces on the body. At that time, you need to know the relation between the angles when the rays (or line segments) are parallel to or intersect each other.

Plenty of other examples can be given where lines and angles are used. In the subsequent chapters of geometry, you will be using these properties of lines and angles to deduce more and more useful properties. Let us first revise the terms and definitions related to lines and angles learnt in earlier classes. 6.2 Basic Terms and Definitions Recall that a part (or portion) of a line with two end points is called a line-segment and a part of a line with one end point is called a ray. Note that the line segment AB is denoted by AB , and its length is denoted by AB. The ray AB is denoted by AB \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002 , and a line is denoted by AB \u0003\u0001\u0001\u0002 . However, we will not use these symbols, and will denote the line segment AB, ray AB, length AB and line AB by the same symbol, AB. The meaning will be clear from the context. Sometimes small letters l, m, n, etc. will be used to denote lines. If three or more points lie on the same line, they are called collinear points; otherwise they are called non-collinear points. Recall that an angle is formed when two rays originate from the same end point. The rays making an angle are called the arms of the angle and the end point is called the vertex of the angle. You have studied different types of angles, such as acute angle, right angle, obtuse angle, straight angle and reflex angle in earlier classes (see Fig. 6.1). (i) acute angle : 0° < x < 90° (ii) right angle : y = 90° (iii) obtuse angle : 90° < z < 180° (iv) straight angle : s = 180° (v) reflex angle : 180° < t < 360° Fig. 6.1 : Types of Angles Reprint 2025-26"}
{"class": "class 9", "subject": "maths", "page_no": 83, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "LINES AND ANGLES 71 An acute angle measures between 0° and 90°, whereas a right angle is exactly equal to 90°. An angle greater than 90° but less than 180° is called an obtuse angle. Also, recall that a straight angle is equal to 180°. An angle which is greater than 180° but less than 360° is called a reflex angle. Further, two angles whose sum is 90° are called complementary angles, and two angles whose sum is 180° are called supplementary angles. You have also studied about adjacent angles in the earlier classes (see Fig. 6.2). Two angles are adjacent, if they have a common vertex, a common arm and their non-common arms are on different sides of the common arm. In Fig. 6.2, ∠ ABD and ∠ DBC are adjacent angles. Ray BD is their common arm and point B is their common vertex. Ray BA and ray BC are non common arms. Moreover, when two angles are adjacent, then their sum is always equal to the angle formed by the two non- common arms. So, we can write ∠ ABC = ∠ ABD + ∠ DBC. Note that ∠ ABC and ∠ ABD are not adjacent angles. Why? Because their non- common arms BD and BC lie on the same side of the common arm BA. If the non-common arms BA and BC in Fig. 6.2, form a line then it will look like Fig. 6.3. In this case, ∠ ABD and ∠ DBC are called linear pair of angles. You may also recall the vertically opposite angles formed when two lines, say AB and CD, intersect each other, say at the point O (see Fig. 6.4). There are two pairs of vertically opposite angles. One pair is ∠AOD and ∠BOC. Can you find the other pair? Fig. 6.2 : Adjacent angles Fig. 6.3 : Linear pair of angles Fig. 6.4 : Vertically opposite angles Reprint 2025-26"}

(i) Intersecting lines (ii) Non-intersecting (parallel) lines Fig. 6.5 : Different ways of drawing two lines Recall the notion of a line, that it extends indefinitely in both directions.

Note that the lengths of the common perpendiculars at different points on these parallel lines is the same. This equal length is called the distance between two parallel lines. 6.4 Pairs of Angles In Section 6.2, you have learnt the definitions of some of the pairs of angles such as complementary angles, supplementary angles, adjacent angles, linear pair of angles, etc. Can you think of some relations between these angles? Now, let us find out the relation between the angles formed when a ray stands on a line. Draw a figure in which a ray stands on a line as shown in Fig. 6.6. Name the line as AB and the ray as OC. What are the angles formed at the point O? They are ∠ AOC, ∠ BOC and ∠ AOB. Can we write ∠ AOC + ∠ BOC = ∠ AOB? (1) Yes! (Why? Refer to adjacent angles in Section 6.2) What is the measure of ∠ AOB? It is 180°. (Why?) (2) From (1) and (2), can you say that ∠ AOC + ∠ BOC = 180°? Yes! (Why?)

Recall that when the sum of two adjacent angles is 180°, then they are called a linear pair of angles. In Axiom 6.1, it is given that ‘a ray stands on a line’. From this ‘given’, we have concluded that ‘the sum of two adjacent angles so formed is 180°’. Can we write Axiom 6.1 the other way? That is, take the ‘conclusion’ of Axiom 6.1 as ‘given’ and the ‘given’ as the ‘conclusion’. So it becomes: (A) If the sum of two adjacent angles is 180°, then a ray stands on a line (that is, the non-common arms form a line). Now you see that the Axiom 6.1 and statement (A) are in a sense the reverse of each others. We call each as converse of the other. We do not know whether the statement (A) is true or not. Let us check. Draw adjacent angles of different measures as shown in Fig. 6.7. Keep the ruler along one of the non-common arms in each case. Does the other non-common arm also lie along the ruler?

Also see that ∠ AOC + ∠ COB = 125° + 55° = 180°. From this, you may conclude that statement (A) is true. So, you can state in the form of an axiom as follows: Axiom 6.2 : If the sum of two adjacent angles is 180°, then the non-common arms of the angles form a line. For obvious reasons, the two axioms above together is called the Linear Pair Axiom. Let us now examine the case when two lines intersect each other. Recall, from earlier classes, that when two lines intersect, the vertically opposite angles are equal. Let us prove this result now. See Appendix 1 for the ingredients of a proof, and keep those in mind while studying the proof given below. Theorem 6.1 : If two lines intersect each other, then the vertically opposite angles are equal. Proof : In the statement above, it is given that ‘two lines intersect each other’. So, let AB and CD be two lines intersecting at O as shown in Fig. 6.8. They lead to two pairs of vertically opposite angles, namely, (i) ∠ AOC and ∠ BOD (ii) ∠ AOD and ∠ BOC. We need to prove that ∠ AOC = ∠ BOD and ∠ AOD = ∠ BOC. Now, ray OA stands on line CD. Therefore, ∠ AOC + ∠ AOD = 180° (Linear pair axiom) (1) Can we write ∠ AOD + ∠ BOD = 180°? Yes! (Why?) (2) From (1) and (2), we can write ∠ AOC + ∠ AOD = ∠ AOD + ∠ BOD This implies that ∠ AOC = ∠ BOD (Refer Section 5.2, Axiom 3) Similarly, it can be proved that ∠AOD = ∠BOC Now, let us do some examples based on Linear Pair Axiom and Theorem 6.1.

You know that a closed figure formed by three intersecting lines is called a triangle. (‘Tri’ means ‘three’). A triangle has three sides, three angles and three vertices. For example, in triangle ABC, denoted as ∆ ABC (see Fig. 7.1); AB, BC, CA are the three sides, ∠ A, ∠ B, ∠ C are the three angles and A, B, C are three vertices. In Chapter 6, you have also studied some properties of triangles. In this chapter, you will study in details about the congruence of triangles, rules of congruence, some more properties of triangles and inequalities in a triangle. You have already verified most of these properties in earlier classes. We will now prove some of them. 7.2 Congruence of Triangles You must have observed that two copies of your photographs of the same size are identical. Similarly, two bangles of the same size, two ATM cards issued by the same bank are identical. You may recall that on placing a one rupee coin on another minted in the same year, they cover each other completely. Do you remember what such figures are called? Indeed they are called congruent figures (‘congruent’ means equal in all respects or figures whose shapes and sizes are both the same). Now, draw two circles of the same radius and place one on the other. What do you observe? They cover each other completely and we call them as congruent circles. Fig. 7.1 Reprint 2025-26"}

You will observe that the squares are congruent to each other and so are the equilateral triangles. You may wonder why we are studying congruence. You all must have seen the ice tray in your refrigerator. Observe that the moulds for making ice are all congruent. The cast used for moulding in the tray also has congruent depressions (may be all are rectangular or all circular or all triangular). So, whenever identical objects have to be produced, the concept of congruence is used in making the cast. Sometimes, you may find it difficult to replace the refill in your pen by a new one and this is so when the new refill is not of the same size as the one you want to remove. Obviously, if the two refills are identical or congruent, the new refill fits. So, you can find numerous examples where congruence of objects is applied in daily life situations. Can you think of some more examples of congruent figures? Now, which of the following figures are not congruent to the square in Fig 7.3 (i) : Fig. 7.3 The large squares in Fig. 7.3 (ii) and (iii) are obviously not congruent to the one in Fig 7.3 (i), but the square in Fig 7.3 (iv) is congruent to the one given in Fig 7.3 (i).

Observe that triangles in Fig. 7.4 (ii), (iii) and (iv) are congruent to ∆ ABC while ∆ TSU of Fig 7.4 (v) is not congruent to ∆ ABC. If ∆ PQR is congruent to ∆ ABC, we write ∆ PQR ≅ ∆ ABC. Notice that when ∆ PQR ≅ ∆ ABC, then sides of ∆ PQR fall on corresponding equal sides of ∆ ABC and so is the case for the angles. That is, PQ covers AB, QR covers BC and RP covers CA; ∠ P covers ∠ A, ∠ Q covers ∠ B and ∠ R covers ∠ C. Also, there is a one-one correspondence between the vertices. That is, P corresponds to A, Q to B, R to C and so on which is written as P ↔ A, Q ↔ B, R ↔ C Note that under this correspondence, ∆ PQR ≅ ∆ ABC; but it will not be correct to write ∆QRP ≅ ∆ ABC.

Note that in congruent triangles corresponding parts are equal and we write in short ‘CPCT’ for corresponding parts of congruent triangles. 7.3 Criteria for Congruence of Triangles In earlier classes, you have learnt four criteria for congruence of triangles. Let us recall them. Draw two triangles with one side 3 cm. Are these triangles congruent? Observe that they are not congruent (see Fig. 7.5).

Repeat this activity with some more pairs of triangles. So, equality of one pair of sides or one pair of sides and one pair of angles is not sufficient to give us congruent triangles. What would happen if the other pair of arms (sides) of the equal angles are also equal? In Fig 7.7, BC = QR, ∠ B = ∠ Q and also, AB = PQ. Now, what can you say about congruence of ∆ABC and ∆PQR? Recall from your earlier classes that, in this case, the two triangles are congruent. Verify this for ∆ ABC and ∆ PQR in Fig. 7.7. Repeat this activity with other pairs of triangles. Do you observe that the equality of two sides and the included angle is enough for the congruence of triangles? Yes, it is enough. Fig. 7.7 This is the first criterion for congruence of triangles. Axiom 7.1 (SAS congruence rule) : Two triangles are congruent if two sides and the included angle of one triangle are equal to the two sides and the included angle of the other triangle. This result cannot be proved with the help of previously known results and so it is accepted true as an axiom (see Appendix 1). Let us now take some examples. Example 1 : In Fig. 7.8, OA = OB and OD = OC. Show that (i) ∆ AOD ≅ ∆ BOC and (ii) AD || BC.

So, ∆ AOD ≅∆ BOC (by the SAS congruence rule) (ii) In congruent triangles AOD and BOC, the other corresponding parts are also equal. So, ∠ OAD = ∠ OBC and these form a pair of alternate angles for line segments AD and BC. Therefore, AD || BC. Example 2 : AB is a line segment and line l is its perpendicular bisector. If a point P lies on l, show that P is equidistant from A and B. Solution : Line l ⊥ AB and passes through C which is the mid-point of AB (see Fig. 7.9). You have to show that PA = PB. Consider ∆ PCA and ∆ PCB. We have AC = BC (C is the mid-point of AB) ∠ PCA = ∠ PCB = 90° (Given) PC = PC (Common) So, ∆ PCA ≅ ∆ PCB (SAS rule) and so, PA = PB, as they are corresponding sides of congruent triangles. Now, let us construct two triangles, whose sides are 4 cm and 5 cm and one of the angles is 50° and this angle is not included in between the equal sides (see Fig. 7.10).

Suppose, now in two triangles two pairs of angles and one pair of corresponding sides are equal but the side is not included between the corresponding equal pairs of angles. Are the triangles still congruent? You will observe that they are congruent. Can you reason out why? You know that the sum of the three angles of a triangle is 180°. So if two pairs of angles are equal, the third pair is also equal (180° – sum of equal angles). So, two triangles are congruent if any two pairs of angles and one pair of corresponding sides are equal. We may call it as the AAS Congruence Rule. Now let us perform the following activity : Draw triangles with angles 40°, 50° and 90°. How many such triangles can you draw?

A quadrilateral has four sides, four angles and four vertices. A parallelogram is a quadrilateral in which both pairs of opposite sides are parallel. Let us perform an activity. Cut out a parallelogram from a sheet of paper and cut it along a diagonal (see Fig. 8.1). You obtain two triangles. What can you say about these triangles? Place one triangle over the other. Turn one around, if necessary. What do you observe? Observe that the two triangles are congruent to each other. Repeat this activity with some more parallelograms. Each time you will observe that each diagonal divides the parallelogram into two congruent triangles. Let us now prove this result. Theorem 8.1 : A diagonal of a parallelogram divides it into two congruent triangles. Proof : Let ABCD be a parallelogram and AC be a diagonal (see Fig. 8.2). Observe that the diagonal AC divides parallelogram ABCD into two triangles, namely, ∆ ABC and ∆ CDA. We need to prove that these triangles are congruent. Fig. 8.1 Reprint 2025-26"}

Now, measure the opposite sides of parallelogram ABCD. What do you observe? You will find that AB = DC and AD = BC. This is another property of a parallelogram stated below: Theorem 8.2 : In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. You have already proved that a diagonal divides the parallelogram into two congruent triangles; so what can you say about the corresponding parts say, the corresponding sides? They are equal. So, AB = DC and AD = BC Now what is the converse of this result? You already know that whatever is given in a theorem, the same is to be proved in the converse and whatever is proved in the theorem it is given in the converse. Thus, Theorem 8.2 can be stated as given below : If a quadrilateral is a parallelogram, then each pair of its opposite sides is equal. So its converse is : Theorem 8.3 : If each pair of opposite sides of a quadrilateral is equal, then it is a parallelogram. Can you reason out why? Let sides AB and CD of the quadrilateral ABCD be equal and also AD = BC (see Fig. 8.3). Draw diagonal AC. Clearly, ∆ ABC ≅∆ CDA (Why?) So, ∠ BAC = ∠ DCA and ∠ BCA = ∠ DAC (Why?)

Can we conclude the same result for the pairs of opposite angles? Draw a parallelogram and measure its angles. What do you observe? Each pair of opposite angles is equal. Repeat this with some more parallelograms. We arrive at yet another result as given below. Theorem 8.4 : In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. Now, is the converse of this result also true? Yes. Using the angle sum property of a quadrilateral and the results of parallel lines intersected by a transversal, we can see that the converse is also true. So, we have the following theorem : Theorem 8.5 : If in a quadrilateral, each pair of opposite angles is equal, then it is a parallelogram. There is yet another property of a parallelogram. Let us study the same. Draw a parallelogram ABCD and draw both its diagonals intersecting at the point O (see Fig. 8.4). Measure the lengths of OA, OB, OC and OD. What do you observe? You will observe that OA = OC and OB = OD. or, O is the mid-point of both the diagonals. Repeat this activity with some more parallelograms.

Example 1 : Show that each angle of a rectangle is a right angle. Solution : Let us recall what a rectangle is. A rectangle is a parallelogram in which one angle is a right angle. Let ABCD be a rectangle in which ∠ A = 90°. We have to show that ∠ B = ∠ C = ∠ D = 90° We have, AD || BC and AB is a transversal (see Fig. 8.6).

Solution : (i) ∆ ABC is isosceles in which AB = AC (Given) So, ∠ ABC = ∠ ACB (Angles opposite to equal sides) Also, ∠ PAC = ∠ ABC + ∠ ACB (Exterior angle of a triangle) or, ∠ PAC = 2∠ ACB (1) Now, AD bisects ∠ PAC.

Proof : You are given two equal chords AB and CD of a circle with centre O (see Fig.9.4). You want to prove that ∠ AOB = ∠ COD.

Since there are infinite numbers of points on a line, if you join these points to P, you will get infinitely many line segments PL1, PL2, PM, PL3, PL4, etc. Which of these is the distance of AB from P? You may think a while and get the answer. Out of these line segments, the perpendicular from P to AB, namely PM in Fig. 9.8, will be the least.

If you take two equal chords, what can you say about the size of arcs? Is one arc made by first chord equal to the corresponding arc made by another chord? In fact, they are more than just equal in length. They are congruent in the sense that if one arc is put on the other, without bending or twisting, one superimposes the other completely. You can verify this fact by cutting the arc, corresponding to the chord CD from the circle along CD and put it on the corresponding arc made by equal chord AB. You will find that the arc CD superimpose the arc AB completely (see Fig. 9.13). This shows that equal chords make congruent arcs and conversely congruent arcs make equal chords of a circle. You can state it as follows: If two chords of a circle are equal, then their corresponding arcs are congruent and conversely, if two arcs are congruent, then their corresponding chords are equal.

Therefore, in Fig 9.14, the angle subtended by the minor arc PQ at O is ∠POQ and the angle subtended by the major arc PQ at O is reflex angle POQ. In view of the property above and Theorem 9.1, the following result is true: Congruent arcs (or equal arcs) of a circle subtend equal angles at the centre. Therefore, the angle subtended by a chord of a circle at its centre is equal to the angle subtended by the corresponding (minor) arc at the centre. The following theorem gives the relationship between the angles subtended by an arc at the centre and at a point on the circle. Theorem 9.7 : The angle subtended by an arc at the centre is double the angle subtended by it at any point on the remaining part of the circle.

Then ∠ PAQ is also called the angle formed in the segment PAQP. In Theorem 9.7, A can be any point on the remaining part of the circle. So if you take any other point C on the remaining part of the circle (see Fig. 9.16), you have ∠ POQ = 2 ∠ PCQ = 2 ∠ PAQ Therefore, ∠ PCQ = ∠ PAQ. This proves the following: Theorem 9.8 : Angles in the same segment of a circle are equal. Again let us discuss the case (ii) of Theorem 10.8 separately. Here ∠PAQ is an angle in the segment, which is a semicircle. Also, ∠ PAQ = 1 2 ∠ POQ = 1 2 × 180° = 90°. If you take any other point C on the semicircle, again you get that ∠ PCQ = 90° Therefore, you find another property of the circle as: Angle in a semicircle is a right angle. The converse of Theorem 9.8 is also true. It can be stated as: Theorem 9.9 : If a line segment joining two points subtends equal angles at two other points lying on the same side of the line containing the line segment, the four points lie on a circle (i.e. they are concyclic).

Now suppose that we know the lengths of the sides of a scalene triangle and not the height. Can you still find its area? For instance, you have a triangular park whose sides are 40 m, 32 m, and 24 m. How will you calculate its area? Definitely if you want to apply the formula, you will have to calculate its height. But we do not have a clue to calculate the height. Try doing so. If you are not able to get it, then go to the next section. Heron was born in about 10AD possibly in Alexandria in Egypt. He worked in applied mathematics. His works on mathematical and physical subjects are so numerous and varied that he is considered to be an encyclopedic writer in these fields. His geometrical works deal largely with problems on mensuration written in three books. Book I deals with the area of squares, rectangles, triangles, trapezoids (trapezia), various other specialised quadrilaterals, the regular polygons, circles, surfaces of cylinders, cones, spheres etc. In this book, Heron has derived the famous formula for the area of a triangle in terms of its three sides. The formula given by Heron about the area of a triangle, is also known as Hero’s formula. It is stated as: Area of a triangle = ( ) ( ) ( ) s s a s b s c − − − (I) Heron (10 C.E. – 75 C.E.)

Let us take a = 40 m, b = 24 m, c = 32 m, so that we have s = 40 24 32 2 + + m = 48 m. s – a = (48 – 40) m = 8 m, s – b = (48 – 24) m = 24 m, s – c = (48 – 32) m = 16 m.

If each 1 cm2 of the surface of the cob carries an average of four grains, find how many grains you would find on the entire cob. Solution : Since the grains of corn are found only on the curved surface of the corn cob, we would need to know the curved surface area of the corn cob to find the total number of grains on it. In this question, we are given the height of the cone, so we need to find its slant height. Here, l = 2 2 r h + = 2 2 (2.1) 20 + cm = 404.41 cm = 20.11 cm Therefore, the curved surface area of the corn cob = πrl = 22 7 × 2.1 × 20.11 cm2 = 132.726 cm2 = 132.73 cm2 (approx.)

Now if you paste a string along a diameter of a circular disc and rotate it as you had rotated the triangle in the previous section, you see a new solid (see Fig 11.6). What does it resemble? A ball? Yes. It is called a sphere. Fig. 11.6 Reprint 2025-26"}

Of course, it becomes the centre of the sphere. So, a sphere is a three dimensional figure (solid figure), which is made up of all points in the space, which lie at a constant distance called the radius, from a fixed point called the centre of the sphere. Note : A sphere is like the surface of a ball. The word solid sphere is used for the solid whose surface is a sphere. Activity : Have you ever played with a top or have you at least watched someone play with one? You must be aware of how a string is wound around it. Now, let us take a rubber ball and drive a nail into it. Taking support of the nail, let us wind a string around the ball. When you have reached the ‘fullest’ part of the ball, use pins to keep the string in place, and continue to wind the string around the remaining part of the ball, till you have completely covered the ball [see Fig. 11.7(a)]. Mark the starting and finishing points on the string, and slowly unwind the string from the surface of the ball. Now, ask your teacher to help you in measuring the diameter of the ball, from which you easily get its radius. Then on a sheet of paper, draw four circles with radius equal to the radius of the ball. Start filling the circles one by one, with the string you had wound around the ball [see Fig. 11.7(b)]. Fig. 11.7 What have you achieved in all this? The string, which had completely covered the surface area of the sphere, has been used to completely fill the regions of four circles, all of the same radius as of the sphere.

How many faces do you see in the surface of a sphere? There is only one, which is curved. Now, let us take a solid sphere, and slice it exactly ‘through the middle’ with a plane that passes through its centre. What happens to the sphere? Yes, it gets divided into two equal parts (see Fig. 11.8)! What will each half be called? It is called a hemisphere. (Because ‘hemi’ also means ‘half’) And what about the surface of a hemisphere? How many faces does it have? Two! There is a curved face and a flat face (base). The curved surface area of a hemisphere is half the surface area of the sphere, which is 1 2 of 4πr2.

Find the area available to the motorcyclist for riding. Solution : Diameter of the sphere = 7 m. Therefore, radius is 3.5 m.

If the circumference of the base of the dome is 17.6 m, find the cost of painting it, given the cost of painting is ` 5 per 100 cm2. Solution : Since only the rounded surface of the dome is to be painted, we would need to find the curved surface area of the hemisphere to know the extent of painting that needs to be done. Now, circumference of the dome = 17.6 m. Therefore, 17.6 = 2πr.

Fill the cone up to the brim with sand once, and empty it into the cylinder. We find that it fills up only a part of the cylinder [see Fig. 11.12(a)]. When we fill up the cone again to the brim, and empty it into the cylinder, we see that the cylinder is still not full [see Fig. 11.12(b)]. When the cone is filled up for the third time, and emptied into the cylinder, it can be seen that the cylinder is also full to the brim [see Fig. 11.12(c)]. With this, we can safely come to the conclusion that three times the volume of a cone, makes up the volume of a cylinder, which has the same base radius and the same height as the cone, which means that the volume of the cone is one-third the volume of the cylinder. So, Volume of a Cone = 1 3 πr2h where r is the base radius and h is the height of the cone. Example 8 : The height and the slant height of a cone are 21 cm and 28 cm respectively.

Assuming that all the stitching margins and the wastage incurred while cutting, amounts to approximately 1 m2, find the volume of the tent that can be made with it. Solution : Since the area of the canvas = 551 m2 and area of the canvas lost in wastage is 1 m2, therefore the area of canvas available for making the tent is (551 – 1) m2 = 550 m2. Now, the surface area of the tent = 550 m2 and the required base radius of the conical tent = 7 m Note that a tent has only a curved surface (the floor of a tent is not covered by canvas!!).

First, take two or three spheres of different radii, and a container big enough to be able to put each of the spheres into it, one at a time. Also, take a large trough in which you can place the container. Then, fill the container up to the brim with water [see Fig. 11.13(a)]. Now, carefully place one of the spheres in the container. Some of the water from the container will over flow into the trough in which it is kept [see Fig. 11.13(b)]. Carefully pour out the water from the trough into a measuring cylinder (i.e., a graduated cylindrical jar) and measure the water over flowed [see Fig. 11.13(c)]. Suppose the radius of the immersed sphere is r (you can find the radius by measuring the diameter of the sphere). Then evaluate 4 3 πr3. Do you find this value almost equal to the measure of the volume over flowed? Fig. 11.13 Once again repeat the procedure done just now, with a different size of sphere. Find the radius R of this sphere and then calculate the value of 3 4 R . 3 π Once again this value is nearly equal to the measure of the volume of the water displaced (over flowed) by the sphere. What does this tell us? We know that the volume of the sphere is the same as the measure of the volume of the water displaced by it. By doing this experiment repeatedly with spheres of varying radii, we are getting the same result, namely, the volume of a sphere is equal to 4 3 π times the cube of its radius. This gives us the idea that Volume of a Sphere = 3 4 3 r π where r is the radius of the sphere. Later, in higher classes it can be proved also. But at this stage, we will just take it as true.

Usually comparisons among the individual items are best shown by means of graphs. The representation then becomes easier to understand than the actual data.

Here we shall discuss them through a more formal approach. Recall that a bar graph is a pictorial representation of data in which usually bars of uniform width are drawn with equal spacing between them on one axis (say, the x-axis), depicting the variable. The values of the variable are shown on the other axis (say, the y-axis) and the heights of the bars depend on the values of the variable.

This is called a histogram, which is a graphical representation of a grouped frequency distribution with continuous classes. Also, unlike a bar graph, the width of the bar plays a significant role in its construction. Here, in fact, areas of the rectangles erected are proportional to the corresponding frequencies. However, since the widths of the rectangles are all equal, the lengths of the rectangles are proportional to the frequencies. That is why, we draw the lengths according to (iii) above. Now, consider a situation different from the one above. Example 3 : A teacher wanted to analyse the performance of two sections of students in a mathematics test of 100 marks. Looking at their performances, she found that a few students got under 20 marks and a few got 70 marks or above. So she decided to group them into intervals of varying sizes as follows: 0 - 20, 20 - 30, . . ., 60 - 70, 70 - 100. Then she formed the following table: Reprint 2025-26"}

Fig. 12.4 Carefully examine this graphical representation. Do you think that it correctly represents the data? No, the graph is giving us a misleading picture. As we have mentioned earlier, the areas of the rectangles are proportional to the frequencies in a histogram. Earlier this problem did not arise, because the widths of all the rectangles were equal.

For example, it shows a greater frequency in the interval 70 - 100, than in 60 - 70, which is not the case. So, we need to make certain modifications in the lengths of the rectangles so that the areas are again proportional to the frequencies. The steps to be followed are as given below: 1. Select a class interval with the minimum class size. In the example above, the minimum class-size is 10. 2. The lengths of the rectangles are then modified to be proportionate to the class-size 10. For instance, when the class-size is 20, the length of the rectangle is 7. So when the class-size is 10, the length of the rectangle will be 7 20 × 10 = 3.5. Similarly, proceeding in this manner, we get the following table: Table 12.4 Marks Frequency Width of Length of the rectangle the class 0 - 20 7 20 7 20 × 10 = 3.5 20 - 30 10 10 10 10 × 10 = 10 30 - 40 10 10 10 10 × 10 = 10 40 - 50 20 10 20 10 × 10 = 20 50 - 60 20 10 20 10 × 10 = 20 60 - 70 15 10 15 10 × 10 = 15 70 - 100 8 30 8 30 × 10 = 2.67 Reprint 2025-26"}

So, the correct histogram with varying width is given in Fig. 12.5. Fig. 12.5 (C) Frequency Polygon There is yet another visual way of representing quantitative data and its frequencies. This is a polygon. To see what we mean, consider the histogram represented by Fig. 12.3. Let us join the mid-points of the upper sides of the adjacent rectangles of this histogram by means of line segments. Let us call these mid-points B, C, D, E, F and G. When joined by line segments, we obtain the figure BCDEFG (see Fig. 12.6). To complete the polygon, we assume that there is a class interval with frequency zero Reprint 2025-26"}

So, to find the class preceeding 0-10, we extend the horizontal axis in the negative direction and find the mid-point of the imaginary class-interval (–10) - 0. The first end point, i.e., B is joined to this mid-point with zero frequency on the negative direction of the horizontal axis. The point where this line segment meets the vertical axis is marked as A. Let L be the mid-point of the class succeeding the last class of the given data.

For this, we require the mid-points of the class-intervals used in the data. These mid-points of the class-intervals are called class-marks. To find the class-mark of a class interval, we find the sum of the upper limit and lower limit of a class and divide it by 2. Thus, Class-mark = Upper limit + Lower limit 2 Let us consider an example.
