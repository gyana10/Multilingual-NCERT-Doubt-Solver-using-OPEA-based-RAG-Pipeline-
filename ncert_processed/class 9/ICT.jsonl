ICT has literally made inroads into almost all major disciplines across science, social sciences, languages, arts and medicine, etc. It has the potential to create newer avenues for employment, help us communicate and collaborate better, learn, and understand the nature and phenomena as well as improve our skills and standards of living. Policymakers across the globe today agree with the potential of ICT in the teaching-learning process and recommend ICT to be a part of school and teacher education curriculum. Rapid advancements in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) have created unprecedented opportunities in the field of education and school education in particular. Mastering ICT skills and utilising ICT is of utmost importance for teachers and learners for creating a new learning culture. ICT is stated to have motivational power. It enables students to enjoy learning as an active participant, such as by bringing the outside world into the classroom or by enhancing one‑to‑one, one-to-many and many-to- many interaction, among peers, teachers, experts and others. Furthermore, ICT has also helped the students in learning new skills, such as searching and locating appropriate information, making informed choices, learning to recognise the authenticity of sources and collaborating with other learners. Today, we are living in an interconnected world where ICT-based applications influence the way we learn, communicate, commute or even socialise. Developments in the twenty‑first century skills, such as communication, creative and critical thinking, problem solving, collaborative learning, etc., are essential at the school level. ICT plays a key role in developing these skills. This book aims to introduce the world of ICT and its applications. It will help students to learn, prepare, present and communicate their thoughts, ideas and content through various digital formats, i.e., text, image, audio and video, etc. The book will also help students to understand the potential of Internet as well as the safety and security issues related to it, and the ways in which one can safeguard themselves against malicious activities and incidents happening in the cyber world.

Also understanding the basics of ICT and mastering the skills is essential and must be regarded as a core part of education, along with reading, writing and numeracy. The recent efforts of the Government of India (GoI) seeks to deepen the use of ICT in almost every sphere of life. The Digital India Campaign (2015) strives to transform India into a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy by focussing on three vision areas — Digital Infrastructure as Core Utility to Every Citizen, e-Governance and Service on Demand and Digital Literacy and Empowerment of Citizens. The three cardinal principals of the draft New National Education Policy (2016) viz., access, equity and quality could be served well by harnessing the huge potential of ICT. The National Curriculum Framework (2005) recommends to recognise that given the space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. The curricula for ICT in education lays an emphasis on empowering the students in a way so that they may get an access to a variety of resources, learn to critically appraise information and resources, and make safe, productive, ethical and legal use of resources. The Present Class IX Textbook of ICT takes into account goals of the New Education Policy, the recommendations of National Curriculum Framework (2005), the Curricula for ICT in Education and visions of Digital India Campaign (2015). This textbook is an attempt to foster creativity, problem solving and to introduce students to the world of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), which may also shape their future career pursuits. The textbook contains eight chapters under four learning strands viz. 'Connecting with the World', 'Connecting with Each Other', 'Creating with ICT' and 'Interacting with ICT'. It has been carefully designed with meticulous efforts of the Textbook Development Team comprising School teachers, subject experts, academicians and technical experts from government, non-government and private entities. Some of the members worked at the advisory level while others contributed towards the actual development activity as core team members and members of the textbook development committee. It is hoped that the students will appreciate the immense potential of ICT and will be encouraged to explore and learn further.

The weight of the ball in every medium was noted by Muskan in her notebook. The weight was found to be least in water and comparatively higher in air than in mustard oil. Muskan recorded the entire experiment as a video, explaining about the variation of weight in various medium. Muskan shared this video with her classmates using a Messenger App. One of her friends suggested her to create a blog to share her experiences. Muskan created a blog and regularly shared her learning experiences and reflections on this blog. She also uses web tools and technology that made her learning experience very engaging. Muskan is excited about the potential of technology use for learning. This is only an example to describe how Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has started influencing the learning experiences. With the world becoming more and more digital with time, schools are also progressing in their use of ICT.

For example, Muskan is a student of Class IX of the Government School, Tajpur. She is 14 years old and is a Table Tennis player. Her hobbies include singing, drawing, reading, dancing, gardening, etc. This is the description about Muskan available in her profile at school. Based on this information, Muskan's teacher selected her to participate in an inter‑school poster making competition‑on “Dance forms of India”. Thus information (meaningful data) can help in decision‑making also. The term communication may be referred as imparting or exchanging of information by speaking, writing, or using some other medium. In other words, it may be referred as conveying your feelings, thoughts and emotions in any verbal and non-verbal medium. Any communication has four essential elements, namely ‘sender’, ‘message’, ‘medium’ and ‘receiver’. When all four elements are in sync with each other in terms of sequence, relevance, appropriateness, etc., then communication becomes effective. Analyse the elements of communication followed when Muskan shared the video of experiment she recorded.

For example, Muskan went to an excursion to Bhubaneswar and visited the State Museum. She saw various mineral ores in the mineral section of the museum. She decided to capture photographs to share with others who may not have seen the ores. She borrowed her teacher’s mobile and clicked pictures of the rare collection. She shared all the pictures on her blog along with a description of the ores. Many viewers commented and appreciated Muskan for sharing those pictures and description. Technology can be used for creation and communication of information. The term Information and Communication Technology (ICT) includes various forms of technologies that are used to create, display, store, process, transmit, share or exchange information by electronic means (UNESCO 2007). Such a discipline which deals in the creation and communication of information is called ICT (see Fig.1.2).

In addition to printed newspapers now we also have their electronic versions. Along with traditional radio, we also have online radio. Evolution of ICT We cannot live in isolation. We need to interact and communicate with each other and with our surroundings. In the ancient times people used smoke signals, drum sounds, pigeons and messengers as modes of communication. These were relatively slow, unreliable and sometimes unsafe means of communication. With the advent of new technologies, the modes and methods of communication are changing very fast. Radio, television, computers, telephones, smartphones, digital camera, laptop and interactive board have revolutionised the ways of communication. These are very fast and can link distant locations within no time. We can easily send messages across the globe and learn about events all over the world in a blink of eye. Numerous technological tools have come up which help us not only to communicate but to create, store and manage information. The diverse set of technological tools and resources used to store, manage, manipulate, create and communicate digital information come under information and communication technologies (ICTs).

It has become easier to communicate worldwide through the use of ICTs, for example, social media sites and apps, blogs, wikispace, etc. The use of ICT is time saving and cost effective in various ways. ICT has revolutionised the world. There was a generation that did not have telephone; there was a time when radio and television were considered as the most advanced sources of information. However now the new generation lives in the world of Internet, wireless, augmented and virtual space. The world around has drastically changed. The dramatic change due to ICT has resulted in innovation in every field. These innovations have reduced the size of the technological tools and increased the speed with which they operate to process data and communicate information. All these advancements and innovations give scope for betterment and effectiveness. Muskan has a cousin Nishi who lives in Bengaluru and who is also of her age. She has same hobbies like her, such as dancing and gardening. Both of them are very fond of each other. They like to talk very often, they discuss about new things they do in gardening for hours together over phone. But making phone calls frequently was very costly and unaffordable for them. Hence they always had to restrict their discussions on gardening. A friend of Muskan informed her about online video calling facility like Skype, Google Meet, etc., which is more cost effective than making, phone calls. Muskan installed Skype on her laptop and her cousin also installed it on her Smartphone. They are now able to discuss on several topics without any restriction. • Access to instant data: Access to instant data supports in predictions, decision making and also knowledge acquisition.

While packing, her mother was a little confused about carrying woollen clothes as she was unaware of the temperature in Mount Abu. Knowledge about ICT helped Muskan to help her mother. She checked the temperature in Mount Abu during the past few days from meteorological website. As the recorded temperature showed a higher temperature for past 15 days, she informed her mother to carry more semi woolen clothes. Instant access to data helped them to reduce the luggage and have a pleasant journey with required preparedness. ● Creation of information for communication: ICTs can be used to create communication pieces in various forms like text, image, audio, video, multimedia, etc. Once the information is in digital form it can be used for recreating resources out of the original. Digital information is also easy to modify and share. Muskan’s cousin Nishi visited a historical place ‘Hampi’ in Karnataka. When she saw the beauty of the architecture she thought of sharing it with Muskan. Nishi decides to show Muskan the archeological site through Skype, but her father suggested her to share it through Facebook live so that not only Muskan but her other friends can also see her exploration. As the mobile had a 4G network, the speed of the Internet supported online streaming. This act of Nishi helped Muskan to have a virtual trip to Hampi. She thought for a while and found a solution to make a great resource about Hampi that can be shared with others. So she downloaded the video shared by Nishi. Using a video editor, she edited the unwanted content, added a background music and shared it with her schoolmates who never saw Hampi. The knowledge of ICT helped in capturing the events Muskan herself had never seen and sharing them through online streaming. ● Store and organise: ICT helps in organising information in various forms.

Muskan's grandfather had a great collection of postage stamps. He gifted his collection to Muskan on her birthday. She was thrilled to get this collection but she observed that the collection compiled in an album will perish over time. She decides to give the collection a lasting life by converting it into a digital collection. She along with her brother scanned all the stamps and added tags like country to which they belonged, date of release, event, personality, phenomenon depicted on the stamp, etc. This digital storing and organising helped her to retrieve any stamp whenever she require and also to easily maintain the record. ● Scope for learning: ICT provides a great opportunity to learn. One can learn anytime, anywhere and at his or her own pace. We can also create our own personal learning environment. Availability of online courses, e-tutorials have opened up avenues for continuous and life‑long learning. Muskan used to visit her grandmother's place for every summer vacation, but this summer her parents were busy with some work. She could not visit her grandmother. She was very sad and did not know what to do during her summer vacations. Hasmukh, a friend, suggested her to do an online course on Puppetry. He sent her information about this free course. When she further searched about the course she found it to be a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC). As she was not aware of MOOC, she searched for information about MOOC and learnt that MOOCs are free online courses that can be taken up by anyone at anytime from anywhere. Muskan joined the course immediately and started learning different puppet‑making techniques as well as storytelling using puppets. She enjoyed the online course on puppetry and planned to do a puppet show in her class as a holiday project once the school reopens. ● Plan and manage : Use of ICT tools can help in time management by scheduling the works across devices and using various features like alerts, priorities, Reprint 2025-26"}

By now, you must have understood the importance of instructions and the sequence of instructions to complete a particular task. To accomplish a task and to get the desired output, you have to mention each instruction clearly, sequentially and logically, as shown in Fig. 8.1. So to achieve a task, the steps are listed below. 1. Clearly identify the output that you want. 2. Analyse the instructions required to find a solution to get the desired output. 3. Finalise and give instructions in the proper sequence. 4. Verify whether the output produced is as desired by you in Step 1. Reprint 2025-26"}

Step 1: Move forward by 10 steps. Step 2: Turn right by 90 degrees Have you given the right instructions? Will Twirly cat reach its home? Can you check the given instructions using any software application or tool? Yes, you can do so by using the Scratch application. Using this application you can create your own stories, games and various other animations using simple drag and drop instructions. Animations in Scratch can be created offline as well as online mode. As it is an open source software you can download it from https://scratch.mit.edu , install it on your computer and then use it. You can also create and share your animations online using the above URL. On opening Scratch, you see the interface as shown in Fig. 8.3. Each object on the scratch window is called a sprite. This object can be any person, an animal, an automobile, a building or even text. After learning about the Scratch interface let us now verify the steps that would take out Twirly cat home.

You can even create an animated story using various characters (sprites), instructions and tools using Scratch. Have you ever thought that instructions have to be given in a logical sequence to communicate your ideas too? In the previous chapters, you have learnt to communicate your ideas through text, images, video and audio using various tools and applications. The audio and video tools helped you to communicate with realistic images and videos. But what if you had an imaginary concept or story to communicate with your friends? Such a story may not have any realistic character. For example, a fairy tale or a story of two animals going on a space voyage or two fishes talking in water. Can that be done using any text editing, image editing or presentation tool? Let us create a story where the underwater animals are talking about water pollution. Our imaginary characters will be a star fish named Twinkle, an octopus named Octi, a whale named Blue and a fish named Laali. In our story we need the following objects: • Underwater background • Octi, an octopus • Twinkle, a starfish • Blue, a whale • Laali, a fish • Text in the form of dialogues or messages • Sound of cough • Sound of water drops and ripples Reprint 2025-26"}
