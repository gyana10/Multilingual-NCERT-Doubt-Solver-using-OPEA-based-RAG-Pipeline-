The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured the students’ inherent abilities and touching upon all the five planes of human existence, the pañchakośhas, in the Foundational and the Preparatory Stages have paved the way for the progression of their learning further at the Middle Stage. Thus, the Middle Stage acts as a bridge between the Preparatory and the Secondary Stages, spanning three years from Grade 6 to 8. The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages, including at least two languages native to India, Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education, promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy— a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establishing conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks.

Its content comprises projects related to three work forms— life forms, machines and materials, and human services. The projects will help students to develop knowledge, skills, attitude and values alongside ecological sensitivity, gender sensitivity, digital skills, and life skills. For all practical purposes, it has, to my mind, succeeded in its curricular goals: first, to foster natural curiosity among students through a proper selection of project; and second, develop among them the core competencies, such as communication, creativity, critical thinking and green skill and vocational skills, such as application of tools, and procedures for design and developing products by intelligently designing various activities, thereby seamlessly integrating content and pedagogy within meaningful contexts. However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries, laboratories and workshops play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this activity book and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years. \b Dinesh Prasad Saklani Director New Delhi National Council of Educational July, 2024 Research and Training Reprint 2025-26"}

In the National Curriculum Framework 2023 (NCF-SE 2023), work has been categorised under three broad forms: work with life forms, work with machines and materials, and work in human services. The intent at this stage is to provide vocational exposure to the students through a wide range of activities categorised into three forms of work. To achieve this, students are expected to take up nine projects across Grades 6 to 8, i.e., three projects in each Grade and one from each form of work. The textual material developed for the Middle Stage will take children well beyond the Preparatory Stage. Curricular goals, competencies, and learning outcomes have been the guiding principles while developing the textbook. The following Curricular Goals (CG) given in the activity book cover a range of competencies. CG-1: Develops in-depth basic skills and allied knowledge of work and their associated materials or procedures; CG-2: Understands the place and usefulness of vocational skills and vocations in the world of work; CG-3: Develops essential values while working across areas; and CG-4: Develops basic skills and allied knowledge to run and contribute to a home. A variety of activities have been included in the Activity Book to cover the above curricular goals. The Activity Book contains six illustrative projects, two for each form of work. One project maybe taken up by students or preferably, the school can design other projects based on local considerations. The illustrative projects are described as follows: Project 1 is on developing a School Kitchen Garden. Students will engage in creating and maintaining a kitchen garden on school grounds or in pots.

In the NCF-SE 2023, work has been categorised in three broad forms: Work with Life Forms, Work with Machines and Materials, and Work in Human Services. • Work with Life Forms involves working with plants and animals. For example, developing a vegetable garden and taking care of animals. • Work with Machines and Materials involves working with materials (such as, paper, wood, clay and fabric) and using basic tools (such as, scissors and garden fork, knife, hammer, screwdriver, etc.) and machines (such as, bottle opener, ramp slide, wood screw, crane, bulldozer, etc.) • Work in Human Services involves interaction with people to understand their needs and how we can help them. It involves communication and understanding the processes and resources for providing a particular service. For example, healthcare, social services, education, food services, community service, etc. These ‘Forms of Work’ act as a guiding concept for developing the curriculum, syllabus and materials for the Middle Stage (Grades 6 to 8). The intent at this stage is to provide students exposure to a wide range of work. To achieve this, students are required to take up nine projects across Grades 6 to 8: three projects, one from each form of work, in each Grade. The choice of projects is left entirely to schools. The NCF-SE 2023, and indeed this Activity Book, encourages schools to select projects based on local considerations and availability of resources. Two examples each of projects from the Forms of Work that students can take up in Grade 6 are detailed in the Activity Book. It must be emphasised that these examples are meant to serve as illustrations of how projects can be designed and the key aspects that must be addressed. To this end, a template for designing a project other than the examples has also been provided in the Activity Book (Annexure 1). Reprint 2025-26"}

Smooth introduction to Vocational Education: This is the first time that Vocational Education will be introduced in the Middle Stage. The Activity Book must aim to make this transition as smooth as possible without prescribing to either the teacher or the student. 2. Illustrations of projects requiring varied resources: The Activity Book must illustrate projects that can be taken up by schools with different kinds of resources in terms of availability of experts as well as tools and materials. 3. Alignment to learning outcomes: The Activity Book must be designed to ensure attainment of the learning outcomes for Grade 6 and eventually the competencies for the Middle Stage. 4. Consistency across projects: The same format must be followed across all projects. This will ensure that each project presents a familiar sequence and outcomes. 5. Coherence within projects: While projects will comprise various activities, all these activities must lead to learning how to ‘do’ something. In other words, the activities must be linked and lead to progression of learning. 6. Ownership of students: The Activity Book must ‘speak’ to students. It must also give them opportunities to record their own learning and reflection based on the activities they will take up. 7. Guidance for teachers: The Activity Book must provide a framework for teachers who will be taking up Vocational Education for the first time. It must guide them in their expectations from students. It must also guide them to understand what is expected from them in the NCF-SE 2023. 8. Value integration: The Activity Book must offer students opportunities to ‘do’ different things, record small successes, take and give feedback, work with peers, try and re-try, answer questions, reflect, in short, and ‘experience’ the values related to work. 9. Approach of conducting projects: The focus must be on ‘doing’ with some element of preparation, and recording and reflections. Learning should emerge from the process of doing the activities. To this end, as far as possible, the initial activities must be rooted in what students are doing at present and what they can easily observe around themselves. Reprint 2025-26"}

The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 introduces Vocational Education as a distinct subject starting in Grade 6. The purpose of this subject is to promote ‘learning by doing’, ‘dignity of labour’, and the development of vocational capacities through exposure to a wide range of work. Successful implementation will aid in developing responsible and confident adults who value all professions. Vocational Education in schools also offers a robust medium for holistic learning by offering students opportunities to apply conceptual learning in other curricular areas to real-life situations. In Grade 6, students will take up one project in each of the ‘Forms of Work’. The sequence of these projects is not important, so long as all the projects are completed within the academic year. These projects can be taken up at the same time or one after the other. Groups of students may also take up different projects, which depends on the nature of the project and other factors, such as the number of students, resources available, and so on. Please note that it is important to identify concepts across curricular areas that students need to know (e.g., life cycle of plants and biodiversity in the project on Life Forms) and ensure that they have been covered before starting the project. In this Activity Book, the projects are designed as per the Learning Outcomes for Vocational Education in Grade 6. The focus is on the following: 1. Using physical tools/equipment for carrying out different processes to perform authentic tasks. 2. Gaining clarity about what is to be done and reaching the final outcome through breaking down the task into smaller activities. 3. Understanding how to prepare materials and use tools and equipment, while following safety measures and protocols. 4. Connecting the activities done in school to the world of work. 5. Assessing work done in terms of quantity and quality. 6. Applying what is learnt in school to daily life. 7. Working collaboratively in groups while ensuring individual participation in each activity. Reprint 2025-26"}
{"class": "class 6", "subject": "vocational education", "page_no": 18, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "xviii In doing the above, students will be able to develop values related to work, particularly respect for all work. They will realise the importance of the dignity of labour, which means that no work is considered superior and therefore, no work or person should be discriminated against on any basis. Pedagogy and Assessment Projects comprise a set of activities that are generally expected to be completed in a group or individually, as required. Resources for projects (e.g., tools, equipment, materials, use of workspaces, etc.) and resource persons or master instructors (e.g., mechanics, farmers, craftspersons, artisans, persons working in technology, and experts in the field) must be drawn from the community. Exposure visits and interactions with professionals are built into the project to enable students to observe and understand work in real settings. The total time allotted to Vocational Education is 110 hours or 165 periods in one academic year, excluding time for assessment, school events, bagless days and similar activities (Section 4.3 of the NCF-SE 2023). These periods may be distributed across the week as two blocks of two periods on weekdays and one period on Saturday. Each project is expected to be completed in about 30 hours (approximately 55 periods of 40 minutes each). This duration is to ensure a long-term engagement that allows students to complete a set of interrelated activities. It also gives them time for trial and error, to try out things differently, and to extend their learning into other activities. The focus of the projects must be creativity and demonstration of skills, and the process of ‘doing’ rather than the ‘product’ or outcome. Working in groups and observing people with expertise is important to foster an appreciation for teamwork, creativity, sensitivity, persistence, and other important values related to work. Students must be active throughout, as they take up activities that are directly connected to real life and the world of work. They must be able to integrate learning from other curricular areas into the projects. Prevalent biases must be addressed, for example, by not assigning specific work roles to a particular gender or to students from a specific social groups. All students must participate in all activities. To ensure the participation of students with disabilities, projects can be adapted or an entirely different project maybe developed.

{"class": "class 6", "subject": "vocational education", "page_no": 19, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "xix The Activity Book is designed to enable continuous assessment by teachers, as well as self and peer-assessment by students. The questions and formats for recording require students to assess their own progress, share their learning and reflections, and record their answers as they move from one activity to the next. Students must also maintain a portfolio in order to help them see their own progress, and record the processes and products related to the projects. It may contain any work done by students, including additional notes, presentations, sketches or photographs (besides those in the Activity Book) related to the project, and products they have created. Students can be continuously assessed by observing them during activities, asking them questions, and reviewing their Activity Books. Assessing the inculcation of values related to work (e.g., initiative, persistence and focus, responsibility, discipline, eye for detail, curiosity and creativity, empathy and sensitivity, and willingness to do physical work) is particularly important. Students must be observed while at work to assess the same. Checklists and rubrics that outline specific behaviours and attitudes related to work values may be developed by the teachers. Annexure 2 contains the competencies to be developed across the Middle Stage and the learning outcomes to be achieved in Grade 6. While this is true for all subjects, the role of feedback is particularly important in Vocational Education. Students must be encouraged and motivated by recognition of their work and their creativity. This approach ensures that all students are able to complete their work successfully through ongoing guidance, which in turn is motivating. Summative assessment for Grade 6 can, for example, comprise a viva voce, presentation, role play, simulation, group discussion, presentations, and the review of students’ responses to prompts or questions in the Activity Book. If you wish to use a paper-pencil test, it could include situational questions, concept maps, flowcharts, questions related to learning from visits, and Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs). Each project also has a set of questions in the last section. These questions address key aspects of learning and concepts that are strengthened while doing the activities.

Therefore, any project other than those in the Activity Book must include the same components. An illustrative list of projects is given in Annexure 3. The projects in this Activity Book are not mandatory, therefore schools are free to choose any one of these from each form of work or design an entirely different project. Students must also be encouraged to come up with ideas for projects. If you and the students decide to choose a project other than those in the Activity Book, the following must be kept in mind for all the Forms of Work: 1. Is the project appropriate for students in Grade 6? 2. Does the project helps students use learning from other subjects? 3. Is the project related to the work the students see around them? 4. Will the students be able to interact with persons who are experts in the work related to the project? 5. Will the students be able to get hands-on experience? 6.

Another new and exciting subject that you will study is Vocational Education. Vocational Education will help you learn about different kinds of work and how to ‘do’ work yourself. When you think about work, you must remember two things: (i) all work is important, and (ii) people work not only to make a living, but also to make life more joyful and interesting. In daily life, you see people doing various kinds of work. Some of the work is related to running a household while some is related to earning a living. Vocational Education prepares you to deal with practical things related to daily life and understand the world of work. This will happen through projects that you will do in school. These projects will give you an opportunity to work with your hands, work in groups with your peers, and learn the skills which help you become self-dependent in life. How to use the Activity Book? Read through the introduction of the project to get an idea of what you will be doing. Materials Needed Gather all the materials listed at the beginning of each activity. Follow the Steps 1. Each activity has clear, numbered steps. Follow them to complete each task. Take your time and make sure you understand each step before moving on. Take notes during field visits or interaction with experts. 2. Complete all the questions and tables given in the Activity Book, this will help you to both learn and check your understanding.

Discuss your observations with your peers and teacher, and write about what you learnt about growing plants after your visit. Did you know? The science of agriculture and plant life was given a lot of importance in ancient Bharat as the main work was farming and the rearing of animals. The distilled wisdom and experience related to plant health, growth and treatment of diseases was documented in a treatise called ‘Vrikshayurveda’ (Ayurveda for trees). There were two texts by the same name of Vrikshayurveda, one written by Salihotra (approximately 400 BCE) and the second one by Surapala (1000 CE). The only existing copy of a palm leaf manuscript of Surapala’s Vrikshayurveda is preserved at Oxford University. The text deals with the cultivation of many species of plants, water management, soil conservation, fertilisers, various diseases affecting plants and their treatment. In the Vrikshayurveda, Surapala encourages the planting of sacred trees like Bilva (Bael or stone apple), Nyagrodha (banyan), Ashwattha (fig) and Neem. The text says that planting trees is one of the means to attain the goals of human life. Climate change, soil erosion and increasing health concerns have led to renewed interest in the traditional knowledge contained in texts like Vrikshayurveda. This knowledge can be used to maintain the health of the soil, promote good agricultural practices and preserve biodiversity. Reprint 2025-26"}

Plants need nutrients to grow. Nutrients refer to specific elements, such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potash that plants absorb from the soil or growth medium for their growth and development. Organic fertilisers, such as manure, compost, vermicompost and green manure and inorganic fertilisers, such as urea and superphosphate are applied to the plants for supplying nutrients. You can consider planting herbs or leafy vegetables that grow quickly. For example, you can grow herbs, like coriander, mint, spinach or leafy vegetables so that you can use the produce from your garden soon. These herbs and leafy vegetables are also very good for health as they are good source of vitamins and minerals. Now, select the plants for your kitchen garden and get the seeds or seedlings for sowing or planting. Activity 3: Making vermicompost In this activity, you will learn how to make vermicompost. There are many methods of preparing vermicompost. One such method is described below. You can also search for other methods on the Internet or ask farmers and other experts for advice. 1. Vermicompost is prepared in a bin made of plastic, wood or any other water-resistant material. The bin must be covered with tarpaulin or piece of old thick cloth. Holes must be made in its bottom to drain out extra water. 2. The compost bin should be filled with waste, such as kitchen waste, fallen leaves and other garden waste or any Reprint 2025-26"}

Red earthworms (Eisenia fetida) should be introduced on top of the bedding material and allowed to burrow into it (Figure 1.7a). You can get them from a farm or nursery. 5. The earthworms must be fed by adding kitchen scraps, such as fruit and vegetable peelings, coffee grounds, eggshells, and non-greasy food waste to the bin. Avoid adding meat, dairy or oily foods, and citrus fruits, as they can attract pests or harm the worms. 6. The bedding should be kept moist by spraying it with water as needed, but not waterlogged. It should be covered with a lid to retain moisture and prevent pests. 7. Vermicompost from the bottom of the bin can be used once it becomes dark, crumbly, and earthy smelling, which usually happen within a few months (Figure 1.7b).

You can also use farm seeds preserved from the previous harvest by farmers or gardeners, in which case please ask them for guidance. If you are transplanting seedlings, read any labels or tags that came with them for specific care instructions. If labels or tags are not available, ask the person who gave you the seedlings for guidance. 1. Sowing Seeds Sow seeds as per the sequence below: (a) Make furrows or small holes in the soil according to the recommended spacing for sowing the seeds. If you are making your kitchen garden in pots, you will have to know the number of seeds or seedlings to be placed in each pot. The number of seeds or seedlings to be placed in each pot is decided by certain factors, including the type of plant, the size of pot and the desired plant growth. (b) Drop seeds into the furrows or holes. If the seeds are very small, sprinkle them evenly over the soil surface (Figure 1.9).

Steps for Plant Care and Maintenance (a) Support your plants and creepers by staking: Staking plants is a common practice to provide support and stability, especially for tall or weak stem plants that may otherwise become top-heavy and fall over (Figure 1.11). Plants, such as tomatoes, cucumbers, peas and beans require staking. First, you will need ‘stakes’. You can use bamboo, a thin old branch that has fallen off a tree, or an old metal or plastic pipe as a stake. The height and thickness of the stake should be decided according to the length and weight of the plant. Now, using a string tie the plant with the stake.

Decide how the plants will be watered. You can use, a mug and bucket, watering can, or a pipe or something else (Figure 1.12). Develop a schedule to ensure plants receive sufficient water, especially during dry spells. New plants need more frequent watering. Water the plants in early morning or late afternoon to minimise water loss due to evaporation.

It is good to use a hand, cultivator, if you have one for weeding. You can ask your teacher for an alternative, if hand cultivator is not available. Figure 1.13: Removing weeds in a plant bed using hand cultivator 1. Take 500 gram of neem leaves (if possible, you can ask an expert at the local Krishi Vigyan Kendra or Agriculture Research Centre to recommend any other bitter plant leaves), wash them and chop or break them into smaller pieces. You will experience a nice fragrance as the leaves are broken up. 2. Mix the neem leaves with 5 litres of water. 3. Put the mixture in a jerry can/large size bottle and leave it for around 14 days. 4. Separate suspended solids from liquid using a strainer. 5. You can spray this pesticide on your plants using a spray bottle. Decorate Your Garden Your garden must look beautiful with plants growing neatly in rows and with proper layout and decoration. Think of ways in which you can beautify your garden and act on them. Some things you can do to decorate your kitchen garden are as follows: 1. Use stones to make the flower beds or pots look neat. You can paint these stones using attractive colours. 2. Make decorative items that can be kept outside in the garden, like painted clay pots, paintings made on stones, or using old objects lying around the school to make ‘sculptures’. 3. You can even make a scarecrow to keep the garden safe from birds.

You must ask your teacher about the method to harvest produce. For example, for leafy greens, such as lettuce and spinach, use a cut-and-come-again approach, harvesting outer leaves while allowing the inner leaves to continue growing. For root vegetables, like carrots and radishes, gently loosen the soil around the base of the plant and pull them out by hand or with the help of a garden trowel. For produce like tomatoes, brinjals (Figure 1.16) and peppers, use gardening shears to cut them from the vine, leaving a short stem attached. Remove any debris, foreign matter, or produce that is damaged to ensure only the best-quality is retained.

It includes plants, animals, birds, fish, insects, and even microorganisms that are found everywhere, including soil (see Figure 2.1). You have learnt about the diversity of living things around us in Science. A biodiversity register is used for documenting the diversity of living things in an area. It contains information about habitat, which includes the landscape and types of soil, scientific and local names of living things, what animals eat, living things that may harm others, and other different kinds of information. Recording biodiversity is crucial because as habitats transform due to factors, such as land clearance for construction or agriculture, or shifts in climate, many species face extinction or become endangered. This interconnectedness means that the loss of any plant or species affects the ecosystems, including humans. Biodiversity registers also provide people with information that is useful, for example, local knowledge related to crop plants and animals, plants that can be used for their medicinal value, pests that affect plants, when to plant crops, and so on. You can create your own ‘mini’ biodiversity register by systematically recording the biodiversity around yourself. In case you come across a plant, insect, bird or animal that you are not familiar with, then you can get information by: i. Talking to teachers/elders/family members/experts ii. Looking up books in the library iii. Searching for the information with the help of the Internet on the computer iv. Using applications on mobile phones.

Cropping season: It is the season in which a particular crop is grown. Season of fruiting: This refers to the season when fruit trees produce fruits. Source of seeds/plants: This refers to how new plants grow, whether from seeds, seedlings, bulbs, stem cuttings or any other method. Affected crop: Crop that had been damaged by pests, e.g., diseases that affect plants, insects that eat the leaves or fruits, or any other reason. Host: It is a plant or animal on which other plants or animals live. For example, dogs are hosts for fleas, who suck their blood, and some plants are hosts for caterpillars, who grow by eating leaves and fruits. Pests: These are insects, birds or animals that are harmful to plants. Pesticide: Pesticides are used to prevent or control harm to hosts by pests. They can be in the form of liquid, solid or gases. Weedicide: Weedicides are used to prevent or control harm to plants by weeds. GI tag: A Geographical Indication (GI) tag is given by the government and recognised all over the world. For plants, it means that the plant is grown in a specific geography and all the produce from that area is of a high standard.

We use doorknobs, and open and close doors and windows without thinking. But how do these things work? All these things have simple machines in them. For example, wheel and axle and pulleys are simple machines. Simple machines help to make our work easier. They help us to do things beyond our capacity, which are difficult or simply not possible. For example, can we lift heavy loads or break wood with our hands? A cart with wheels and axle can move very heavy objects with less force. Pulleys can lift heavy objects. Do you know that even a big bus is actually made up of many interconnected small machines? And that the simple machines used in a bus are also used in bicycles and toys, and doors and windows? Yes! It is true that they are made up of simple machines. Look at Figure 3.2 below and discuss what else simple machines can do.

You may also have seen ‘animation’ films and ‘animojis’ (animated emojis) on your smartphone. You might have wondered how these games, animojis or videos of moving figures (both humans and animals) and objects are made. People called ‘programmers’ use something called ‘coding’ to do this. This project will help you create your own online games and animations. Designing games and animations require a blend of creativity and technology. It all begins with an idea. Designers then develop and refine their ideas before they actually start the work. This is made possible by artists who create visual elements, and programmers who do the coding. You can create your own animations and games using ‘Scratch’ (Figure 4.2). Just as we use different languages to communicate, programmers use programming languages to communicate with devices like smartphones, computers, tablets, smartwatches, satellite and driverless cars.

At the end of the project, you will be able to: 1. Create a simple Scratch project with block programming; and 2. Design games and animations using Scratch. What will I need? Scratch is easy to use. It is called a ‘visual programming language’ since you can move around ‘blocks’ instead of writing complicated programmes in languages that take time to learn. These blocks allow you ‘write’ programmes to create animated figures, design games, and create your own wallpaper (Figure 4.3). Coding allows us to communicate with computers and smartphones. When you click on a button and the computer or smartphone responds, your click is translated into instructions in a language the machine understands. A series of instructions to computers or smartphones are called a programme. There are many languages with which you can communicate with computers, like Javascript, Python and C++. Among these languages, there are visual programming languages in which a series of programming instructions are clubbed into ‘blocks’. It allows us to combine different blocks and create sets of instructions. To carry out this project, you will need: • Computer or laptop with Internet connection. • ‘Scratch’ downloaded in the computer or laptop • Notebook • Pen or pencil • Loose papers • Markers • Cardboards Reprint 2025-26"}

Discuss the safety precautions, which should be taken while accessing the Internet with the teacher and your peers. Make a list of ‘to do’ and ‘not to do’.

As anything done in excess is not good, excess screen time is not good for your mental and physical health. Playing outside and including physical sports are good for your body and mind, so make sure you get enough of that in addition to the fun you have with smartphones and computers. So, limit your screen time as advised by your teacher and/or family members. What do I need to know before I start?

Among these sources are artefacts, objects made by humans that are old, unique and beautiful and related to our traditions and culture. These artefacts can be ancient or a part of our lives and societies in the present. A museum is a place in which artefacts are kept. Museums help us understand our history and culture (Figure 5.1). They show us what ancient people wore, what kind of work they did, what kind of artwork they created (e.g., paintings and sculptures), and what they wrote (manuscripts). Museums help us build the past in our minds, and see things, which we may never be able to otherwise. Museums also help us to learn about the present culture and work of different groups of people in the country and the world. They display artefacts related to art, traditions (Figure 5.2), architecture, and science. For example, the National Science Centres/Museums spread across India help us to learn about things that no longer exist, such as dinosaurs, and also about things that we can expect in the future. There are even some curious objects that defy what we think or we know, like a 1200 kg granite ball that spins on water at the National Science Centre in Delhi.

Cooking involves many methods like boiling, baking, steaming, grilling and frying. Raw food is heated to a high temperature, which changes the food, kills germs, improves texture and flavour, and makes it tastier and easier to eat. We often use a gas or other type of stove for cooking — the heat cooks the food. We also use different utensils, depending on what we are preparing. But did you know that we can cook without fire as well? Additionally, we also eat some foods without heating. Besides raw fruits, we eat certain raw vegetables. Only those vegetables that do not need cooking to be edible, can be eaten raw. For instance, can you eat raw potatoes? Raw vegetables maintain their maximum nutritional value since they are not exposed to heat, which can break down nutrients. Preparing food items and dishes without the use of fire or heat opens up a world of creativity and nutrition. The use of fresh, uncooked ingredients to create healthy meals involves techniques, for making salads and refreshing smoothies to inventive dips and desserts, and the possibilities are endless. This approach not only preserves the nutritional value of the ingredients but also encourages a closer connection to the food we consume, promoting mindful eating and a healthy lifestyle. Cooking also gives pleasure and develops a sense of pride. It also helps us to understand the importance of teamwork and cooperation as people who work in kitchen, like chef, cook, specialist cook, dish washer, kitchen porter and others have to work together. Do you help out when someone is cooking at home? Nutritional Value of Food You must have learnt about different components of food, nutritional value, balanced diet and related concepts in Science.

Using Artificial Intelligence to read information on food packets. Have you seen the thick and thin black lines on back of any package? This is called a ‘Bar Code’. This code contains information that can be read by machines. You can use mobile apps like Google Lens to read this Bar Code to get information related to ingredients, nutritional information, expiry dates and so on. Try reading the Bar Code of any food packet. Activity 3: Measure your food ingredients You might have discussed standard and non-standard units of measurement in your Science classes. When cooking, both standard and non-standard units are commonly used for measuring ingredients. Understanding these measurements will help you to ensure accuracy and consistency in your preparation. For example, one pinch of sugar (non-standard measurement) and 10 grams of flour (standard measurement). In case a kitchen weighing scale or measuring cups are not available, you can use common kitchen items, like cups, teaspoons and tablespoons to estimate quantities kitchen of ingredients. Some examples of measuring quantities of liquids are given below: • A teaspoon can contain about 5 ml of liquid. • A tablespoon can contain about 15 ml of liquid. • One cup can contain about 250 ml of liquid. • One litre of any liquid can be estimated with a capacity of 1 litre drinking water bottle. Therefore, it is good to have a rough idea of how many grams or litres of an ingredient can fit into a cup or tablespoon. Reprint 2025-26"}

For instance, sharp knives should be handled with care. Use a chopping board while cutting and always cut the food item away from the body and keep fingers clear of the blade. Measuring cups and spoons should be used accurately to ensure recipe success. Appliances like blenders and mixers should be operated according to manufacturer instructions to prevent accidents.
