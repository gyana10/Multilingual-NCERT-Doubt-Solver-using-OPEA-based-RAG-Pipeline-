The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured the students’ inherent abilities touching upon all the five planes of human existence, the pañchakośhas, in the Foundational and the Preparatory Stages have paved the way for the progression of their learning further at the Middle Stage. Thus, the Middle Stage acts as a bridge between the Preparatory and the Secondary Stages, spanning three years from Grade 6 to Grade 8. The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive and narrative capabilities and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages—including at least two languages native to India—to Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy—a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Reprint 2025-26"}

Poorvi, the English language textbook for Grade 6 is one of these. Its content comprises stories, poems and narratives that ensure a reflection of their social, cultural and geographical landscapes wherein they are sure to find traces of their lived experiences. Poorvi also weaves into its contents snippets from the vast treasure trove of Indian Knowledge Systems, India’s artistic and cultural heritage, and embeds values alongside ecological sensitivity, gender equality, digital skills, etc. For all practical purposes, it has, to my mind, succeeded in its curricular goals: first, to foster natural curiosity among students through a proper selection of content, and second, develop among them the core competencies in listening, speaking, reading and writing by intelligently designing various activities around them, thereby seamlessly integrating vocabulary and grammar within meaningful contexts. However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook, and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years.

Language education is essential for effective communication, aesthetic expression and appreciation. Reasoning and critical thinking are very closely linked with language use, and these are valuable capacities to be developed. Language development plays an important role in the development of perceptual and practical concepts, and also enables us to check our experiences with others to ensure that we have a shared meaning emerging from these experiences. The textual material developed for the Middle Stage will take children well beyond the Preparatory Stage. Curricular Goals, competencies, and learning outcomes have been the guiding principles while developing the textbook. The Curricular Goals (CG) cover a range of competencies. CG-1: Student develops independent reading comprehension and summarising skills of a variety of texts (stories, poems, extracts of plays, essays, articles and news reports). CG-2: Attains the ability to write about thoughts, feelings and experiences of social events. CG-3: Develops the capacity for effective communication using language skills for questioning, describing, analysing and responding. CG-4: Explores different literary devices and forms of literature. CG-5: Develops the ability to recognise basic linguistic aspects (word and sentence structure) and use them in oral and written expression. CG-6: Develops appreciation the distinctive features of the language, including its alphabet and script, sounds, rhymes, puns, and other wordplays and games unique to the language. C-6.1: Understands the phonetics and script of the language, the number of vowels and consonants, and how they interact and are used. C-6.2: Engages in the use of puns, rhymes, alliteration, and other wordplays in the language to make speech and writing more interesting and enjoyable. Reprint 2025-26"}

The end-of-the-text questions given in ‘Let us think and reflect’ are designed to encourage critical thinking, reasoning, responding, analysing, etc. Unit 1 ‘Fables and Folk Tales’ offers timeless wisdom through engaging narratives that resonate with young minds. It includes a classic fable as well as a folk tale from Tamil Nadu. The story, ‘A Bottle of Dew’ shows that true success comes from hard work and diligence.

Each rāga in Indian music carries its own emotional significance and is symbolically connected to certain seasons, times of day, and moods. Rāgas are believed to evoke specific emotions in listeners. Poorvi is an ancient and traditional Hindustani classical rāga that originated in eastern India. It is typically performed during the fourth prahar of the day, between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. It evokes a sense of calmness and contemplation in the journey of learners, symbolising a harmonious blend of traditional and modern learning.

To his surprise the sage answered, “Yes, in my travels in the Himalayas, I heard how you could make such a potion. But it is difficult.” “Tell me!” requested Rama Natha, not believing his luck. “You have to plant a banana plant and water it regularly with your hands. In winter, the morning dew is on the leaves.

Let me share some of the benefits of the spices that most of us have in our kitchen. Let me start with haldi, which is called turmeric in English. It helps in improving our energy level and digestion. It helps in reducing body pain too. Next, let us take methi, which is called fenugreek in English. You will be surprised to know that it helps me in keeping my sugar level and my body weight in control. I need to soak the methi seeds overnight and drink the water in the morning. • Jeera (cumin) seeds soaked in water overnight can also improve digestion and help cure sleeplessness. • You know, when you were babies and had gas in your tummy, I used to put heeng (asafoetida) water on your tummy to give you some relief. Heeng can also help in controlling cough and cold. • Dalchini (cinnamon) and laung (clove) give relief when we have toothache till we can consult a dentist. • Adrak (ginger) is another herb that can help us when we have cough and cold. It also gives relief from pain. Do you know, ginger has been used in cooking for more than 4000 years? Even today, it is extensively used in cooking Indian food. • Kali mirch (black pepper) is also helpful in digestion and can give us relief from body pain. • You may have seen that at the end of a meal, saunf (fennel seeds) and ajwain (carom seeds) are served. It is because they help in the digestion of food. • Elaichi (cardamom) also helps us with digestion and respiratory troubles in addition to curing bad breath.

When you enter a tiny room in Moti Vavdi village, Bhavnagar, Gujarat, you will see lots of bright colours. There are many lovely things like cushions, bedcovers, pillows, and more, with beautiful designs. Ila Sachani, a wonderful lady with a big smile, makes all these using a shiny needle to create these designs. She is very good at Kathiawar embroidery—a style that needs a lot of skill. 2. Ila Sachani’s journey began in the quiet settings of Amreli, Gujarat, where she was born into a farmer’s family. From the beginning, life presented its challenges, as Ila was born with her hands hanging loose by her sides. Unlike other children, she could not use her hands in the usual way. While other small hands drew figures in the sand or plucked wild flowers, she wondered why she could not join them. She too wanted to hold a chalk in her hands and draw figures on a slate. 3. Ila’s mother and grandmother encouraged the little girl and were single-minded to help her overcome her challenge.

The festival gives everyone a chance to look at kites of different shapes, sizes and colours. Gujarat is the main centre of celebrations but Uttarayan is also celebrated in Rajasthan and Telangana. In Karnataka, the Tourism Department has also been organising the Kite Festival once each year. Punjab also celebrates this festival of kites during Baisakhi and Basant Panchami.

I’m here today to share some simple information about Kathiawar embroidery. This is a very old form of embroidery. It uses many bright colours and also uses many types of stitches, like the chain stitch. The embroidery is commonly seen on clothes and home decoration items. On clothes, it is seen on children’s caps, ghagra skirts and men’s traditional shirts. In this embroidery, a lot of mirror work is done by fitting small mirrors along with the stitches. Most commonly, the designs used are geometric shapes like squares and triangles. The design of flowers is also used. There is much more to share but I’ll do that some other time. Thank you!
