The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF- SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured the students’ inherent abilities and touching upon all the five planes of human existence, the pañchakośhas, in the Foundational and the Preparatory Stages have paved the way for the progression of their learning further at the Middle Stage. Thus, the Middle Stage acts as a bridge between the Preparatory and the Secondary Stages, spanning three years from Grade 6 to Grade 8. The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages—including at least two languages native to India—to Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy—a role that will strike a Foreword"}

Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establishing conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject experts, pedagogues, and practicing teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. Adhering to the recommendations of the National Curriculum Framework for School Education, a new subject area called ‘Physical Education and Well-being’ has been introduced at the Middle Stage. This subject aims to promote love for physical activity and sports; develop capacities for skillful engagement in sports; and develop resilience, empathy, and cooperation. India has a wonderful tradition of Yoga which is a wholesome experience for maintaining mind and body wellbeing. The subject of Physical Education and Well-being includes various aspects of Yoga starting from Yama, Niyama, Āsana, Prānāyāma and Dhyāna in a progressive way from Class 3 till the Secondary Stage. This lays the foundation for holistic health and well-being. The book for Physical Education and Well-being, titled Khel Yatra for Grade 6, is meticulously designed to develop motor skills and engage children in the team sports of Kho-kho and Hand ball. Age-specific aspects of Yoga are designed to lay the foundation for healthy living. The textbook aligns with the competencies included in the NCF-SE 2023 for this stage. Khel Yatra emphasises the importance of physical activity and the values and dispositions essential for life. It incorporates cross-cutting themes, such as inclusion, gender equality, and cultural rootedness."}

However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years.

Considering the focus on holistic well-being, NCF-SE has mandated Physical Education and Well-being as a core curricular area for all stages of school education. To help the teachers and students achieve curricular goals of Physical Education and Well-being, for the first time a textbook has been designed for Grade 6. This book enables students to experience the joy of playing, explore diverse physical activities, practice fitness skills, learn basic sports skills, and immerse in the world of yoga. Sports and physical activities teach important motor skills, socio-emotional awareness and regulation, associated cognitive abilities, as well as the values of self-discipline, hard work, teamwork, and a gracious acceptance of one’s strengths and vulnerabilities. To achieve the goals of fitness, sports and holistic well-being, the Grade 6 textbook is designed to have five units. 1. Understanding the importance of Physical education 2. Motor fitness 3. Introduction to Kho-Kho 4. Introduction to Handball 5. Yoga In Unit 1, students explore the connection between physical education (PE) and well-being, emphasizing its impact on personal and social behaviour.

Students will also learn about the safety measures to minimize the risk of injuries and create a healthy environment for the players. In Unit 2, students learn different fitness components like endurance, strength, flexibility, and balance. The main aim is to understand how each of these components contributes to overall health. In the Units 3 and 4 focus is on learning new games. Kho Kho is introduced in Unit 3 and Handball in Unit 4. Through interactive sessions and group exercises, students will discover the excitement of sport and health advantages of physical activity. The emphasis will be on inclusivity, team cohesion, and enjoyment of movement. In the last unit, students immerse in the holistic nature of yoga. They learn about Yama (social discipline) and Niyama (Personal discipline) to inculcate healthy habits for positive behavior. Systematic practice of various yogasanas starting with Sūkshma Vyāyāma (loosening exercises), preparatory breathing practices and step-by-step performance of each asana helps our body to be flexible, strong, balanced and disease free. Various techniques of Prānāyāma strengthen the lungs, improves functioning of major systems of our body, calm down the mind, improve concentration and help in achieving overall harmony and well-being. To explore the world within us and experience deep sense of peace, tranquility and bliss, students learn different techniques of Dhārana (single pointed concentration) and Dhyāna (meditation). Learning various yogic practices lays foundation for long and healthy life. In this book, apart from learning the games and physical activities, students will learn to follow rules, understand the importance of safe practices and fair play, work harmoniously in groups, treat each other with courtesy and respect, as well as, help each other, and experience the joy of playing together.

NCF-SE recommends allocating block period (2 periods together) for physical education and well- being. If it is not possible to allocate two block periods and one single period every week, it is necessary to design single periods with different focus to ensure sufficient time for activities, game and circle time. Suggestions are given below for two different scenarios of timetable. • Scenario 1 – Five single periods per week. • Scenario 2 – Two block periods for Units 1 to 4 and single period for yoga. Scenario 1: Three different types of sessions have been visualised to effectively use the limited time in each period and achieve the learning outcomes. • Type 1: Maximizes game practice. • Type 2: Maximizes circle time after play to provide sufficient time for discussing cognitive and socio-emotional aspects. • Type 3: Maximizes gamified drills to focus on one specific skill.

These sutras describe a step-by-step path to achieve the highest state of bliss (Samādhi) through systematic practices defined as the eight limbs or aspects, called Ashtāṅga Yoga. We will learn more about Ashtāṅga Yoga later in this chapter. Yoga continued to evolve with new practices and ideas. Hatha Yoga, which deals with the practical aspects of Yoga, was developed around 1,500 years ago. In the 19th and 20th centuries, Yoga masters like Swami Vivekananda, Paramahamsa Yogananda, Sage Aurobindo and B.K.S. Iyengar brought Yoga to the rest of the world. Today, Yoga is practised globally; the International Day of Yoga is celebrated on 21st June in more than 190 countries. What is Yoga? Ancient Indians had discovered that practising Yoga, can lead one to good health and well-being. Yoga can be defined as the science of healthy and happy living. It helps us to be peaceful and efficient in our work, study and other activities and move towards the full realisation of our potential. The term Yoga is derived from the Sanskrit word “yuj” which means “to unite or integrate”. It signifies the union of the body, mind and inner self. Yoga is about bringing different parts of yourself to create balance, harmony and a sense of oneness – both within and with the world around you. It also helps make the mind still, quiet and free from all distractions. Yoga involves systematic efforts, not haphazard actions. Efforts become fruitful only through disciplined actions."}

Malli Mastan Babu’s Determination Malli Mastan Babu was born in a small village in Andhra Pradesh and his father was a farmer. A bright student and eager to learn about new things, Babu studied very hard and went to some of the best schools in India. He got degrees in engineering and management. During the course of his studies, Babu developed a keen interest in mountaineering. Inspired by the challenge and beauty of the mountains, he decided to pursue this passion alongside his professional career. He trained hard, learning everything about climbing. He practiced yoga to build physical strength, flexibility and stay mentally focused, all of which helped in his challenging climbs.

His approach to mountaineering was driven by an unwavering passion and dedication. He believed in pushing his limits and embraced the challenges that came with high-altitude climbing. Through his climbs, he aimed to inspire others to follow their dreams and overcome obstacles, no matter how difficult they might seem. Babu, whenever on expedition, would plan every last detail. He would start early in the day, carry his own load and walk at a steady clip throughout the day. During his expedition he used to pitch his own tent, cook his own food and fine-tune the next day’s plan with his guide. Babu’s record-breaking achievement was that he completed climbing seven highest peaks in seven continents in 172 days. With this, Babu set a new benchmark of physical and mental endurance and excellence. He became the first Indian and South Asian to achieve this record, earning him international recognition and admiration.

Reflection: At the end of the week, discuss what you have learned about self-discipline and how it felt to work towards achieving the goal. Pratyāhāra Pratyāhāra, the fifth aspect of Ashtāṅga Yoga, is all about learning to control your senses and focus your mind. Imagine you are in a noisy room, but you need to concentrate on your homework. Pratyāhāra means to restrain or to withdraw, not to get disturbed by things that one sees, hears, smells, tastes or feels. Pratyāhāra helps you ignore the noise and focus on what you're doing by tuning out distractions. By practising this you learn to turn your attention inward, away from the things around you and become more aware of your thoughts and feelings. We sense the world around us through five senses; to focus on the desired activity and avoid distractions, we need to master these senses by practices. Let’s look at some activities which will help us in turning senses inwards. 1. Quiet time: Find a comfortable place to sit quietly without any distractions (no TV, mobile phone, or loud noises). Close your eyes and focus on your breathing."}

Breathing Practices Before learning Prānāyāma, it is necessary to improve the function of the lungs. For healthy lungs, it is necessary to practice proper breathing. Let us learn about Rabbit and Dog breathing. Rabbit breathing focuses on deep, rhythmic breaths that mimic the breathing pattern of a rabbit. Dog breathing involves mimicking the rapid, shallow breathing of a dog, which can help to release heat from the body and improve breath control.

The term “Sūkshma Vyāyāma” comes from Sanskrit, where “Sūkshma” means “subtle” or “micro” and “Vyāyāma” means “exercise” or “movement”. These exercises are gentle, easy to perform and can be practised by people of all ages and fitness levels. The exercises involve small, subtle movements that focus on different parts of the body. These movements help to increase circulation, improve joint mobility and release muscular tension. The subtle movements enhance blood flow to various parts of the body, promoting better circulation and oxygenation of tissues. Each movement is synchronised with the breath, enhancing the flow of Prānā (vital energy) throughout the body. The simplicity of Sūkshma Vyāyāma makes it accessible to everyone, including the elderly, those with limited mobility or beginners new to Yoga. These exercises can be performed while sitting or standing. Sūkshma Vyāyāma includes neck exercises, shoulder rotations, finger and wrist movements knee movements, ankle and foot exercises, etc. Let’s practice Sūkshma Vyāyāma for the neck.

By practising Pratyāhāra one can avoid distraction caused by our senses. By doing this one can process the inward journey. In the previous chapters, we have learnt various ways of managing the senses through Pratyāhāra activities."}

Have you ever sat down calmly with your eyes closed? When our eyes are open, we see the world outside and when our eyes are closed, we can experience the world within us. Dhārana, Dhyāna and Samādhi are three limbs of Ashtāṅga Yoga, which deal with focusing and calming the mind to experience peace and joy. The first step towards experiencing the peace within is to focus our wandering mind on some object, it can be observing the breath or flame of the candle or the tip of the thumb from the stretched hand. This single-point concentration is called Dhārana. Dhārana involves keeping the mind steady and maintaining concentration. Let us learn the art of focusing by practising Jatru Trataka using the shoulders and the thumbs. Jatru Trataka Jatru Trataka is a Yogic gazing that helps to bring one pointed concentration or focus. It is a practice where the gaze is fixed on an object or the target. Dhārana, Dhyāna, and Samādhi Chapter 5"}

{"class": "class 6", "subject": "phe", "page_no": 191, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "169 Yoga Dhyāna Dhyāna means meditation, contemplation or reflection of the higher self or God. When concentration becomes uninterrupted and flows continuously like a stream, it transforms into Dhyāna. In Dhyāna, there is a continuous flow of attention towards the chosen focus without distraction. Unlike Dhārana where effort is required to maintain concentration, Dhyāna is characterised by a state of effortless presence and immersion in the object of meditation. Practising Dhyāna leads to a profound sense of inner stillness and tranquility. Regular practice of Dhyāna enhances mental clarity, sharpens focus, reduces anxiety and improves cognitive function. Dhyāna can be practiced in many ways. In this grade, we will learn about Nadānusandhāna (meditating on sound). Guidelines for the practice of Dhyāna 1. Find a calm and clean place. Sit in Padmāsana or Sukhāsana with the spine erect and the body relaxed. 2. Select the object of focus, such as a breath or a mantrā or some visual object and focus your attention on it. Keep your eyes closed during the practice. 3. Remain non-reactive to the thoughts or emotions that come up during the practice. 4. In the beginning it is generally difficult to observe the breath for a long time. If your mind wanders, slowly but firmly bring your attention back to your breath. 5. Consistency is important; practice dhyāna daily, starting with a few minutes and gradually increasing the duration."}

Therefore, Nādanusandhāna involves the exploration and deep meditation on sound vibrations. Different sounds like A, U, M and AUM are chanted slowly so that they generate a fine resonance all over the body. • Sit in Vajrāsana or Sukhāsana with the spine erect, face relaxed and eyes gently closed. • Adopt Cin Mudra in both hands and place it on the thighs. • Chant Akāra for three to five rounds and feel the resonance in the lower body (abdominal). • Chant Ukāra for three to five rounds and feel the resonance in the middle (chest region) part of the body. • Chant Mkāra for three to five rounds and feel the resonance in the upper (head region) part of the body. • Chant Omkāra for three to five rounds and feel the resonance in the body. • Repeat the Nādanusandhāna several times a day. It helps in the expansion of awareness. Samādhi Samādhi is the highest state of consciousness. This is possible to achieve during meditation. In Samādhi, the mind is focused perfectly on the higher self or God for a long time."}
