{"class": "class 6", "subject": "sst", "page_no": 3, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "iii Foreword Foreword The National Education Policy 2020 envisages a system of education in the country that is rooted in Indian ethos and its civilisational accomplishments in all domains of human endeavour and knowledge while at the same time preparing the students to constructively engage with the prospects and challenges of the twenty-first century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured the students’ inherent abilities touching upon all the five planes of human existence, the pañchakośhas, in the Foundational and the Preparatory Stages has paved the way for the progression of their learning further at the Middle Stage. Thus, the Middle Stage acts as a bridge between the Preparatory and the Secondary Stages, spanning three years from Grade 6 to Grade 8. This framework, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages — including at least two languages native to India — to Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-Being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy — a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality Reprint 2025-26"}

Various Curricular Area Groups, which were constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. This textbook of Social Science closely follows the vision of the NCF-SE 2023. It innovates in minimizing the text by focusing on core concepts and major developments. These are also conveyed through abundant pictures, drawings, maps and other graphics, which are brought to life by a pleasant and attractive overall design. The textbook seeks to keep students engaged through a variety of exercises, occasions for reflection, activities and projects, all of which invite them to explore and discover by themselves. The selection of five themes takes care of the important requirement of maintaining a multidisciplinary perspective. Cultural rootedness, another requirement, is thus not limited to the theme ‘Our Cultural Heritage and Knowledge Traditions’, but pervades the other themes as well. It is hoped that students and teachers alike will find using this textbook an enjoyable and enriching experience. However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years.

One of them is Social Science. You had a brush with it earlier, but from this Grade 6 onward you will discover more of this world of ours, beginning with our country, India. We have done our best to make this textbook stimulating:  Whenever possible, we have used your immediate environment — the world as you know it — as a starting point.  We have tried to keep the text to a minimum by focusing on the ‘big ideas’ — ideas you will encounter in your life for sure. Ideas that will help you understand India and the world.  We have encouraged you to reflect on these ideas or important facts — to explore, discover, think, create, ask questions and propose answers. Rote learning is not the goal of good education; understanding and reflection are.  We have included more illustrations than ever before, as they often convey a message better than long explanations. They also make the textbook more lively and pleasant to browse through.  We have selected five main themes — you will see them in the Table of Contents. This has enabled us to combine in a single theme inputs from several disciplines — whether history, geography, political science or economics. This brings us closer to real life.  Finally, we have given some emphasis to understanding India’s foundations. India is a young nation but an old civilisation. The former would not exist without the latter. Preparing this textbook has been a labour of love. If you have felt attracted to a few pages here and there, to some picture Reprint 2025-26"}

We wish you an enjoyable journey through Social Science and its rich insights into human life and society.    A note on the pronunciation of Sanskrit words Since this textbook is in English, we use the Roman alphabet. But we will also encounter some words in Sanskrit and a few other Indian languages. The Roman alphabet cannot make their pronunciation clear without some additional marks or signs, such as dashes, dots or accents, called ‘diacritical signs’ or ‘diacritics’. You can ignore all these signs if you wish, and you don’t need to remember them. However, as we are using only a few simple signs, you will find it easy to get used to them. You will also find that they help you pronounce Sanskrit words fairly correctly. Here is how they work:  A short dash (called ‘macron’) over a vowel makes it long. For instance, dāna is pronounced ‘daana’; līlā is pronounced ‘leelaa’; sūtra is sootra.  śh and ṣh are pronounced similar to ‘sh’ in ‘shall’ (there is a slight difference, since they correspond to श and ष in the Devanagari script; see next point). So śhāstra is pronounced ‘shaastra’; kṣhīra is ‘ksheera’.  Consonants with a dot below them (ḍ ṭ ṣh and ṇ mainly) are pronounced by hitting the tongue on the roof of the mouth; without a dot, they are pronounced with the tongue on the teeth. Examples of consonants pronounced with the tongue hitting the roof of the mouth: Āryabhaṭa, gaṇa, paṭhana (studying), pīṭha, goṣhṭhī (association, assembly), dhanāḍhya (rich), aṇu (atom).  Finally, ṛ is the Devanagari letter ऋ. We choose to write it as ṛi, although in some parts of India it is also pronounced as ṛu. So we write ‘Ṛig Veda’, for instance. Reprint 2025-26"}

On the other hand, the world is witnessing multiple wars, armed conflicts and rising social tensions, and our planet’s natural environment is under great stress. We live in an age of great possibilities but also great challenges. The world over, more and more people wonder, “How do we solve the problems facing humanity? How can our societies learn to live in peace and harmony? How can we protect this beautiful Earth which we all share — and protect it not only for ourselves but also for all the species that live on it?” These fundamental questions are simple, but the answers are not. They cannot be simple, because human societies are very diverse and complex. If we wish to find answers to such questions and help build a better future, we first need to understand our world, and human societies in particular. That is what Social Science is all about.

Social Science has many subdisciplines: geography, history, political science, economics, sociology, anthropology, archaeology, psychology and a few more. You need not feel intimidated by all these terms! While you will study some of these subdisciplines in the Secondary Stage, in the Middle Stage we have avoided this classification. Instead, we have opted for five broad themes. Let us briefly look at them. Theme A – India and the World: Land and the People This first theme includes the basics of the geographical world around us — some of the main features of our planet and the way to represent them on a map. Why is this theme important, when today we can get excellent maps on a mobile phone? Because it deals with much more than maps. It also asks how geographical features — oceans, mountains, rivers, etc. — have shaped entire civilisations throughout their histories. It is also, in India’s case, about how its natural setting has contributed to giving this ancient civilisation a unique identity. Theme B – Tapestry of the Past A tapestry is a large piece of canvas-like cloth usually kept as a wall hanging, with pictures and designs on it — sometimes a historical narrative. Our tapestry is where we will be painting scenes from the past, beginning with India’s past. But why should we be at all concerned with the past? Because it is the key to understanding the present, and the chapters in this theme will often make this connection clear. The past is a major source for our identities — it helps us understand who we are and where we come from. Reprint 2025-26"}

And since history is unfortunately not all about happy developments, it is useful to understand where people, governments or rulers went wrong, and why. Only then can we hope to avoid repeating those errors. Theme C – Our Cultural Heritage and Knowledge Traditions It has often been said that India has a rich and ancient culture. True, but what are its main characteristics? Its guiding principles? How has it manifested itself in India’s history? And how can it help us to deal with issues of our times? These are some of the questions that this theme is exploring, with the objective that every student should understand some of the cultural foundations of our civilisation and learn to appreciate their value. Theme D – Governance and Democracy Citizens of any country should know how their political system functions. India, as the world’s largest democracy, has an elaborate system working at different levels. What are its chief characteristics and components? How do the citizens participate in the overall governance? What are their rights and also their duties or dharma? Are there different systems in other countries, and, if so, of what type? How are different countries supposed to interact? By studying this theme, we can become more responsible citizens, understand how the organs of the government function, and learn to have a say in the policies that affect us all, whether locally or nationally.

This is as it should be — Social Science is also about the art of asking the right questions. Only then can we start looking for the right answers. This also explains the presence of ‘Big Questions’ at the start of each chapter in this book. You may also be intrigued to find a game of chess and some ancient Tamil poetry in chapters that apparently deal with geography; a discussion on the uses of the sari in a chapter on cultural heritage; the concept of sevā and the mention of festivals in chapters focusing on economics. This is deliberate. We believe in bringing elements from diverse fields together (you will learn later that this is called ‘multidisciplinarity’). This enriches our perspective. Indeed, life constantly mixes numerous elements together, so why should we not? By now, it should be clear that although Social Science makes constant use of the past, it seeks to make sense of the present so as to help us prepare a better future. It is an exploration and an adventure. Reprint 2025-26"}

A Map and Its Components From this simple example, we understand that a map is a representation, or a drawing, of some area — it may be a small area (a village, a town, etc.), a bigger area (say, your district or state), or a very large area like India or even the whole world. In a map, you look at the surface as if you are viewing it from the top. An atlas is a book or collection of maps. As you will discover, there are several kinds of maps —  physical maps, which mainly show some natural features such as mountains, oceans and rivers (see an example in Fig. 5.2 in this textbook)  political maps, which show details of countries or states, boundaries, cities, etc. (for instance, a map of India with all its States, Union Territories and their capitals)  thematic maps, with a specific kind of information (examples include Fig. 6.3 and Fig. 8.1 in this textbook).

Let us now define them more precisely. Have you ever wondered how a huge place can fit on a small piece of paper? It is all thanks to the map’s scale. Let us go back to our map of a small city (Fig. 1.1). Each centimetre on the map, as printed here, represents a certain distance on the ground — let us suppose it is 500 metres; we say that the scale is 1 cm = 500 m. Now, turn to the map of India in Fig. 5.2 in Chapter 5 of this textbook. The scale is repre- sented in the bottom left corner by a ruler with ‘500’ written above its length and ‘km’ on the side. It simply means that this ruler, which measures 2.5 cm in the printed map, corresponds to 500 kilometres on the ground. So, the actual distance between two points represented on the map depends on the scale that the map is using. LET’S EXPLORE Æ Draw a simple map of a school’s playground. Let us assume it is a rectangle, 40 m in length and 30 m in width. Draw it precisely with your ruler on a scale of 1 cm = 10 m. Æ Now measure the diagonal of the rectangle. How many centimetres do you get? Using the scale, calculate the real length of the playground’s diagonal, in metres. Let us return to the four arrows at the top right of the small city’s map. They point to four directions, which are north, at the top, and, moving clockwise, east, south and west. These are called the cardinal directions, also cardinal points. Other than these, intermediate directions are also used — northeast (NE), southeast (SE), southwest (SW) and northwest (NW). Most maps simply have an arrow marked with the letter ‘N’, which points to the north direction. North South East West Northwest Southwest Northeast Southeast Reprint 2025-26"}

Æ Taking your school as the starting point, do you know approximately in which cardinal direction your home is located? Discuss with your teacher and your parents. Symbols are another important component of maps. Our map has small drawings of actual buildings and a few other elements, but there would not be enough space on the map of a large city or a country to draw them all. Instead, a symbol is used to represent these features — symbols for different kinds of buildings (for instance a railway station, a school, a post office), for roads and railway lines, and for natural elements such as a river, a pond or a forest. In that way, numerous details can be shown in the limited space available on a map. To make maps more easily understood by a variety of users, map makers use specific symbols. Different countries use different sets of symbols. The Survey of India, a government body, has fixed a set of symbols for maps of India (or parts of India).

Representing a sphere accurately on a flat sheet of paper is not possible. To understand why, peel an orange in such a way that you have just three or four large pieces of the skin; then try and flatten them on a table — you will see that you cannot do it without tearing them at the edges.

Let us now explore some of its features. a) Understanding coordinates Imagine a big market in a city or town, with neat rows of shops, all the same size. You want to meet a friend at a stationery shop inside the market. But your friend does not know where the shop is. So you would give directions like, “Meet me at 6 pm at the 7th shop in the 5th row from the entrance.” This will allow your friend to precisely determine your location. Now, consider a chessboard. To record moves by advanced players, letters are placed alongside the main pieces (from ‘a’ to ‘h’, see the image) and numbers (from 1 to 8) in between the two sides. This simple system allows players to mark each square and record every move. Here, the white side has just opened the game by moving the queen’s pawn two squares forward (a very common opening). So, the pawn is said to have moved from d2 to d4. LET’S EXPLORE Using the same terms, write down your move if you play black and respond with the same move. Reprint 2025-26"}

Thanks to their two coordinates, the stationery shop as well as the chess square on the chessboard can be precisely determined. A similar system of coordinates is used in the world of maps to determine the location of any place on a map. Let us see how this system works. b) Latitudes Let us return to the globe. It is easy to identify the North Pole and the South Pole on it. Rotate the globe; while it rotates, the fixed points at the top and bottom are the two poles. Halfway between them is the Equator; note the circle marking it (see Fig. 1.3). Imagine that you stand on the Equator and travel towards one of the poles; your distance from the Equator increases. Latitude measures this distance from the Equator. At any point of this travel, you can draw an imaginary line that runs east and west, parallel to the Equator. Such a line is called a parallel of latitude and it draws a circle around the Earth. Again, it is easy to note on the globe that the largest circle is the Equator, while the circles marked by the parallels of latitude grow smaller as we move northward or southward (Fig. 1.3). Latitudes are expressed in degrees; by convention, the Equator is latitude 0° (zero degree), while the latitudes of the two poles are 90° North and 90° South respectively; this is noted 90°N and 90°S. There is a connection between latitude and climate. Around the Equator, the climate is generally hot (it is also called ‘torrid’). As you travel away from the Equator towards one of the two poles (in other words, as your latitude increases), the climate becomes more moderate (or ‘temperate’). And closer to the North or South Pole, the climate grows colder (or ‘frigid’). You will learn in Science why this is so, and Reprint 2025-26"}

Slowly rotating the globe eastward, we can note that for some places on the Earth it is morning, while for others it is mid-day, evening or night — when it’s breakfast time in one country, it’s lunchtime in another and in a third country people are fast asleep! That is why by measuring the longitude of a place, we will also be measuring the time at that place. Let us see how. To measure longitudes, we need to define a reference point called the Prime Meridian (Fig. 1.3 on page 15). It is also called Greenwich Meridian because, in the year 1884, some nations decided that the meridian passing through Greenwich, an area of London in England, would become the international standard for the Prime Meridian. It is marked as 0° longitude. Just as latitude is a measure of the distance from the Equator if you travel towards one of the poles, longitude is a measure of the distance from the Prime Meridian if you travel along the Equator. Longitude, too, is measured in degrees. Westward or eastward, it increases in value from 0° to 180°, with the letter ‘W’ or ‘E’ added. For instance, using round figures, New York’s longitude is 74°W, while Delhi’s is 77°E and Tokyo’s is 140°E. DON’T MISS OUT As you can see on the globe of meridians of longitudes, 180°W and 180°E are the same longitude; so this longitude is noted 180°, omitting the letter W or E. Latitude and longitude together are the two coordinates of a place. With them, you are now able to locate any place on Earth! You can now understand a statement such as “Delhi lies at 29°N latitude and 77°E longitude” (these values are rounded off, not exact).

The same method can be used to calculate the local time of any place on the Earth. But it would not be convenient for a country to use many local times!

We can see that the lines dividing the time zones are not fully straight. This is because they have to respect each country’s standard time and, therefore, tend to follow international borders.

Indeed, early astronauts lovingly called the Earth the ‘blue planet’. The largest water bodies we see on the globe are called ‘oceans’.

Oceans On the world map in Fig. 2.3 on page 32, we can observe five oceans — the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Arctic Ocean and the Southern (or Antarctic) Ocean. Although we have listed five oceans, it is clear from the map that they are not really separate. The lines that divide them on the map are no more than conventions — the natural world does not follow such boundaries. Seawater, for example, constantly flows across different oceans, sustaining a rich diversity of marine life. Many plant and animal species can be found across multiple oceans. The marine flora includes tiny plants called algae and all kinds of seaweeds; the marine fauna consists of thousands of species of colourful fish, dolphins, whales, and countless mysterious deep-sea creatures. Each part of the ocean, from the sun-lit surface to the dark depths, has its own diverse life forms. Marine: Related to or found in the oceans and seas.

Oceans and disasters Returning to the picture of the Earth at the start of this chapter, you may have noticed white shapes across the globe. Did you guess what they are? They are large masses of clouds. Such clouds bring rain to the continents; for instance, the monsoon rains we in India expect every summer originate in the ocean — without such rains, our agriculture and all life will suffer. But oceans often also give rise to storms — violent events with extreme rainfall or very strong winds, such as cyclones, which can cause widespread damage to coastal regions of the world. A tsunami is another natural disaster that originates in the ocean. It is a huge and powerful wave generally caused by a strong earthquake or a volcanic eruption at the bottom of the ocean.

From early times, people have used oceans and seas to migrate to other regions, to trade in all kinds of goods, to conduct military campaigns, and as a source of food through fishing.

Suppose that you are travelling by road from the region known as Chhota Nagpur in Jharkhand, reach Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh, and go on to Almora in Uttarakhand. On the way, you will see very different landscapes. In fact, you will encounter three major landforms, which we will now explore. LET’S EXPLORE Æ As a class activity, form groups of four or five students and observe the school’s surroundings. What kind of landscape do you see? Will the landscape change a few kilometres away? Or within some 50 kilometres? Compare with other groups. Æ In the same groups, discuss a journey that any of you has made through a region of India. List the different landscapes seen on the way. Compare with other groups. A landform is a physical feature on the surface of our planet Earth. Landforms take shape over millions of years and have a significant connection with the environment and life. They can broadly be divided into three categories — mountains, plateaus and plains (Fig. 3.1). These landforms have different climates and are home to a variety of flora and fauna. Humans have adapted to all landforms, but the number of people living on different kinds of landforms varies throughout the world. Mountains Mountains are landforms that are much higher than the surrounding landscape. They can be recognised by a broad base, steep slopes and a narrow summit. Depending on their height, some mountains are covered with snow. At lower altitudes, the snow melts every summer and turns Altitude: The height of an object above sea level.

Aspects of their life are visible in rock paintings found in hundreds of caves all over the world. Some of those paintings depict simple figures or a few symbols; others are more detailed and represent scenes with animals or humans. In time, these early humans learned to make simple ornaments such as stone or shell beads, pendants made of animal teeth, and sometimes exchanged them with other groups. The First Crops Over long ages, the Earth’s climate has gone through many changes. At certain times, it was very cold and much of the Earth was covered with ice — this is called an ‘Ice Age’, as you will learn in greater detail in Science. Later, when the climate warmed up, this ice partly melted, and the resulting waters swelled the existing rivers and eventually drained into the oceans. The last Ice Age lasted from over 100,000 (one lakh) years ago to around 12,000 years ago. Afterwards, living conditions improved for humans; in many parts of the world, they started settling down and cultivating cereals and grains. They also domesticated animals such as cattle, goats, etc. With more food available, these communities grew in size and number, and often settled down near rivers.

As time went by, hamlets grew into sizeable villages that exchanged goods — mostly food, clothing and tools. Slowly, networks of communication and exchange were established among those villages, and some of them grew into small towns. New technologies appeared — for example pottery, for making pots and other clay objects; and the use of metal (copper first, iron later), which helped make durable tools, objects of daily use and ornaments.

How Foreigners Named India The first foreigners to mention India were the Persians, the ancient inhabitants of Iran. In the 6th century BCE, a Persian emperor launched a military campaign and gained control of the region of the Indus River, which, as we saw, was earlier called ‘Sindhu’. So, it is no surprise that in their earliest records and stone inscriptions, the Persians referred to India as ‘Hind’, ‘Hidu’ or ‘Hindu’, which are adaptations in their language of ‘Sindhu’. (Note that in ancient Persian, ‘Hindu’ is a purely geographical term; it does not refer here to the Hindu religion.) Based on these Persian sources, the ancient Greeks named the region ‘Indoi’ or ‘Indike’. They dropped the initial letter ‘h’ of ‘Hindu’ because this letter did not exist in their Greek language. Sindhu Hindhu Indoi / Indike The ancient Chinese also interacted with India. In several texts, they refer to India as ‘Yintu’ or ‘Yindu’. This word also originally comes from ‘Sindhu’, in the following manner: Sindhu Hindhu Indu Yindu Reprint 2025-26"}

At the end of Chapter 4, we saw the first human groups settling down, practising agriculture, developing some technologies (such as construction, metallurgy, transport) and moving towards ‘civilisation’. What, then, is civilisation? In general, the term is used for an advanced stage of human societies. To be precise, we will consider here that a ‘civilisation’ should have at least the following characteristics:  some form of government and administration — to manage a more complex society and its many activities;  urbanism — town-planning, the growth of cities and their management, which generally includes water management and a drainage system;  a variety of crafts — including the management of raw materials (such as stone or metal) and the production of finished goods (such as ornaments and tools);  trade both internal (within a city or a region) and external (with distant regions or other parts of the world) — to exchange all sorts of goods;  some form of writing — needed to keep records and to communicate;  cultural ideas about life and the world, expressed through art, architecture, literature, oral traditions or social customs;  a productive agriculture — enough to feed not just the villages, but also the cities.

In the region known as Mesopotamia (modern Iraq and Syria), that happened about 6,000 years ago, and the civilisation in ancient Egypt followed a few centuries later. You will learn about these and a few more civilisations in a later grade.

This made those plains fertile and, therefore, favourable to agriculture. A little further east, a few millenniums ago, another river, the Sarasvatī, used to flow from the foothills of the Himalayas through Haryana, Punjab, parts of Rajasthan and Gujarat (see Fig. 6.3). In this whole region, from about 3500 BCE, villages grew into towns, and with increasing trade and other exchanges, those towns further grew into cities. This transition happened around 2600 BCE. Archaeologists gave this civilisation several names — ‘Indus’, ‘Harappan’, ‘Indus-Sarasvatī’ or ‘Sindhu-Sarasvatī’ civilisation. We will use all these terms. Its inhabitants are called ‘Harappans’. It is one of the oldest civilisations in the world. Tributary: A river that flows into a larger river (or lake). For instance, the Yamuna is a tributary of the Ganga.

But there are also many sites along the Sarasvatī River, which today goes by the name of ‘Ghaggar’ in India and ‘Hakra’ in Pakistan (hence the name ‘Ghaggar-Hakra River’). This river is now seasonal, because it flows only during the rainy season. The Sarasvatī River is first mentioned in the Ṛig Veda, an ancient collection of prayers which we will read about in Chapter 7. In this text, Sarasvatī is worshipped both as a goddess and as a river flowing ‘from the mountain to the sea’. Later texts describe the river as drying up and eventually disappearing. Town-Planning Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, now in Pakistan, were the first two cities of this civilisation to be discovered; their identification goes back to 1924, a century ago.

Such discoveries continue even today! It is interesting to note that the Sarasvatī basin includes not only two major cities — Rakhigarhi and Ganweriwala — but also several smaller ones (Farmana in Haryana, Kalibangan in Rajasthan) and a few towns (Bhirrana and Banawali, both in Haryana); indeed, the map (Fig. 6.3 on page 89) makes clear the high density of sites in that region. The larger Harappan cities were built according to precise plans. They had wide streets (Fig. 6.4 and 6.5 on page 92), which were often oriented to the cardinal directions. Most cities seem to have been surrounded by fortifications and had two distinct parts — the ‘upper town’, where the local elite probably lived, and the ‘lower town’, where common people lived. Some large buildings seem to have been used for collective purposes — for instance, warehouses where goods to be transported were stored. Individual houses of various sizes lined the streets and smaller lanes. Interestingly, the quality of construction was the same for small and big houses. All those buildings were generally made of bricks. The purpose of some of the structures remains a matter of debate. This is the case of the famous ‘Great Bath’ in Mohenjo-daro (Fig. 6.6 on page 93), a small but elaborate tank which measured about 12 × 7 metres and had waterproofing materials (such as natural bitumen, a form of tar) applied on top of carefully laid-out bricks.

They exported ornaments, timber, some objects of daily use (Fig. 6.11 on page 98), probably also gold and cotton, and possibly some food items. The most favoured ornaments were beads of carnelian (Fig. 6.10 on page 98), a reddish semiprecious stone found mostly in Gujarat. Harappan craftspeople developed special tech- niques to drill them, so a string could pass through them, and to decorate them in various ways. They also worked conch shells into beautiful shell bangles, which requires sophisticated techniques as shell is a hard material.

Two factors are currently agreed upon. First, a climatic change which affected much of the world from 2200 BCE onward, causing reduced rainfall and a drier phase. This would have made agriculture more difficult and could have reduced food supply to the cities. Second, the Sarasvatī River dried up in its central basin; suddenly, cities there, such as Kalibangan or Banawali were abandoned. There could have been other factors, but these two remind us of how much we depend on climate and the environment for our well-being.

Like any ancient tree, it has many roots and many branches. The roots nurture a common trunk. And from the trunk emerge many branches, which are different manifestations of Indian culture, yet united by a common trunk. Some of these branches are about art, literature, science, medicine, religion, the art of governance, martial arts, and so on. There are also ‘schools of thought’, by which we mean groups of thinkers or spiritual seekers who share similar ideas about human life, the world, etc. Many archaeologists and scholars have pointed out that some of India’s cultural roots go all the way to the Indus or Harappan or Sindhu-Sarasvatī civilisation (which we visit in Chapter 6). Later on, over time, hundreds of schools of thought emerged in India. We will see here a few early schools, which have shaped India into a country with a unique personality. By understanding them and their roots, we can understand ‘India, that is Bharat’ better. The Vedas and Vedic Culture a. What are the Vedas? The word “Veda” comes from the Sanskrit vid which means ‘knowledge’ (hence vidyā, for instance). We briefly mentioned the Ṛig Veda in earlier chapters. In fact, there are four Vedas — the Ṛig Veda, the Yajur Veda, the Sāma Veda and the Atharva Veda. They are the most ancient texts of India, and indeed among the most ancient in the world. The Vedas consist of thousands of hymns — prayers in the form of poems and songs — that were recited orally, not written. Those hymns were composed in the Sapta Sindhava region (which we visit in Chapter 5). It is difficult to say when exactly the Ṛig Veda, the most ancient of the four, was composed; experts have proposed dates ranging from Spiritual: Concerned with the spirit or soul (ātman in Sanskrit and many Indian languages). Spirituality is the search for a deeper or higher dimension beyond our current personality. Seeker: Someone who seeks the truths of this world.

Daily rituals were generally in the form of prayers and offerings to Agni, the deity associated with fire, but those rituals became more and more complex in the course of time. A group of texts known as ‘Upaniṣhads’ built upon Vedic concepts and introduced new ones, such as rebirth (taking birth again and again) and karma (our actions or their results). According to one school of thought, generally known as ‘Vedanta’, everything — human life, nature and the universe — is one divine essence called brahman (not to be confused with the god Brahmā) or sometimes just tat (‘that’).

In any case, it makes no difference to our story here. As the story goes, then, Siddhārtha Gautama grew up living a protected life in the palace. One day, at the age of 29, he asked to be driven through the city in a chariot, and for the first time in his life came across an old man, a sick man, and a dead body. He also saw an ascetic, who appeared to be happy and at peace. Following this experience, Siddhārtha decided to give up his palace life, leaving behind his wife and son. Travelling on foot as an ascetic, meeting other ascetics and scholars, he searched for the root cause of suffering in human life. After meditating for many days under a pipal tree at Bodh Gaya (today in Bihar), he attained enlightenment; he realised that avidyā (ignorance) and attachment are the source of human suffering and conceived a method to remove these two causes. Siddhārtha, then, became known as the ‘Buddha’, which means the ‘enlightened’ or ‘awakened’ one. The Buddha started teaching what he had realised, including the idea of ahimsa, which is generally translated as ‘non- violence’, but originally means ‘non-hurting’ or ‘non-injuring’.

The soldiers attacked the monkeys. The only way for the monkey-king to save his monkeys was to help them cross the stream, but they could not do so on their own. Being much larger than them, the monkey-king caught hold of a tree on the other bank and let them use his body as a bridge to cross the stream, although he was severely bruised in the process and eventually died.

India has also had rich ‘oral traditions’, that is, teachings or practices transmitted through everyday practice, without written texts (this is the case of the Vedas). Among them are numerous folk traditions, that is, transmitted by common people, and tribal traditions, transmitted by tribes. What is a tribe? There are many definitions for this social entity. Today, anthropologists usually consider a tribe to be a group of families or clans sharing a tradition of common descent, a culture and a language, living as a close-knit community under a chief and holding no private property. Interestingly, ancient India did not have a word for ‘tribe’ — tribes were just different janas that lived in a specific environment, such as forests or mountains. The Constitution of India uses the terms ‘tribes’ and ‘tribal communities’ in English, and janjāti in Hindi. According to official figures, in 2011 India had 705 tribes spread over most States, amounting to a population of about 104 million people — more than the populations of Australia and the United Kingdom together!

Deities, concepts, legends and rituals have been freely exchanged in both directions. For instance, according to tradition, Jagannath, worshipped at Puri (Odisha), was originally a tribal deity; this is also the case with various forms of the mother-goddess worshipped across India. Some tribes, on the other hand, adopted Hindu deities long ago, and possess their own versions of the Mahābhārata and the Rāmāyaṇa — this has been well documented from India’s northeastern States, all the way to Tamil Nadu. How have such interactions taken place for so long and so naturally? It is, in the end, because folk, tribal and Hindu belief systems have many similar concepts. For instance, in all three, elements of nature such as mountains, rivers, trees, plants and animals, and some stones too, are regarded as sacred, because there is consciousness behind all of them. Indeed, tribes generally worship many deities associated with those natural elements. For the Toda tribals of the Nilgiris of Tamil Nadu, for instance (one of them is pictured in the image on the right), over thirty peaks of this mountain range are residences of a god or a goddess; those peaks are so sacred that the Todas avoid pointing to them with a finger.

There are many more such examples. The Indian sociologist André Béteille summed up this situation in these words: “The thousands of castes and tribes on the Indian subcontinent have influenced each other in their religious beliefs and practices since the beginning of history and before. That the tribal religions have been influenced by Hinduism is widely accepted, but it is equally true that Hinduism, not only in its formative phase but throughout its evolution, has been influenced by tribal religions.” Clearly, the result of this long interaction has been mutual enrichment. In this manner, folk and tribal beliefs and practices also count among India’s cultural roots. We will further develop this point in the next chapter.

DON’T MISS OUT For a very long time, India produced the finest cotton in the world and Indian textiles were exported as far away as Europe. One beautiful type of printed cotton called ‘chintz’ became so popular in 17th-century Europe that the sale of some European dresses dropped sharply. Eventually, to protect their own products, England and France decided to ban the import of chintz from India! There are many ways of wearing the sari, as they vary from one region to another or from one community to another. In fact, new ways of draping it are still being invented.

Make a list of the few main ones and their various names in different parts of the country. An Epic Spread Literature offers us another fine illustration of unity in diversity. Indian literatures are extremely diverse (and among the most abundant in the world). Over centuries, despite differences in language, technique, etc., they have shared important themes and concerns. Who has not heard of the Pañchatantra, for example? This collection of delightful stories, with animals as the main characters, teaches us important life skills. The original Sanskrit text is at least 2,200 years old, but its stories have been adapted in almost every Indian language. In fact, they have travelled well beyond India, all the way to Southeast Asia, the Arab world and Europe, inspiring new collections of stories on the way — it is estimated that about 200 adaptations of the Pañchatantra exist in more than 50 languages! This illustrates how ‘one’ collection of stories has become ‘many’. The most striking case, however, is that of India’s two epics — the Rāmāyaṇa and the Mahābhārata. Epic: A long poem generally narrating the adventures of heroes and other great figures of the past. These two long Sanskrit poems, which together might fill some 7,000 pages in their original versions, narrate the stories of heroes who fight to re-establish dharma. In the Mahābhārata, the Pāṇḍavas, with Kṛiṣhṇa’s help, fight their own cousins, the Kauravas, to recover their kingdom. In the Rāmāyaṇa, Rāma, with the help of his brother Lakṣhmaṇa and of Hanuman, defeats the demon Rāvaṇa, who had kidnapped his wife Sītā. These stories contain many shorter ones that focus on values, and constantly ask questions about what is right and what is wrong. Reprint 2025-26"}

When a large number of people live together, there can be disagreements and disorder, and rules become necessary to maintain order and harmony in the society. There are probably some simple rules at home that you are expected to follow. The school where you study has rules too — some for students, others for teachers. In higher classes, students appearing for examinations must follow certain rules. Drivers on the road are expected to obey traffic rules. People employed in all kinds of jobs also need to follow the rules set by their employer, while the employers must also follow rules which they have committed to their employees.

Three Organs of Government All over the world, digital technologies have been transforming the way societies function. In India, till about 30 years ago, people who wanted to transfer money to a distant relative would have to queue up at the Post Office to send a money order after filling up a form; or if they had to send a payment to some business, they would queue up at their bank to obtain a demand draft, which would then have to be sent by post. You have probably never heard these terms (‘money order’ or ‘demand draft’), because today we have digital means of sending across money instantly! However, this has also created a new class of criminals who, without even leaving their desks, find digital ways of stealing people’s money. This has led many governments to pass new laws in order to fight such criminal activities (called ‘cybercrime’). Some of those criminals, who believe in robbing innocent people of their hard-earned money instead of using their skills to contribute to the society, have been arrested and convicted in court. They are usually fined as well as jailed for some years. Through this example, we can see how the three branches or ‘organs’ of a government work together:  The legislature is the organ that makes new laws (or ‘legislates’). Sometimes it also updates or removes Reprint 2025-26"}

This is done by an assembly of represen- tatives of the people. We will soon see how the Indian system works.  The executive is the organ that implements (or ‘executes’) the laws. This includes the head of state (who may be a president, a prime minister or a chief minister), the ministers and any agency responsible for enforcing ‘law and order’. (In our example above, that agency is the cyber police.)  The judiciary is the system of courts which decides whether someone has broken the law and, if so, what course of action should be taken, including punishment if necessary. Sometimes it also examines whether a decision taken by the executive is right, or whether a law passed by the legislature is well conceived and fair to all. LET’S EXPLORE Explain how the three government organs are at work in the case of the cybercriminals described above. How do they intervene? In a good system of governance, these three organs must be kept separate, although they interact with each other and work together. This separation is called the ‘separation of powers’ (Fig. 10.3). It is intended to provide a system of checks and balances. This means that each organ of the government can check what the other is doing and restore balance if one organ acts beyond its expected role.

To use a comparison, if a bulb in your home is not lighting up, you will first check the bulb, switch, fuse, etc. If that does not work, you may call an electrician, and if it is found that the problem is not within your home, you may need to go to the Electricity Board and file a complaint. These are also three levels of dealing with a problem.

This is one of the foundation stones of the system of governance adopted by most countries of the world — democracy. The word ‘democracy’ comes from two Greek words — dēmos meaning ‘people’, and kratos meaning ‘rule’ or ‘power’; so ‘democracy’ literally means the ‘rule of the people’. But can all people actually rule? It is clearly not possible. Imagine there is a problem that your class wants to bring to the attention of your school’s principal — maybe there is something wrong with the classroom, or with the school’s infrastructure, or perhaps you would like to propose a certain date for a field trip. Will the entire class go to the principal? It would clearly not be practical. In many schools, classes have a ‘class monitor’ or ‘class representative’, whom the whole class elected; even if there is none, one representative can be selected for this specific purpose. It will be enough to send the representative to the principal. It is the same principle at the State or national levels ̶ through elections, people vote for representatives, who will be the elected members of their respective assemblies. They are generally called ‘Members of Legislative Assembly’ (or MLAs) at the State level, and ‘Member of Parliament’ (or MPs) at the national level. All these members discuss laws, problems and solutions in the assemblies, and, through dialogue and debate, try to convince each other whenever there are different opinions.

Panchayats bring governance closer to the people, making it possible for them to actively participate in decision-making processes. That is why the Panchayat system, also known as Panchayati Raj, is a form of self-government.

Child-Friendly Panchayat Initiative Panchayats are supposed to listen to everyone’s voice — including the voice of children. The Child-Friendly Panchayat Initiative creates opportunities for children to express their ideas and opinions on matters that concern their wellbeing. Steps are being taken in several States to encourage the participation of children in Bal Sabhas and Bal Panchayats on a regular basis, while village elders try to find solutions to their concerns. In Maharashtra, for example, a few Bal Panchayats have worked to eliminate child labour and child marriage. They have brought many children back to school. The Bal Panchayat members get together to convince parents and other adults to send their wards back to school, and not to arrange marriages for girls who should be studying.

The composition of the Panchayat Samitis differs from State to State, but their role in strengthening the participation of local people remains the same. They coordinate matters across Gram Panchayats, for instance, by collecting development plans from all Gram Panchayats and putting them together to present them at the District or State levels respectively. This facilitates the allotment of funds for such development projects and for government schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, which promotes the construction of all-weather roads in rural areas.

For example, earlier most people were involved in activities such as agriculture, livestock rearing, production of tools, pottery and weaving cloth. As societies progressed, the number of economic activities through which people earn their livelihoods increased vastly. Today, there are diverse economic activities such as manufacturing computers, mobile phones and drones; working in banks, schools and hotels; driving various types of vehicles for transportation; making furniture; tailoring clothes using machines; creating software; repairing refrigerators and washing machines; etc. Classifying all these activities helps us to understand how they function and the links they have with each other. The Classification of Economic Activities into Economic Sectors Some economic activities share similar characteristics and based on this, they can be grouped together or classified into broader groups called economic sectors. The three main types of economic sectors are primary, secondary and tertiary economic sectors. The illustration on the facing page maps out the broad activities under these categories. A. Primary activities Those economic activities in which people are directly dependent on nature to produce goods are known as primary activities or primary sector economic activities.

Let us go on an imaginary excursion to a village in Anand district of Gujarat to study an interesting example where we will understand how the three sectors are interconnected and support each other. Dairy: A place where milk is collected and stored. Services at airports Retail stores Dairy cooperative: from farm to plate These days, farmers in Gujarat greet the day with the clinking of milk pails and the happy moos of their best friends, their cows or buffaloes! Cows have a special place in the lives of the farmers and their families. The farmers milk the cows and sell their milk to the dairy nearby. At the end of the month, they get paid for the milk based on its quantity and quality. However, this was not the case about 50 years ago. This is the amazing story of a milk cooperative named Anand Milk Union Limited (AMUL). In the early 1940s, farmers in Anand district would sell milk to the neighbouring villages. Reprint 2025-26"}

They own the cooperative and decisions are taken by the members collectively. Middlemen: Persons who buy goods from producers and sell them to consumers. The middlemen charge a fee for this service. They would have to cycle or walk to nearby villages to sell the milk under scorching heat. As you know, milk spoils or curdles very fast in hot weather. The farmers had to sell the milk quickly before it could spoil. This was a lot of effort for the small amount of money they would earn. So, they depended on people called middlemen, who would buy the milk in bulk at meagre prices from the farmers and sell it in the market. Many times, the farmers felt cheated and harassed by the middlemen. One day, the farmers collectively approached Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, a prominent national leader, with their problems. He advised them to form a cooperative to become independent and stop relying on the middlemen. As a cooperative, the farmers would be able to buy and sell milk as a group, taking care of the entire operation of milk collection, processing and distribution themselves. The farmers took Sardar Patel’s advice. AMUL was set up in 1946 under the leadership of Tribhuvandas Patel (lawyer and freedom fighter) and Dr. Varghese Kurien (an engineer who was working at a dairy factory in Mumbai).

The milk producers collectively made their own decisions on all matters such as production, pasteurisation and sale of milk. The tasks were shared by everyone, which helped raise their income gradually. They did not need the middlemen anymore and became like one big family! As more and more farmers began to see the benefits of the cooperative, it continued to grow. The quantity of milk that was being collected was so huge that the farmers decided to make other products out of it. They set up a factory in Anand, and began to produce butter and milk powder. Today, the cooperative has a wide range of products made at many milk processing plants and factories all over India. Can you name a few? The products are then transported and sold in both small and large retail shops all over the country. In fact, they also export the products to several countries around the world. Is it not amazing? In this fascinating story, the farmers of this cooperative milk their cows to sell the milk later. This kind of economic activity is called a primary sector economic activity because the product (milk) is derived directly from a natural source (cows/livestock). Pasteurisation: A process by which milk is preserved through heating to a specific temperature to kill harmful bacteria. Factory: Building or group of buildings where goods are manufactured, or various components are put together, to make a final product.
