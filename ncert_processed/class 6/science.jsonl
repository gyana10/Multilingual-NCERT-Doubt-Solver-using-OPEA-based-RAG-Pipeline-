The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured the students’ inherent abilities touching upon all the five planes of human existence, the pañchakośhas, in the Foundational and the Preparatory Stages have paved the way for the progression of their learning further at the Middle Stage. Thus, the Middle Stage acts as a bridge between the Preparatory and the Secondary Stages, spanning three years from Grades 6 to 8. This framework, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages—including at least two languages native to India—to Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy—a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made Reprint 2025-26"}

Curiosity, Textbook of Science for Grade 6, is one of these. It has been developed in consonance with the recommendations of NEP 2020 and the NCF-SE 2023 to take students on a journey of experiential learning by citing examples from the world of the learners. The content stimulates curiosity, a sense of exploration, questioning, and critical thinking. The content seamlessly weaves together concepts from physics, chemistry, biology, and earth science, along with cross-cutting themes like environmental education, value education, inclusive education, and Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS). The textbook aims to engage learners through an integrated approach by including multiple activities and thoughtful use of technology. The textbook offers ample opportunities for reflection and group discussions. To encourage creativity and innovation, it is feasible to regard students as active participants in the learning process, rather than mere recipients of a predetermined set of knowledge. This can only be achieved if the necessary number of hours are dedicated to science teaching–learning annually as outlined in NCF-SE 2023. The pedagogical approach of the textbook also considers how important it is for students to think critically, reason well and make decisions. It also provides students with numerous opportunities to learn from each other, making the learning experience more engaging for both teachers and students. However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years.

{"class": "class 6", "subject": "science", "page_no": 5, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "About the Book Curiosity, Textbook of Science for Grade 6 learners has been crafted in alignment with the recommendations of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023. The policy advocates a radical shift from a content-based education to a competency-based education, particularly in the realm of science. Therefore, the formulation of curricular goals for Science, subsequent competencies and learning outcomes are tailored towards competency-based learning. These curricular goals encompass various scientific concepts, including matter, the physical and living world, health, hygiene, and the exploration of the interface between science, society and technology. Additionally, the goals focus on the nature of science, its processes, historical and contemporary aspects of the development of science and science communication. While these goals are explicitly articulated, they are interdependent and collectively contribute to a better understanding of the world around us. Accordingly, the chapters of this textbook are structured around creative activities, reflective questions, processes and illustrations. The integration of the concepts from biology, chemistry, physics and earth science, and cross-cutting themes, such as value education, inclusive education, Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS) and environmental education have been interwoven in the content. Thus, the textbook aims to provide experience-based learning, rather than simply reading and memorising the concepts. In the Middle Stage, science teaching–learning adopts an integrated approach. This integrated approach develops fundamental capacities across biology, chemistry, physics and earth science. The use of an integrated approach helps the learners to appreciate the interrelations between subjects and make sense of their observations and experiences. Curiosity, Textbook of Science for Grade 6, comprises twelve chapters. As the name of the textbook suggests, there are numerous opportunities for the learners to explore the world of science and its nature. Through the chapters, learners will embark on a journey that will connect them to the world around and spark curiosity for further exploration.

Some activities require both the teacher and learners to prepare in advance. Chapter 1, titled ‘The Wonderful World of Science’, provides a holistic view of the new topic of Science introduced in the Middle Stage. It showcases, through examples, the essence of Science—a way of thinking, observing, and finding out by doing, and by asking questions. This chapter weaves together the concepts covered in the rest of the book, and aims to excite the readers as they start their adventures into the world of science. There are no assessment exercises in this chapter and is designed to be non-evaluative. Also, every chapter in the book begins with an introduction that makes the learners curious and tries to show different ways with which the goals of the curriculum can be achieved effectively. The chapters begin with the stories related to real-life situations, these are meant to capture learners’ interest and connect them with what is already known. The various activities given are based on scientific processes, designed to provide hands and minds-on experiences. Following each activity, there are questions to help learners understand and assess how well they have grasped the information. Questions are significant in the learning process. They help learners to explore and reinforce their understanding. One will also find many thought-provoking questions designed to encourage deep thinking, self-awareness and critical analysis. These questions prompt learners to ponder and delve deeper into their thoughts. In order to sustain the interest of the readers, some of the challenging ideas, additional information, poems, stories, strange facts and other interesting materials are also presented as add on non-evaluative content in the boxes labelled ‘Do you know?’, ‘More to know!’, ‘Think it over!’ and ‘More to do!’. The thrill of scientific inquiry comes from pursuing the unknown, giving learners the opportunity to think and explore beyond the syllabus. Some chapters also include a section called ‘Know a scientist’, which presents the contributions of Indian scientists related to that concept.

The keywords related to scientific processes depict the steps or procedure involved in the scientific activities. These words guide learners on how scientific knowledge is generated, tested and applied. ‘Summary’ offers an overview of the chapter’s main points, reinforcing the key ideas discussed. It serves to outline the content presented in the chapter. A non-evaluative interesting element that has been incorporated in some of the chapters is the introduction of certain verses from various Indian texts to promote rootedness in the learners as envisaged in NEP 2020. The primary aim of Curiosity is to prepare the children for becoming the responsible members of the society, and therefore efforts have been made to raise awareness about various issues, such as gender, region, environment, health and hygiene, water scarcity and energy conservation. Activities given in the book endeavour to promote peer-learning and group activities. The assessment exercises, ‘Let us enhance our learning’, play a vital role in the learning process. They help to reinforce the understanding and identify areas for improvement, making them essential components of effective teaching and learning. Assessment consists of various exercises, from pictorial questions to creating puzzles and multiple-choice questions, to create a challenging and interesting experience for the learners. These questions also facilitate the evaluation of various competencies expected to be developed through a particular chapter. Peer and group activities to explore answers to the questions are also encouraged. A significant feature of the book is what we termed as ‘Learning further’. In this section, some projects and activities are designed to increase learners’ interaction with experts, teachers, parents and the wider community. Learners are encouraged to gather diverse information and draw their own conclusions. The textbook is just one way to learn. Learners should enhance their knowledge by exploring and observing their surroundings.

Whether you are learning about the structure of a leaf, discovering how things move, or separating the skin of a peanut seed, we hope each chapter of this book will ignite your spirit of inquiry. And hopefully you will have lots of questions on your mind! Even though you may have not realised, you have already been fi nding answers to many of your questions. Suppose your pen stops writing. What would you do? You would ask yourself the question, “Why did my pen stop writing?” You might guess that the ink fi nished. You would then test this guess by opening the pen and checking the ink refi ll. If it is empty, you would know that your guess was correct. But suppose you found that the ink was not fi nished. Now what would you do? You would make another guess—perhaps the ink might have dried up. To test if this guess is correct or not, you will try something else. This is exactly how Science works! The way you tried to fi nd out why your pen stopped writing is an example of the scientiﬁ c method.

You will learn more about the importance of grouping in our daily lives in the chapter, ‘Materials Around Us’. 2.2.1 How to group plants? You must have noticed that plants show variation in the features related to stems, leaves, flowers, and more. The stems of different plants vary in thickness, height, and hardness, while the leaves vary in shape, colour, size and arrangement. You might have tried grouping the plants in Activity 2.3 using one of these features. You might have also learnt in earlier classes that plants can be grouped into herbs, shrubs, and trees based on their height and types of stem. Let us study the features of plants in more detail and group them on that basis. Activity 2.4: Let us group   Let us go on a nature walk again for some more interesting observations.   Look closely at the height of different plants. Are these plants shorter than you, as tall as you, or taller than you?   Is the stem brown or green? Touch and feel the stems and try to bend them gently. Can you bend the stem easily, or is it stiff? Take care that the stems do not break.   Also, observe from where the branches of the plants arise—whether they arise close to the ground or higher up on the stem.

For example, a rose plant is a shrub (Fig. 2.3b). Some plants are typically small with soft and green stems. These are known as herbs. For example, a tomato plant is a herb (Fig. 2.3c). Some plants with weak stems need support to climb and grow, and are called climbers. Some plants creep along the ground and are called creepers.

What differences do you see in the veins of leaves shown in Fig. 2.4a and Fig. 2.4b? In some leaves, you can observe a net-like pattern of veins on both sides of a thick middle vein. This pattern is called reticulate venation. For example, leaves of hibiscus exhibit reticulate venation (Fig. 2.4a). In some leaves, you may observe that the veins run parallel.

Here, we have identified animals based on the types of movement and the body parts used for movement. How can we group animals based on their movements? Additionally, many animals differ from each other in shape, size, structure, colour, and other features. Some of these features can also be used to group animals in various ways. Like plants, grouping of animals is important for understanding their diversity. Janaki Ammal (1897–1984) was an Indian botanist dedicated to environmental work and helped to document and preserve India’s rich plant biodiversity. She played a key role in the ‘Save Silent Valley’ movement. As the head of the Botanical Survey of India, she initiated programmes to document the plant diversity of India.

Success Story—Save Silent Valley Movement This is a real story of a forest in the Palakkad district of Kerala.

The now-famous Silent Valley was saved by a remarkable movement led by common people who were not even residing in the vicinity of the forest. The battle against the proposal of a hydroelectric dam across the Kunthipuzha river persisted for 10 years. At that time, people used all possible available means, such as widespread awareness programmes, letters to editors, articles in, newspapers, seminars, and petitions and appeals in court. The movement was successful in saving the Silent Valley. 2.3 Plants and Animals in Different Surroundings You might have observed during nature walks that different animals live in different surroundings. You have also recorded movement of animals in Table 2.5. Does the movement of these animals depend upon their surroundings? Let us consider fishes and goat as examples. Fishes live in water. They have streamlined bodies and fins for movement in water (Fig. 2.8a). Goats live in grassy areas and move with the help of legs (Fig. 2.8b).

Why does the biodiversity of a region vary from that of another? Let us find out. There is very little water available in the deserts. A hot desert is typically very hot during the day and very cold at night. Therefore, you will find plants and animals in these areas that can tolerate and survive both the hot conditions during the day and cold conditions at night. The fleshy stems of plants found in the desert can store water and help them tolerate the hot conditions in these places. The mountains in extremely cold regions experience frequent snowfall. In order to survive in such conditions, some of the trees have the ability to let the snow slide off easily. Conical shape and sloping branches of deodar trees enable them to do so easily. You must have understood by now that the biodiversity varies from region to region because of diverse conditions. Look at the images of a camel from the hot desert of Rajasthan (Fig. 2.11) and a camel from the cold desert of Ladakh (Fig. 2.12). What are the differences you observe between them? What advantages do these differences provide to these camels? The camel of the hot desert has long legs with wide hooves. Alex shares that his grandmother told him that the long legs and wide hooves help these camels to walk on the sandy desert without sinking into the sand. On the other hand, the height and legs of camels of a cold desert are comparatively shorter than those found in a hot desert. These short legs allow them to walk easily in mountainous regions.

Camels store food in their humps. Camels found in the hot desert have one hump each that helps them to survive during the scarcity of food. Camels found in the cold desert have two humps each. These two humps shrink in late winters because there is not much food available in the cold desert and they have to use food stored in their humps during that time. Moreover, they grow long hair from head to neck, which help them survive the cold winters of Ladakh. What other features can help camels to survive in the desert? Other students also start sharing their observations. Kashi from Rajasthan says that camels excrete small amounts of urine, their dung is dry, and they do not sweat. As camels do not lose much water from their bodies, they can survive for many days without drinking water. Maya talks about seeing plants with beautiful bright flowers, rhododendrons, in the Shola forests of Nilgiris. Here, rhododendrons are of shorter height and have smaller leaves to survive through the heavy winds on mountain tops. However, Pema, who is from Sikkim, mentions that she has observed rhododendrons in the nearby mountains to be taller (Fig. 2.13). So, even plants such as rhododendrons may exhibit different features in different regions to survive the conditions of those regions.

The special features that enable plants and animals to survive in a particular region are called adaptations. The shape of the deodar tree and the height of the rhododendron are adaptations that enable them to survive in the mountainous regions. The place where plants and animals live is called their habitat. For example, the habitat of sea turtles is the sea or the ocean. The habitat of a camel is the hot or the cold desert, and the habitat of a rhododendron is the mountains. The habitat of plants and animals provides them food, water, air, shelter and other needs for their survival. Many types of plants and animals may share the same habitat. Habitat plays an important role in shaping the biodiversity of a region. What are the different ways in which you can group plants and animals based on their habitats? One way is to group them into those ‘that live on land’ and those ‘that live in water’. The plants and animals that live on land are said to live in terrestrial habitats. Some examples of terrestrial habitats are forests, deserts, grasslands, and mountains. Salim Ali (1896–1987) travelled across India to observe diversity in birds. He prepared a list of birds and documented their travel routes and habitats. He recorded the regions with high diversity of birds and took measures to conserve these regions. Keoladeo National Park in Bharatpur, Rajasthan and Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary in Mandya, Karnataka are examples of regions he preserved. He wrote a landmark series of 10 books on birds of the Indian Subcontinent. He is referred to as the ‘Birdman of India’. He was awarded Padma Vibhushan in 1976. Know a scientist Reprint 2025-26"}

Some examples of aquatic habitats are ponds, lakes, rivers, and oceans. Some animals, such as frogs, can live in water as well as on land. These are called amphibians. What would happen if the habitat of a plant or an animal is damaged? What would happen if a goat does not get grass to eat? Can a fish survive without water? Check with your parents, grandparents, and neighbours to know about the plants, birds, insects or any other animal they used to see frequently in their childhood but do not see as often now. These changes often happen when habitats are damaged. The damage to habitats of plants and animals results in loss of their homes, food, and other resources. This leads to the loss of biodiversity. The population of the Bengal Tiger, Cheetah, and Great Indian Bustard has declined in India due to loss of natural habitats caused by human activities. The Government of India has initiated several projects to conserve our biodiversity. ‘Project Tiger’ was initiated in 1973 to protect the declining population of the Bengal Tiger. The ‘Cheetah Reintroduction Project’ was initiated in 2022 to restore the population of the Cheetah.

During a voyage in 1746, Scottish physician James Lind observed that sailors who consumed lemons and oranges recovered from these symptoms. Bleeding and swollen gums are symptoms of a disease called scurvy. Case 2 In the 1960s, Indian scientists found that among the human population in the Himalayan region and the Northern plains of India, symptoms of swelling at the front of the neck were prevalent. As per norms of the Government of India, an effort was made to supplement common salt with iodine for preparing iodised salt. Consumption of iodised salt visibly reduced the above symptoms. These symptoms were due to a deficiency of iodine in the soil of this region resulting in a lack of iodine in the local food and water supply.

They are good sources of vitamins, minerals like iron and calcium, and dietary fibres as well. That is the reason they are also called nutri-cereals. They contribute significantly to a balanced diet required for the normal functioning of our body. Packaged food items must have information about the nutrients on their cover.

But in her story, a situation arose wherein the sailors got caught in a storm with an overcast sky and stars were not visible. Reshma could not take her story forward as she could not think of a way for sailors to find directions. She searched for information on the internet and her school library. She learnt that the travellers used a device, known as a magnetic compass, for finding directions. Reshma had seen pencil boxes and purses which had magnets to keep them closed. A writing board in her school also had a duster with a magnet. But she had never looked at those carefully. She now became curious to learn more about magnets and magnetic compasses.

The other end that points towards the South direction is called the South-seeking pole or the South pole of the magnet. A freely suspended magnet rests along the north-south direction because our Earth itself behaves like a giant magnet. Repeat this activity with a small iron bar in place of the bar magnet. What do you observe? Does it always rest along north-south direction? It does not. It can rest along any direction. This implies that only magnets rest along north-south direction. This activity provides us with a way to test whether a piece of metal is a magnet or not. The property of a freely suspended magnet to always rest along the north-south direction is used to find directions. Based on this, a small device called a magnetic compass was developed in olden days for finding directions. It has a magnet in the shape of a needle which can rotate freely (Fig. 4.6). The needle of a magnetic compass indicates the north-south direction. The compass is kept at the place where we wish to know the directions. After some time, the needle comes to rest in the north-south direction. The compass box is then gently rotated until the north and south marked on the dial are aligned with the needle. Now all directions at that place are as indicated on the dial. A magnetic compass is usually a small circular box with a transparent cover on it, as shown in Fig. 4.6. The magnet, in the shape of a needle, is mounted on a pin standing on the bottom of the box. This needle is balanced on the pin in such a manner that it can move around this point easily, that is, it can rotate freely.

Our handspans are of different sizes.” Anish gives an idea, “Let us check this.” So, all five of them put their handspans along each other and arrive at the conclusion that the lengths of their handspans are different. Deepa says thoughtfully, “No wonder people use scales and measuring tapes.” Deepa and her friends compare the length of the table with the length of their handspans. The length of the table is expressed in terms of their handspans. Here, the handspan used for measurement is an example of a unit. And the length is expressed in two parts, a number and a unit. For example, if the length of the table is found to be 13 handspans, then 13 is the number and ‘handspan’ is the unit selected for the measurement. However, handspans and other similar units, such as length of hand, foot, fist or fingers, differ from person to person. Thus, there is a need for such a unit for which measurements of the same length made by different people do not differ.

However, when people started travelling from one place to another, it created a lot of confusion. This led to the different countries coming together and adopting a set of standard units of measurement. The system of units now used is known as the ‘International System of Units’ or SI units. The SI unit of length is metre. Its symbol is m. A metre scale is shown in Fig. 5.2. One metre (m) is divided into 100 equal divisions. Each division is called a centimetre (cm). You may be familiar with a smaller part of the metre scale, typically 15 cm long, shown in Fig. 5.3. Look carefully at the 15-cm scale. It has markings (in cm) from 0 to 15.

You cannot directly measure the girth of a tree or the size of your chest using a metre scale. For such measurements, flexible measuring tape, such as a tailor’s tape is more suitable.

If the ends of the scale are broken or the zero marking is not clear, it can still be used for measurement. With such a scale, use any other full mark of the scale, say, 1.0 cm (Fig. 5.6). Then you must subtract the reading of this mark from the reading at the other end. For example, in Fig. 5.6, the reading at one end is 1.0 cm and at the other end, it is 10.4 cm.

About 4000 BCE onwards, Sindhu-Sarasvatī developed techniques of wheel- turned pottery production, pigmentation, application of protective or decorative coats (called ‘slips’) of multiple colours, decorative painting, etc. These techniques became further sophisticated during the Sindhu-Sarasvatī (also known as ‘Harappan’) Civilisation (2600–1900 BCE), with a bright red surface painted with black-coloured designs displaying geometric patterns, and aquatic and terrestrial animals. The clay used for making pots, dishes, bowls and other items was carefully selected and cleaned, sieved, kneaded, turned over a wheel and finally baked in kilns (baked clay is called ‘terracotta’). Pots were used for various purposes, from cooking to storage of food grains, oil, ghee, and so on.

Group the collected pieces based on their appearance. Materials that typically have shiny surfaces are said to have a lustrous appearance. Such materials with lustre are usually metals. Examples of metals include iron, copper, zinc, aluminium, gold, etc. However, some metals may lose their lustre and start to look dull or non-lustrous due to the effect of air and moisture on them. As a result, we often notice the lustre only on their freshly cut surfaces. Non-lustrous materials are those that do not have a shiny surface. Some examples of non-lustrous materials are paper, wood, rubber, jute, etc. “All that glitters is not gold” goes an old saying! Not all the materials that shine are metals. Surfaces of some materials are made shiny by polishing or coating them with thin layers of plastic, wax or any other material which makes them look shiny. These materials may not be metals. 6.3.2 Which materials are hard? When you press different objects or materials with your hands, some of them like stones, may be hard to compress, while others, like an eraser, can be easily compressed. Take a metal key and use it to scratch the surface of a piece of wood, aluminium, stone, iron, candle, chalk and any other material or object. Can some materials be scratched more easily than others? Materials which can be compressed or scratched easily are soft, while other materials which are difficult to compress or scratch are hard. However, these properties are relative in nature. For example, rubber is harder than sponge but softer than iron. Activity 6.5: Let us observe   Hold the objects given in Table 6.3 with your hands. Feel whether the objects are hard or soft.

Mass and volume are the two properties that are possessed by all materials. Can we give a general name to anything that possesses these two properties? Anything that occupies space and has mass is called matter. The mass gives the quantity of matter, and the units to measure it are gram (g) and kilogram (kg). The space occupied by matter is its volume. The units to measure the volume are litre (L) and millilitre (mL). Kilogram is the unit of mass in the International System of Units (SI). Kilogram is abbreviated in lower case as kg. There is no space between ‘k’ and ‘g’ in kg, and no full stop after the symbol, except at the end of a sentence. While writing the mass, always leave a space between the number (numerical value) and the unit. For example, if we have mass of 7 kilograms, it would be written as 7 kg and not as 7 kgs. Similarly, litre is abbreviated as capital L and millilitre as mL. There is no space between ‘m’ and ‘L’ in mL. For example, if you have 500 millilitres of water, it would be written as 500 mL, m will be in lower case and L will be in upper case. The SI unit for volume is cubic metre, abbreviated as m3. The abbreviation is written with a superscript 3 to denote cubic metre. For example, if you have volume of 2 cubic metres, it would be written as 2 m3.

We cannot always rely upon our sense of touch to decide correctly whether a body is hot or cold. 7.2 Temperature A reliable measure of hotness (or coldness) of a body is its temperature. A hotter body has a higher temperature than a colder body. The difference in temperature between the two bodies tells us how hot a body is in comparison to another body. A device that measures temperature is called a thermometer. There are two kinds of thermometers that you are likely to come across—clinical thermometers and laboratory thermometers. Clinical thermometers are used to measure human body temperatures whereas laboratory thermometers are used for many other purposes. Let us now learn more about thermometers and how to use them to measure temperature. 7.3 Measuring Temperature 7.3.1 Clinical thermometer You might be familiar with a thermometer, like that shown in Fig. 7.2, which is used for measuring our body temperature. It is called a clinical thermometer. Such thermometers show temperatures digitally. These are also known as digital clinical thermometers and run on batteries.

Earlier, mercury thermometers were used for measuring the body temperature. But mercury is an extremely toxic substance and is difficult to dispose of if the thermometer breaks accidently. Digital thermometers pose no such risk and also the numbers in its display are easier to read. Therefore, mercury thermometers are being replaced by digital thermometers. Temperature in a digital thermometer is determined with the help of heat sensors. temperature when the thermometer is placed in contact with a person’s body. For measuring temperature, the clinical thermometers generally use a scale called the Celsius scale. On this scale, the unit of temperature is degree Celsius and is denoted by °C. They are non-contact thermometers, also called infrared thermometers. Such thermometers can measure temperature without touching a person’s body and thus reduce the risk of spreading disease. During the COVID-19 pandemic, some special thermometers were used, which could measure the temperature of a person from a distance. What were those? Reprint 2025-26"}

But in this activity, did you find that the normal temperature of every person was 37.0 °C? Or did you find the temperature slightly higher or lower for some people? The temperature of every person may not be 37.0 °C. What we call normal temperature is the average body temperature of a large number of healthy people. A perfectly healthy person may, therefore, have a normal temperature slightly different from 37.0 °C. The body temperature is influenced by several factors, such as age, time of the day and activity level. You may try measuring your own temperature at different times of the day and on different days. Record the thermometer readings in your notebook. After a month, analyse your temperature record and see if there are any variations. If yes, try to think what might be the reasons for that. The temperature of human beings does not normally go below 35 °C or above 42 °C. For measuring the body temperature of small children or old people, the digital thermometer can also be placed in the armpit. The temperature measured this way is about 0.5 °C to 1 °C lower than the actual body temperature. There is another scale of temperature known as Fahrenheit scale. On this scale, the unit of temperature is degree Fahrenheit and is denoted by °F. A temperature measured as 37.0 °C on Celsius scale is equivalent to 98.6 °F on Fahrenheit scale. The Fahrenheit scale is not used in most scientific studies anymore. In scientific work, there is another scale of temperature known as Kelvin scale. On this scale, the unit for temperature is kelvin and is denoted by K. The SI unit of temperature is kelvin. Do small children generally have slightly higher body temperatures as compared to adults? ? Do old people, even when healthy, generally have lower body temperatures than young adults? ?

Water is a substance that can be observed in three different states in our daily life. In the solid state, it exists as ice. On heating, the ice melts and gets converted into its liquid state. On further heating, water gets converted into its gaseous state. Let us perform Activity 8.5 to identify the properties of different states of water.

Ice (solid state) retains its shape irrespective of the container in which it is placed while water takes the shape of the container. Ice does not flow or spread. Water (liquid state) flows and changes its shape. Water does not have a fixed shape. It takes up the shape of the container in which it is kept, but the volume of water remains constant. Does water also possess the property to spread? Yes, water also has the property to spread while keeping the volume constant. Water vapour (gaseous state) exhibits a property of spreading out in the entire available space. Gases do not possess a fixed shape. Water vapour exists even at room temperature; though it is invisible to us. It is present in the air around us. The water that evaporates during processes like drying of clothes or mopping of floors contribute to the water vapour in the air around us. You are now familiar with the three states of water. Some other substances also exhibit these states. For example, wax, oil and ghee. Let us look at some more examples of solids, liquids and gases. Look around and find some examples of solid substances. Some examples could be stones, wood and glass. What are the other examples of liquids you can think of? Here are two examples— milk and oil. Think of five more examples. Have you ever noticed that you can smell the food being cooked even without entering the kitchen? How does this smell reach us? It is because the smell of yummy food from cooking spreads through the air and reaches our nostrils, even if we are not in the kitchen. What are the other examples of gases you can think of? What about oxygen and carbon dioxide? 8.4 How can we change the States of Water? So far we have learnt that water can exist in solid, liquid and gaseous states. How can you change the state of water?

If we have to change ice into water, and water into water vapour, we have to supply heat to it. If we want to change water into ice, what should be done? It can be done by placing water in a cold environment, such as a freezer. Water freezes and is converted into ice. If we take the ice out of the freezer, it melts and is converted into water. Can you think of any other example, besides water, that can change from solid to liquid? A candle, which is made of wax, is one such example. How can we turn candle wax into liquid state? How can we change the liquid wax back into solid state? We should cool the liquid wax to change it into a solid. What are the other liquids you have seen which get converted into a solid? Have you ever seen coconut oil getting converted into its solid state during the winter season? Hence, we can see that water and other substances change their states on heating or cooling.

How does this happen? When air moves higher above the Earth’s surface, it becomes cooler and cooler. At certain heights, the air gets so cool that the water vapour in it turns into droplets which are generally formed around dust particles. These small droplets float in the air and form clouds. Many droplets join together to form bigger drops of water. Some drops get so heavy that they start falling. These falling water drops are what we call rain. Fig. 8.8: A surahi Why does air containing water vapour go up in the atmosphere (thin layer of air that surrounds the Earth)? As we know, gas balloons containing lighter gases go up in the air.

Count the number of breaths you take per minute after a normal walk, after a run, and after a few dance steps. Record the data and observe. Do you notice any difference in the number of breaths after each situation? Do you notice the process of breathing in other animals like dogs, cats, cows and buffaloes? Notice the movement of their abdomen while they are taking rest. In the process of breathing, when we inhale, the air moves from outside to inside our body. When we breathe out, the air moves from inside our body to outside. Breathing is part of a process called respiration. Do plants also respire?

For example, touch- me-not (mimosa, chhui-mui, lajjalu) plants fold their leaves when we touch them. Have you also observed that certain plants fold their leaves after sunset? Specifically, the leaves of certain plants facing each other tend to come together. This can be observed in the sleeping leaves of amla (Indian gooseberry) tree. All living beings respond to stimuli.

Let us understand how these conditions help in seed germination. The effects of the following conditions have been seen in Activity 10.2. Water: Seeds require water for germination. Water enables the seeds to carry out the processes necessary for their growth. The outer covering of the seed is called seed coat. Water softens the seed coat and helps the tiny embryo inside it to develop into a plant. Air and Soil: Seeds need air for germination. They use the air available in the spaces between soil particles. Moreover, spaces between the soil particles allow roots to grow easily. Light and/or dark conditions: We have learnt that for the bean seeds, presence of light is not essential for their germination.

Mosquitoes pass through four stages in their life cycle— egg, larva, pupa and adult (Fig. 10.6). The adult mosquito that emerges from the pupa rests briefly on the surface of water and then flies away. The adult mosquito may survive for 10 to 15 days. We have seen that a mosquito begins its life as an egg (stage I), the egg develops into a larva (stage II), the larva grows into pupa (stage III), and the pupa transforms into an adult mosquito (stage IV). The adult female mosquito lays eggs directly on or near water, and the cycle continues. Significant changes occur in the appearance, body shape and structure during the various stages in the life cycle of a mosquito. The shape of the egg is quite different from the larva; the larva appears very different from the pupa. The pupa appears very distinct from the adult mosquito. Is it easy to imagine that a mosquito emerges from a pupa? The silk moth also passes through four life stages—egg, larva, pupa and adult. Eggs hatch into larvae, which then grow in size. Larvae secrete thread-like material which they wrap around themselves, before changing to pupae. These are the fibres that are used to make silk fabric. In India, the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) has set up several centres for silk production.

Water harvesting is one of the methods for conserving water. In many buildings, rainwater is collected and stored in large quantities for later use. This is called rainwater harvesting (Fig. 11.4a). Do you know that rainwater is also harvested in many homes, residential societies or schools? It is an age-old practice in India. For example, stepwells (Fig. 11.4b), commonly known as Bawadi in Rajasthan and Vav in Gujarat are built for water harvesting as a response to the scarcity of water in these regions. These stepwells have a unique system of water harvesting. They store not only rainwater but also water seeping from nearby lakes, ponds and rivers. The walls of the trenches (long deep holes dug in the ground) are lined with blocks of stones that allow seepage of water. Find traditional water harvesting practices in your locality. Discuss with your teachers and parents to learn more about it. Fig. 11.4 (b): Bawadi (Toorji ka Jhalra, Jodhpur in Rajasthan) Fig. 11.4 (a): Rainwater harvesting Reprint 2025-26"}

We can use dried chillies when fresh ones are not available. I will give you some to take home. Do you know that the Sun is the main source of energy on Earth?

Let us explore. 11.4 Forests One morning, Ajji takes Bhoomi and Surya for a walk in the forest. They find a variety of herbs, shrubs and trees in the forest. Ajji explains, “Forests are large areas with dense growth of various types of plants.” On the way, they collect some nellikai (Kannada term for Indian gooseberries) that have fallen on the ground.

Forests are a natural home for many wild animals, including birds and insects. Forests provide food and shelter to them. In nature, every animal depends on other life forms for survival. The diversity of life forms ensures food for every living being. However, over the years, the forest cover has been decreasing, mainly due to human activities like large scale cutting of trees. It takes many years to grow a new forest or restore lost forests. Therefore, we must preserve and use forests responsibly so that they get enough time to regenerate. Van Mahotsav is a week- long event celebrated across the country during the month of July. It is a forest festival during which new plants and trees are planted, and awareness about respecting forests is raised. The aim of the event is to increase the green cover. You too can plan a Van Mahotsav in your community. From ancient times, India had a tradition of respecting, protecting and preserving forests. You have already learnt about sacred groves in the chapter ‘Diversity in the Living World’. Many efforts have been made by common people to prevent the cutting of trees, and thus, saving forests. One such effort is the famous Chipko movement. It started in the early 1970s in Uttarakhand (previously part of Uttar Pradesh). Local women actively participated in this movement. They encircled and hugged the trees to protect them from being felled. Do you know? What are the consequences of cutting a large forest area?

Ajji explains, “The roots of plants hold on to the soil and prevent it from being washed away. The leaves that fall from the trees decay and enrich the soil with nutrients. This soil is used by new plants and trees to grow. This is an example of recycling in nature.” Let us investigate the soil in more detail. 11.5 Soil, Rocks and Minerals Bhoomi, Surya and Ajji come back home from the forest. Bhoomi and Surya help Ajji in preparing the soil in the garden for planting some vegetables (Fig. 11.5). Ajji asks them to dig the soil gently and loosen the lumps. You have already learnt in the chapter ‘Living Creatures: Exploring their Characteristics’ that for plants to grow, the space between the soil particles not only provides sufficient air but also space for the roots to grow easily. Bhoomi and Surya could see small pebbles, the roots of plants and a few earthworms too in the soil. Do you realise that earthworms are natural agents that help in turning and loosening the soil?

They are formed essentially from the remains of microorganisms and plants that got buried deep inside the earth, and were converted to petroleum, natural gas and coal. It takes millions of years for these fuels to form. Natural gas is used for cooking and generating electricity. Nowadays, it is also used in the form of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) as a fuel for vehicles. It is a cleaner fuel than petrol or diesel. Coal is mainly used for the production of electricity.

Over-dependence on fossil fuels for transportation and as domestic fuels has resulted in large scale air pollution. 11.7 Natural Resources: renewable and non-renewable Nature’s treasures fulfill our needs. They are essential resources to sustain all life forms on the Earth. For example, we get heat and light from the Sun, water from rivers, and food from plants and animals. These resources which we get from nature are called natural resources. We also use natural resources to make many useful things for our convenience. For example, electric bulbs, furniture, solar panels, bicycles, etc., make our lives comfortable. All such resources created by human beings are called human-made resources.

If you remember, Ajji told Bhoomi and Surya that they could collect only those nellikai that had fallen on the ground. This makes sure that there would be enough fruits for other animals and birds. The seeds from the droppings of animals and birds would enable new trees to grow, though it would take some years before we get fruits from these new trees. Thus, resources which get renewed, replenished or restored within a reasonable period of time are called renewable resources. Air, water and forest are some of the examples of renewable natural resources. Nature renews them. We should use our natural resources judiciously. On the other hand, fossil fuels take millions of years to form. They are found in limited quantities and once used, they get exhausted. They are not produced or replenished within a reasonable period of time. These resources are called non-renewable resources. Examples of non-renewable natural resources are minerals, soil, rocks, coal, petroleum and natural gas. 11.8 Resources we use It is time for Bhoomi and Surya to go back home after a wonderful holiday at their Ajji’s home. Their Amma (mother) comes to pick them up. Bhoomi and Surya show her the vegetable plants that have started to grow in the garden and the dried chillies given by Ajji to take home. They notice changes in the colour of the skyline and the smell of the air once they reach the city. There are very few trees. The air does not smell as good as the air at Ajji’s place. They can smell smoke from the vehicles. The air is polluted. Amma says, “Yes. When we use fossil fuels in our vehicles, smoke is generated. Now, there are vehicles which cause less pollution.

Some stars are bright and others are dim. Stars shine with their own light. Some groups of stars appear to form patterns which are like shapes of familiar things. Long ago, when watching stars in the night sky was a favourite pastime of our ancestors, they identified these star patterns with animals, things or characters in stories. Many cultures had names for patterns based on their own stories. These imaginary shapes helped them in recognising stars in the sky. Recognising stars and their patterns was a useful skill for navigation in the olden times. Before the arrival of modern technology or even before the invention of the magnetic compass, it helped people, particularly sailors and travellers, in finding directions at sea or on land. It is still used in emergencies as a backup method. In earlier times, groups of stars forming patterns were called constellations. Currently, the regions of sky, which include these groups of stars, are defined as constellations. However, since in constellations, the patterns of stars are often the most prominent, the term constellation is still commonly used for these groups of stars. Do we find patterns among the stars just for fun or is there some use of these patterns? Since different cultures denoted the constellation boundaries in different ways, an internationally agreed set of constellation boundaries were defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in the early twentieth century. 88 constellations were officially listed, thus, dividing the entire sky into 88 regions. These regions of sky are now defined as constellations. More to know! Some constellations are shown in Fig. 12.3. The stars are joined by imaginary lines, drawn for easy identification.

If you stay in a big city, you may find that the sky is rarely clear and only a few stars are seen in the night sky. This is due to light pollution, smoke and dust. The presence of excessive artificial light at night time is referred to as light pollution. In villages or areas where there is less light pollution, a larger number of stars can be seen. Also, your house may be surrounded by tall buildings and trees, which may block your view. The night sky is best viewed from open dark areas. Light pollution is growing sharply globally. This is reducing our ability to enjoy and study objects in the night sky. Some dark sky reserves and parks have been established around the world.

To find out when and in which portion of the sky a star or a constellation will be visible from your location, you may take the help of sky mapping apps that can be downloaded on a mobile phone, or other online resources. Sky Map is a very handy app for identification of stars, constellations and planets from mobile phones. Stellarium is another such app. The computer version of Stellarium is free for download and has many features. More to know!

In India, the Sun is worshipped as Sūrya. The heat provided by the Sun keeps the Earth at a temperature that makes life possible. Sunlight is essential for plants to grow, which provide food and oxygen to animals, including humans. The Sun is responsible for climate, seasons, weather, water cycle, winds—all of which are important for sustaining life on the Earth. The distance of the Sun from the Earth is about 150 million km. A useful unit for expressing distances within the solar system is ‘astronomical unit’ (au) which is approximately the distance between the Sun and the Earth. The Sun produces heat and light, and is the main source of energy on the Earth (Fig. 12.6). How big is the Sun? It is about 100 times bigger than the Earth in diameter. And still, it looks so small because it is very far from the Earth. However, the Sun is much closer to us than the other stars hence it appears much bigger than the stars. As the stars (other than the Sun) are much farther away, they appear like points, even though some of those stars are much bigger Our Sun is also a star.

Mars is called the Red Planet because it appears red. This is because the soil on Mars is reddish in colour. A large portion of the Earth’s surface is covered with water and thus, it appears blue from the space. Due to this, the Earth is also called the Blue Planet. The four outermost planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune—are much larger compared to the Earth, and are mostly made of gases. These giant gaseous planets have large flat ring-like structures around them which are made of dust particles and rocky material. Planets get most of their energy from the Sun. So, the farther they are, the colder they are in general. The presence of an atmosphere on a planet can trap heat which can significantly change the temperature of a planet. That is why Venus, for example, is hotter than Mercury, although it is farther from the Sun. There is another object called Pluto that lies farther than Neptune, and revolves around the Sun. It is smaller than the Earth’s Moon. When it was discovered, it was called a planet of the Solar System. But later, when similar more small objects were discovered, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 2006 redefined the requirements of an object to be called a planet. As per this definition, these smaller objects, including Pluto, are now called dwarf planets. More to know! Can we identify a planet also, the way we identified the constellations?

The Sun—our star—is the largest and the heaviest object in the Solar System. The Sun produces almost all the energy in the Solar System. All other objects in our Solar System shine due to the sunlight that they reflect from their surfaces. In Sanskrit and a few other Indian languages, a comet is called Dhūmaketu. Various tribes in India also call it Pucchya-Taro (star with a tail) or Zendya- Taro (star like a flag). In many cultures, comets have been feared and it was earlier believed that comets bring bad luck.
