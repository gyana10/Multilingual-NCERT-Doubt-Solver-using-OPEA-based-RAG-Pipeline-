Mathematics is, in large part, the search for patterns, and for the explanations as to why those patterns exist. Such patterns indeed exist all around us — in nature, in our homes and schools, and in the motion of the sun, moon, and stars. They occur in everything that we do and see, from shopping and cooking, to throwing a ball and playing games, to understanding weather patterns and using technology. The search for patterns and their explanations can be a fun and creative endeavour. It is for this reason that mathematicians think of mathematics both as an art and as a science. This year, we hope that you will get a chance to see the creativity and artistry involved in discovering and understanding mathematical patterns. It is important to keep in mind that mathematics aims to not just find out what patterns exist, but also the explanations for why they exist. Such explanations can often then be used in applications well beyond the context in which they were discovered, which can then help to propel humanity forward. Reprint 2025-26"}

Such relationships can be helpful in studying and understanding both the shape sequence and the related number sequence. Example: The number of sides in the shape sequence of Regular Polygons is given by the counting numbers starting at 3, i.e., 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, .... That is why these shapes are called, respectively, regular triangle, quadrilateral (i.e., square), pentagon, hexagon, heptagon, octagon, nonagon, decagon, etc., respectively. The word ‘regular’ refers to the fact that these shapes have equal-length sides and also equal ‘angles’ (i.e., the sides look the same and the corners also look the same). We will discuss angles in more depth in the next chapter. The other shape sequences in Table 3 also have beautiful relationships with number sequences. Figure it Out 1.

What is the corresponding number sequence? (The answer is 3, 12, 48, ..., i.e., 3 times Powers of 4; this sequence is not shown in Table 1.)

Among the most basic patterns that occur in mathematics are number sequences. Some important examples of number sequences include the counting numbers, odd numbers, even numbers, square numbers, triangular numbers, cube numbers, Virahānka numbers, and powers of 2. Sometimes number sequences can be related to each other in beautiful and remarkable ways. For example, adding up the sequence of odd numbers starting with 1 gives square numbers. Visualising number sequences using pictures can help to understand sequences and the relationships between them. Shape sequences are another basic type of pattern in mathematics. Some important examples of shape sequences include regular polygons, complete graphs, stacked triangles and squares, and Koch snowflake iterations.

The word angle can be replaced by the symbol ‘∠’, i.e., ∠DBE or ∠EBD. Note that in specifying the angle, the vertex is always written as the middle letter. To indicate an angle, we use a small curve at the vertex (refer to Fig. 2.9). Vidya has just opened her book. Let us observe her opening the cover of the book in different scenarios.

So, the angle in Case 2 is greater as in this case she needs to rotate the cover more. Similarly, the angle in Case 3 is even larger than that of Case 2, because there is even more rotation, and Cases 4, 5, and 6 are successively larger angles with more and more rotation. The size of an angle is the amount of rotation or turn that is needed about the vertex to move the first ray to the second ray.

The Rigveda, one of the very oldest texts of humanity going back thousands of years, speaks of a wheel with 360 spokes (Verse 1.164.48). Many ancient calendars, also going back over 3000 years—such as calendars of India, Persia, Babylonia and Egypt—were based on having 360 days in a year. In addition, Babylonian mathematicians frequently used divisions of 60 and 360 due to their use of sexagesimal numbers and counting by 60s. Perhaps the most important and practical answer for why mathematicians over the years have liked and continued to use 360 degrees is that 360 is the smallest number that can be evenly divided by all numbers up to 10, aside from 7. Thus, one can break up the circle into 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 equal parts, and still have a whole number of degrees in each part! Note that 360 is also evenly divisible by 12, the number of months in a year, and by 24, the number of hours in a day. These facts all make the number 360 very useful.

A ray is a portion of a line starting at a point D and going in one direction indefinitely. It is denoted by DP where P is another point on the ray. An angle can be visualised as two rays starting from a common starting point. Two rays OP and OM form the angle ∠POM (also called ∠MOP); here, O is called the vertex of the angle, and the rays OP and OM are called the arms of the angle. The size of an angle is the amount of rotation or turn needed about the vertex to rotate one ray of the angle onto the other ray of the angle. The sizes of angles can be measured in degrees. One full rotation or turn is considered as 360 degrees and denoted as 360°. Degree measures of angles can be measured using a protractor. Angles can be straight (180°), right (90°), acute (more than 0° and less than 90°), obtuse (more than 90° and less than 180°), and reflex (more than 180° and less than 360°). Reprint 2025-26"}

We have used numbers to count, and have applied the basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on them, to solve problems related to our daily lives. In this chapter, we will continue this journey, by playing with numbers, seeing numbers around us, noticing patterns, and learning to use numbers and operations in new ways. Think about various situations where we use numbers. List five different situations in which numbers are used. See what your classmates have listed, share, and discuss. 3.1 Numbers can Tell us Things What are these numbers telling us? Some children in a park are standing in a line. Each one says a number.

Along with Class 6, her school also has Classes 7–10 and each class has 3 sections each. She assumed a similar number in each class and estimated the number of students in her school to be around 500. Figure it Out \u0007We shall do some simple estimates.

What is the method to fill a given table to get the maximum number of supercells? Explore and share your strategy. Ans. For even number of cells say,2,4,6,… the number of supercells would be respectively, 2/2 =1,4/2 =2,6/2=3,… For odd number of cells , say 1,3,5,7,… the number of supercells would be respectively (1+1)/2= 1, (3+1)/2 = 2, (5+1)/2= 3,(7+1)/2 = 4,… To get the maximum number ofsupercells, we have to start by filling the first cell as super cell & then fill alternately. Q6. Can you fill a supercell table without repeating numbers such that there are no supercells? Why or why not? Ans. No; the cell which is filled by the greatest number among the given numbers chosen, will become super cell irrespective of its position in the table. Q7. Will the cell having the largest number in a table always be a supercell? Can the cell having the smallest number in a table be a supercell? Why or why not? Ans. Yes, the largest number in a table will always be a supercell. No, the smallest number in a table can never be a supercell as the number in all the adjacent cells will be greater than it. Q8.

In this chapter, we will explore some of the ways that data is presented, and how we can use some of those ways to correctly display, interpret and make inferences from such data! 4.1 Collecting and Organising Data Navya and Naresh are discussing their favourite games. Cricket is my favourite game! I play cricket sometimes but hockey is the game I like the most. I think cricket is the most popular game in our class. I am not sure.

As we saw in pictographs, we can use a scale or key when the frequencies are larger. Let us look at an example of vehicular traffic at a busy road crossing in Delhi, which was studied by the traffic police on a particular day. The number of vehicles passing through the crossing each hour from 6 a.m. to 12:00 noon is shown in the bar graph.

Let’s try to prepare a bar graph to present his data — 1. \u0007First, we draw a horizontal line and a vertical line. On the horizontal line, we will write the name of each of the sweets, equally spaced, from which the bars will rise in accordance with their frequencies; and on the vertical line we will write the frequencies representing the number of students. 2. We must choose a scale. That means we must decide how many students will be represented by a unit length of a bar so that it fits nicely on our paper. Here, we will take 1 unit length to represent 1 student. 3. For jalebi, we therefore need to draw a bar having a height of 6 units (which is the frequency of the sweet jalebi), and similarly for the other sweets we have to draw bars as high as their frequencies.

Using a scale of 1 unit length = l run would mean that we have to go all the way from 0 to 100 runs in steps of l. This would be unnecessarily tedious. Instead, let us use a scale where 1 unit length = 10 runs. We mark this scale on the vertical line and draw the bars according to the scores in each match.

First, when making a visual presentation of data such as a pictograph or bar graph, it is important to make it fit in the intended space; this can be controlled, for example, by choosing the scale appropriately, as we have seen earlier. It is also desirable to make the data presentation visually appealing and easy-to-understand, so that the intended audience appreciates the information being conveyed. Let us consider an example. Here is a table naming the tallest mountain on each continent, along with the height of each mountain in meters. Continent Asia South America North America Africa Europe Antarctica Australia Tallest Mountain Everest Aconcagua Denali Kiliman- jaro Elbrus Vinson Massif Koscuiszko Height 8848m 6962m 6194m 5895m 5642m 4892m 2228m How much taller is Mount Everest than Mount Koscuiszko? Are Mount Denali and Mount Kilimanjaro very different in height? This is not so easy to quickly discern from a large table of numbers. As we have seen earlier, we can convert the table of numbers into a bar graph, as shown on the right. Here, each value is drawn as a horizontal box. These are longer or shorter depending on the number they represent. This makes it easier to compare the heights of all these mountains at a glance. Reprint 2025-26"}

A bar graph with vertical bars is also called a column graph. Columns are the pillars you find in a building that hold up the roof. Below is a column graph for our table of tallest mountains.

Similarly, lengths that are parallel to the ground (for example, distances between location on Earth) are usually best represented using bar graphs with horizontal arcs. Figure it Out 1.

Infographics When data visualisations such as bar graphs are further beautified with more extensive artistic and visual imagery, they are called information graphics or infographics for short. The aim of infographics is to make use of attention-attracting and engaging visuals to communicate information even more clearly and quickly, in a visually pleasing way. As an example of how infographics can be used to communicate data even more suggestively, let us go back to the table above listing the tallest mountain on each continent. We drew a bar graph with vertical bars (columns) rather than horizontal bars, to be more indicative of mountains. But instead of rectangles, we could use triangles, which look a bit more like mountains. And, we can add a splash of colour as well. Here is the result. Reprint 2025-26"}

The goal of our bar graph earlier was to represent the heights of various mountains — using bars of the appropriate heights but the same widths. The purpose of using the same widths was to make it clear that we are only comparing heights. However, in this infographic, the taller triangles are also wider! Are taller mountains always wider? The infographic is implying additional information that may be misleading and may or may not be correct. Sometimes going for more appealing pictures can also accidentally mislead. Taking this idea further, and to make the picture even more visually stimulating and suggestive, we can further change the shapes of the mountains to make them look even more like mountains, and add other details, while attempting to preserve the heights. For example, we can create an imaginary mountain range that contains all these mountains. Is the infographic below better than the column graph with rectangular columns of equal width? The mountains look more realistic, but is the picture accurate? For example, Everest appears to be twice as tall as Elbrus. Reprint 2025-26"}

Choosing the appropriate scale for a pictograph or bar graph is important to accurately and effectively convey the desired information or data and to also make it visually appealing. Other aspects of a graph also contribute to its effectiveness and visual appeal such as how colours are used, what accompanying pictures are drawn, and whether the bars are horizontal or vertical.

Guna can arrange 12 figs in a rectangular manner. 2. Anshu can arrange 7 figs in a rectangular manner. Guna has listed out these possibilities. Observe the number of rows and columns in each of the arrangements. How are they related to 12? In the second arrangement, for example, 12 figs are arranged in two columns of 6 each or 12 = 2 × 6. Anshu could make only one arrangement: 7 × 1 or 1 × 7. There are no other rectangular arrangements possible. In each of Guna’s arrangements, multiplying the number of rows by the number of columns gives the number 12. So, the number of rows or columns are factors of 12. We saw that the number 12 can be arranged in a rectangle in more than one way as 12 has more than two factors. The number 7 can be arranged in only one way, as it has only two factors — 1 and 7.

Step 1: Cross out 1 because it is neither prime nor composite. Step 2: Circle 2, and then cross out all multiples of 2 after that, i.e., 4, 6, 8, and so on.

Anshu and Guna: \u0007If they have a common factor other than 1, then they are not co-prime. Let us check. Anshu: \u0007I can write 56 = 14 × 4 and 63 = 21 × 3. So, 14 and 4 are factors, of 56. Further, 21 and 3 are factors of 63. So, there are no common factors. The numbers are co-prime. Guna: \u0007Hold on. I can also write 56 = 7 × 8 and 63 = 9 × 7. We see that 7 is a factor of both numbers, so, they are not co-prime. Clearly Guna is right, as 7 is a common factor. But where did Anshu go wrong? Writing 56 = 14 × 4 tells us that 14 and 4 are both factors of 56, but it does not tell all the factors of 56. The same holds for the factors of 63. Try another example: 80 and 63. There are many ways to factorise both numbers. 80 = 40 × 2 = 20 × 4 = 10 × 8 = 16 × 5 = ??? 63 = 9 × 7 = 3 × 21 = ??? We have written ‘???’ to say that there may be more ways to factorise these numbers. But if we take any of the given factorisations, for example, 80 = 16 × 5 and 63 = 9 × 7, then there are no common factors. Can we conclude that 80 and 63 are co-prime? As Anshu’s mistake above shows, we cannot conclude that as there may be other ways to factorise the numbers. What this means is that we need a more systematic approach to check if two numbers are co-prime. Reprint 2025-26"}

It is composite, as we saw that it can be written as 56 = 4 × 14 . So, both 4 and 14 are factors of 56. Now take one of these, say 14. It is also composite and can be written as 14 = 2 × 7. Therefore, 56 = 4 × 2 × 7. Now, 4 is composite and can be written as 4 = 2 × 2. Therefore, 56 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 7. All the factors appearing here, 2 and 7, are prime numbers. So, we cannot divide them further. In conclusion, we have written 56 as a product of prime numbers. This is called prime factorisation of 56. The individual factors are called prime factors. For example, the prime factors of 56 are 2 and 7. Every number greater than 1 has a prime factorisation. The idea is the same: keep breaking the composite numbers into factors till only primes are left. The number 1 does not have any prime factorisation. It is not divisible by any prime number. What is the prime factorisation of a prime number like 7? It is just 7 (we cannot break it down any further). Let us see a few more examples. By going through different ways of breaking down the number, we wrote 63 as 3 × 3 × 7 and as 3 × 7 × 3. Are they different? Not really! The same prime numbers 3 and 7 occur in both cases. Further, 3 appears two times in both and 7 appears once. Here, you see four different ways to get prime factorisation of 36. Observe that in all four cases, we get two 2s and two 3s.

We can use the prime factorisation of both numbers — 56 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 7 and 63 = 3 × 3 × 7 Now, we see that 7 is a prime factor of 56 as well as 63. Therefore, 56 and 63 are not co-prime. What about 80 and 63? Their prime factorisations are as follows: 80 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 and 63 = 3 × 3 × 7 There are no common prime factors. Can we conclude that they are co-prime?

Indeed, the prime factors of 40 are 2 and 5 while, the prime factors of 231 are 3, 7, and 11. Therefore, 40 and 231 are co-prime! Example: \u0007Consider 242 and 195.

Using prime factorisation to check if one number is divisible by another We can say that if one number is divisible by another, the prime factorisation of the second number is included in the prime factorisation of the first number. We say that 48 is divisible by 12 because when we divide 48 by 12, the remainder is zero. How can we check if one number is divisible by another without carrying out long division?

Find the prime factorisations of both: 168 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 7 and 12 = 2 × 2 × 3 Since we can multiply in any order, now it is clear that, 168 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 2 × 7 = 12 × 14 Therefore, 168 is divisible by 12.

The first few multiples of 10 are: 10, 20, 30, 40, … Continue this sequence and observe the pattern. Is 125 a multiple of 10? Will this number appear in the previous sequence? Why or why not? Can you now answer if 8560 is divisible by 10? Consider this statement: Numbers that are divisible by 10 are those that end with ‘0’. Do you agree? Divisibility by 5 The number 5 is another number whose divisibility can easily be checked. How do we do it? Explore by listing down the multiples: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ... What do you observe about these numbers? Do you see a pattern in the last digit? What is the largest number less than 399 that is divisible by 5? Is 8560 divisible by 5? Consider this statement: Numbers that are divisible by 5 are those that end with either a ‘0’ or a ‘5’. Do you agree? Divisibility by 2 The first few multiples of 2 are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, ... What do you observe? Do you see a pattern in the last digit? Math Talk Math Talk Reprint 2025-26"}

Do you agree? What are all the multiples of 2 between 399 and 411? Divisibility by 4 Checking if a number is divisible by 4 can also be done easily! Look at its multiples: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, … Are you able to observe any patterns that can be used? The multiples of 10, 5 and 2 have a pattern in their last digits which we are able to use to check for divisibility. Similarly, can we check if a number is divisible by 4 by looking at the last digit? It does not work! Look at 12 and 22. They have the same last digit, but 12 is a multiple of 4 while 22 is not. Similarly 14 and 24 have the same last digit, but 14 is not a multiple of 4 while 24 is. Similarly, 16 and 26 or 18 and 28. What this means is that by looking at the last digit, we cannot tell whether a number is a multiple of 4. Can we answer the question by looking at more digits? Make a list of multiples of 4 between 1 and 200 and search for a pattern. Find numbers between 330 and 340 that are divisible by 4. Also, find numbers between 1730 and 1740, and 2030 and 2040, that are divisible by 4. What do you observe? Is 8536 divisible by 4? Consider these statements: 1. Only the last two digits matter when deciding if a given number is divisible by 4. 2. If the number formed by the last two digits is divisible by 4, then the original number is divisible by 4. 3.

For example, 4 is a factor of 12 because 12 is divisible by 4 (12 ÷ 4 = 3). Prime numbers are numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, … that have only two factors, namely 1 and themselves. Composite numbers are numbers like 4, 6, 8, 9, … that have more than 2 factors, i.e., at least one factor other than 1 and themselves. For example, 8 has the factor 4 and 9 has the factor 3, so 8 and 9 are both composite. Every number greater than 1 can be written as a product of prime numbers. This is called the number’s prime factorisation. For example, 84 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 7. There is only one way to factorise a number into primes, except for the ordering of the factors. Two numbers that do not have a common factor other than 1 are said to be co-prime. To check if two numbers are co-prime, we can first find their prime factorisations and check if there is a common prime factor. If there is no common prime factor, they are co-prime, and otherwise they are not. A number is a factor of another number if the prime factorisation of the first number is included in the prime factorisation of the second number. Reprint 2025-26"}

Let us refresh our understanding! The perimeter of any closed plane figure is the distance covered along its boundary when you go around it once. For a polygon, i.e., a closed plane figure made up of line segments, the perimeter is simply the sum of the lengths of its all sides, i.e., the total distance along its outer boundary. The perimeter of a polygon = the sum of the lengths of its all sides. Let us revise the formulas for the perimeter of rectangles, squares, and triangles. Perimeter of a rectangle Consider a rectangle ABCD whose length and breadth are 12 cm and 8 cm, respectively. What is its perimeter?

From this example, we see that — Perimeter of a rectangle = length + breadth + length + breadth. Perimeter of a rectangle = 2 × (length + breadth). \u0007The perimeter of a rectangle is twice the sum of its length and breadth. Perimeter of a square Debojeet wants to put coloured tape all around a square photo frame of side 1m as shown. What will be the length of the coloured tape he requires? Since Debojeet wants to put the coloured tape all around the square photo frame, he needs to find the perimeter of the photo frame. Thus, the length of the tape required = perimeter of the square = sum of the lengths of all four sides of the square = 1 m + 1 m + 1 m + 1 m = 4 m. Now, we know that all four sides of a square are equal in length. Therefore, in place of adding the lengths of each side, we can simply multiply the length of one side by 4. \u0007Thus, the length of the tape required = 4 × 1 m = 4 m. From this example, we see that Perimeter of a square = 4 × length of a side. The perimeter of a square is quadruple the length of its side. Opposite sides of a rectangle are always equal.

Example: Akshi wants to put lace all around a rectangular tablecloth that is 3 m long and 2 m wide. Find the length of the lace required. Solution Length of the rectangular table cover = 3 m. Breadth of the rectangular table cover = 2 m. Akshi wants to put lace all around the tablecloth. Therefore, the length of the lace required will be the perimeter of the rectangular tablecloth. Now, the perimeter of the rectangular tablecloth = 2 × (length + breadth) = 2 × (3 m + 2 m) = 2 × 5 m = 10 m. Hence, the length of the lace required is 10 m.

Provide square grid papers to students and let them come up with the formula. Let’s see some real-life problems related to these ideas. Example: A floor is 5 m long and 4 m wide. A square carpet of sides 3 m is laid on the floor. Find the area of the floor that is not carpeted. Solution Length of the floor = 5 m. Width of the floor = 4 m. Area of the floor = length × width = 5 m × 4 m = 20 sq m. Length of the square carpet = 3 m. Area of the carpet = length × length = 3 m × 3 m = 9 sq m. Hence, the area of the floor laid with carpet is 9 sq m. Therefore, the area of the floor that is not carpeted is: area of the floor minus the area of the floor laid with carpet = 20 sq m – 9 sq m = 11 sq m.

It was also called bhaga or ansha meaning ‘part’ or ‘piece’. The way we write fractions today, globally, originated in India. In ancient Indian mathematical texts, such as the Bakshali manuscript (from around the year 300 CE), when they wanted to write 1 2, they wrote it as 1 2 which is indeed very similar to the way we write it today! This method of writing and working with fractions continued to be used in India for the next several centuries, including by Aryabhata (499 CE), Brahmagupta (628 CE), Sridharacharya (c. 750 CE), and Mahaviracharya (c. 850 CE), among others.

Over the next few centuries the notation then spread to Europe and around the world. Fractions had also been used in other cultures such as the ancient Egyptian and Babylonian civilisations, but they primarily used only fractional units, that is, fractions with a 1 in the numerator. More general fractions were expressed as sums of fractional units, now called ‘Egyptian fractions’. Writing numbers as the sum of fractional units, e.g., 19 24 = 1 2 + 1 6 + 1 8, can be quite an art and leads to beautiful puzzles. We will consider one such puzzle below. General fractions (where the numerator is not necessarily 1) were first introduced in India, along with their rules of arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and even division of fractions. The ancient Indian treatises called the ‘Sulba- sutras’ shows that even during Vedic times, Indians had discovered the rules for operations with fractions. General rules and procedures for working with and computing with fractions were first codified formally and in a modern form by Brahmagupta. Brahmagupta’s methods for working with and computing with fractions are still what we use today. For example, Brahmagupta described how to add and subtract fractions as follows: “By the multiplication of the numerator and the denominator of each of the fractions by the other denominators, the fractions are reduced to a common denominator. Then, in case of addition, the numerators (obtained after the above reduction) are added. In case of subtraction, their difference is taken.’’ (Brahmagupta, Brahmasphuṭasiddhānta, Verse 12.2, 628 CE) The Indian concepts and methods involving fractions were transmitted to Europe via the Arabs over the next few centuries and they came into general use in Europe in around the 17th century and then spread worldwide.

The reason is that 1 2 is the largest fractional unit, and 1 2 + 1 2 = 1. \u0007 To get different fractional units, we would have to replace at least one of the 1 2’s with some smaller fractional unit - but then the sum would be less than 1! Therefore, it is not possible for two different fractional units to add up to 1. \u0007 We can try to look instead for a way to write 1 as the sum of three different fractional units. 1. \u0007Can you find three different fractional units that add up to 1? \u0007It turns out there is only one solution to this problem (up to changing the order of the 3 fractions)! Can you find it? Try to find it before reading further. Here is a systematic way to find the solution. We know that 1 3 + 1 3 + 1 3 = 1. To get the fractional units to be different, we will have to increase at least one of the 1 3’s, and decrease at least one of the other 1 3’s to compensate for that increase. The only way to increase 1 3 to another fractional unit is to replace it by 1 2. So 1 2 must be one of the fractional units. Now 1 2 + 1 4 + 1 4 = 1. To get the fractional units to be different, we will have to increase one of the 1 4’s and decrease the other 1 4 to compensate for that increase.

Fractional Units: When one whole basic unit is divided into equal parts, then each part is called a fractional unit. Reading Fractions: In a fraction such as 5 6, 5 is called the numerator and 6 is called the denominator. Mixed fractions contain a whole number part and a fractional part. Number line: Fractions can be shown on a number line. Every fraction has a point associated with it on the number line. Equivalent Fractions: When two or more fractions represent the same share or number, they are called equivalent fractions. Lowest terms: A fraction whose numerator and denominator have no common factor other than 1 is said to be in lowest terms or in its simplest form. Brahmagupta’s method for adding fractions: When adding fractions, convert them into equivalent fractions with the same fractional unit (i.e., the same denominator), and then add the number of fractional units in each fraction to obtain the sum. This is accomplished by adding the numerators while keeping the same denominator. Brahmagupta’s method for subtracting fractions: When subtracting fractions, convert them into equivalent fractions with the same fractional unit (i.e., the same denominator), and then subtract the number of fractional units.

However, if you fold it, the two halves will not exactly overlap. On the other hand, if you rotate it by 90° about the red point at the centre, the windmill looks exactly the same. We say that the windmill has rotational symmetry. When talking of rotational symmetry, there is always a fixed point about which the object is rotated. This fixed point is called the centre of rotation. Will the windmill above look exactly the same when rotated through an angle of less than 90°? No! An angle through which a figure can be rotated to look exactly the same is called an angle of rotational symmetry, or just an angle of symmetry, for short. Reprint 2025-26"}

Another rotation through 180° from this position gives the original shape. This figure comes back to its original shape only after one complete rotation through 360°.

Recall that the very first numbers we learned about in the study of mathematics were the counting numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, … Then we learned that there are even more numbers! For example, there is the number 0 (zero), representing nothing, which comes before 1. The number 0 has a very important history in India and now in the world. For example, around the world we learn to write numbers in the Indian number system using the digits 0 to 9, allowing us to write numbers however large or however small using just these 10 digits. We then learned about more numbers that exist between the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, … , such as 1 2 , 3 2 , and 13 6 . These are called fractions. But are there still more numbers? Well, 0 is an additional number that we didn’t know about earlier, and it comes before 1 and is less than 1. Are there perhaps more numbers that come before 0 and are less than 0? Phrased another way, we have seen the number line: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 However, this is actually only a number ‘ray’, in the language we learned earlier in geometry; this ray starts at 0 and goes forever to the right.

To make it even more fun for them, Bela purchased a multi- storied building and filled it with attractions. She named it Bela’s Building of Fun. But this was no ordinary building! Observe that some of the floors in the ‘Building of Fun’ are below the ground. What are the shops that you find on these floors? What is there on the ground floor? A lift is used to go up and down between the floors. It has two buttons: ‘+’ to go up and ‘–’ to go down. Can you spot the lift? To go to the Art Centre from the ‘Welcome Hall’, you must press the ‘+’ button twice. We say that the button press is + + or + 2. To go down two floors, you must press the ‘–’ button twice, which we write as – – or – 2.

For example, consider this situation: I have `10 with me and my sister has `6.

For subtraction of positive and negative numbers, we will use this meaning of subtraction as ‘making equal’ or ‘finding the missing number to be added’. \u0007Evaluate 15 – 5, 100 – 10 and 74 – 34 from this perspective. In general, when there are two unequal quantities, subtraction can indicate the change needed to make the quantities equal.

In the context of different floor levels, what is the change required to reach the Target Floor from the Starting Floor? Notice that the change needed may be positive (for an increase) or negative (for a decrease). Teacher’s Note Your starting floor is the Art Centre and your target floor is the Sports Centre.

Adding, subtracting, and comparing any numbers To add and subtract even larger integers, we can imagine even larger lifts! In fact, we can imagine a lift that can extend forever upwards and forever downwards, starting from Level 0. There does not even have to be any building or mine around — just an ‘infinite lift’! We can use this imagination to add and subtract any integers we like. For example, suppose we want to carry out the subtraction + 2000 – (– 200). We can imagine a lift with 2000 levels above the ground and 200 below the ground. Recall that, Target Level – Starting Level = Movement needed To go from the Starting Floor – 200 to the Target Floor + 2000, we must press + 2200 (+ 200 to get to zero, and then + 2000 more after that to get to + 2200).

In the other exercises that you did above, did you notice that subtracting a negative number was the same as adding the corresponding positive number? Take a look at the ‘infinite lift’ above. Does it remind you of a number line? In what ways? Back to the number line The ‘infinite lift’ we saw above looked very much like a number line, didn’t it? In fact, if we rotate it by 90°, it basically becomes a number line. It also tells us how to complete the number ray to a number line, answering the question that we had asked at the beginning of the chapter.

Other numbers are not marked. It can be convenient to use this unmarked number line to add and subtract integers. You can show, or simply imagine, the scale of the number line and the positions of numbers on it.

Similarly, each time he presses the ‘–’ button, he takes a negative token and puts it in his pocket. He starts on the ground floor (Floor 0) with an empty pocket. After one hour, he checks his pocket and finds 5 positive and 3 negative tokens. On which floor is he now? He must have pressed ‘+’ five times and ‘–’ 3 times and (+ 5)+(– 3)= + 2. So, he is at Floor + 2 now. Here is another way to do the calculation. A positive token and a negative token cancel each other, because the value of this pair of tokens together is zero. These two tokens in his pocket meant that he pressed ‘+’ once and ‘–’ once, respectively, and these cancel each other. We say that a positive and a negative token make a ʻzero pairʼ. When you remove all the zero pairs, you are left with two positive tokens, so (+5) + (–3) = +2. We can perform any such addition using tokens! Example: Add + 5 and – 8. Reprint 2025-26"}

The concept of credit and debit was written about extensively by Kautilya in his Arthaśhāstra (c. 300 BCE), including the recognition that an account balance could be negative. The explicit use of negative numbers in the context of accounting is seen in a number of ancient Indian works, including in the Bakśhālī manuscript from around the year 300 CE, where a negative number was written using a special symbol placed after the number (rather than before the number as we do today). The first general treatment of positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero — all on an equal footing as equally-valid numbers on which one can perform the basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and even division — was given by Brahmagupta in his Brāhma-sphuṭa-siddhānta in the year 628 CE. Brahmagupta gave clear and explicit rules for operations on all numbers — positive, negative, and zero — that essentially formed the modern way of understanding these numbers that we still use today! Some of Brahmagupta’s key rules for addition and subtraction of positive numbers, negative numbers and zero are given below: Brahmagupta’s Rules for Addition (Brāhma-sphuṭa-siddhānta 18.30, 628 CE) 1. The sum of two positives is positive (e.g., 2 + 3 = 5). 2. The sum of two negatives is negative. To add two negatives, add the numbers (without the signs), and then place a minus sign to obtain the result (e.g., (– 2) + (– 3) = – 5). 3. To add a positive number and a negative number, subtract the smaller number (without the sign) from the greater number (without the sign), and place the sign of the greater number to obtain the result (e.g., – 5 + 3 = – 2, 2 + (– 3) = – 1 and – 3 + 5 = 2). 4. The sum of a number and its inverse is zero (e.g., 2 + (– 2) = 0). 5. The sum of any number and zero is the same number (e.g., – 2 + 0 = – 2 and 0 + 0 = 0). Reprint 2025-26"}

If a smaller positive is subtracted from a larger positive, the result is positive (e.g., 3 – 2 = 1). 2. If a larger positive is subtracted from a smaller positive, the result is negative (e.g., 2– 3 = – 1). 3. Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding the corresponding positive number (e.g., 2 – (– 3) = 2 + 3). 4. Subtracting a number from itself gives zero (e.g., 2 – 2 = 0 and – 2 – (– 2) = 0). 5. Subtracting zero from a number gives the same number (e.g., – 2 – 0 = – 2 and 0 – 0 = 0). Subtracting a number from zero gives the number’s inverse (e.g., 0 – (– 2) = 2).

It would change the way the world does mathematics. However, it took many centuries for the rest of the world to adopt zero and negative numbers as numbers. These numbers were transmitted to, accepted by, and further studied by the Arab world by the 9th century, before making their way to Europe by the 13th century. Reprint 2025-26"}

Lazare Carnot, a French mathematician in the 18th century, called negative numbers ‘absurd’. But over time, zero as well as negative numbers proved to be indispensable in global mathematics and science, and are now considered to be critical numbers on an equal footing with and as important as positive numbers — just as Brahmagupta had recommended and explicitly described way back in the year 628 CE! This abstraction of arithmetic rules on all numbers paved the way for the modern development of algebra, which we will learn about in future classes. Su m m a r y There are numbers that are less than zero. They are written with a ‘–’ sign in front of them (e.g., – 2), and are called negative numbers. They lie to the left of zero on the number line. The numbers ..., – 4, – 3, – 2, – 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... are called integers. The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, ... are called positive integers and the numbers …, – 4, – 3, – 2, – 1 are called negative integers. Zero (0) is neither positive nor negative. Every given number has another number associated to it which when added to the given number gives zero. This is called the additive inverse of the number. For example, the additive inverse of 7 is – 7 and the additive inverse of – 543 is 543. Addition can be interpreted as Starting Position + Movement = Target Position. Addition can also be interpreted as the combination of movements or increases/decreases: Movement 1 + Movement 2 = Total Movement. Subtraction can be interpreted as Target Position – Starting Position = Movement. Reprint 2025-26"}
