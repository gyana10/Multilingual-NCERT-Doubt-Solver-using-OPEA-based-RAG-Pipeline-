{"class": "class 5", "subject": "social studies class 5", "page_no": 3, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "The foundational stage in school education, as envisaged by the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, serves as the cornerstone for the holistic development of children. It enables students not only to imbibe the invaluable samskaras rooted in our country’s ethos and constitutional framework, but also to acquire basic literacy and numeracy. This foundation equips them to transition seamlessly into a more challenging preparatory stage. The preparatory stage acts as a bridge between the foundational and the middle stages, spanning three years from Grades 3 to 5. The education provided during this stage builds upon the pedagogical approaches of the foundational stage. While the play-way, discovery, and the activity-based learning methods continue, students are also introduced to textbooks and formal classroom settings. This introduction aims to establish a foundation across curricular areas, promoting holistic learning and self-exploration through reading, writing, speaking, thinking, drawing, singing, and playing. This comprehensive approach encompasses physical education, art education, environmental education, languages, mathematics, basic science and social sciences, ensuring that students are well-prepared both at the cognitive-sensitive and physical-emotional levels to effortlessly transition to the middle stage. Adhering to the recommendations of the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023, brought out, as a follow-up to the NEP 2020, a new subject area called ‘The World Around Us’ at the preparatory stage is introduced. This subject aims to provide environmental education through an experiential learning approach, connecting students’ experiences with the basic concepts of different subject areas, which they will study at the middle stage. Our Wondrous World, the textbook for The World Around Us, has been designed to help students connect their day-to-day learning about their world to the basic concepts of various subject areas — science, social sciences and environmental education. It aims to enhance their sensitivity towards their environment, develop skills to work with the community, and foster a positive attitude towards various professions. Our Wondrous World emphasises conceptual understanding, critical thinking, creativity, and the values and dispositions essential for this developmental stage. It incorporates cross-cutting themes such as inclusion, multilingualism, gender equality, and cultural rootedness, integrating appropriate ICT tools and school-based assessments. Foreword"}
{"class": "class 5", "subject": "social studies class 5", "page_no": 4, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "iv In Grades 3 and 4, students were familiarised with units — Our Communities, Life Around Us, Health and Well-being, Things Around Us and Our Environment. Grade 5 being the final year of the preparatory stage enables students for the middle stage in a complimentary way. It lays a sound foundation for students in science and social science, so that they are ready to learn these subjects separately from middle stage. The Grade 5 students are familiarised with vibrant India, important role of water through the example of river Godavari, health and well-being at home and school, what and how of different things around the students, and the environment on and around the planet Earth. Content and processes have been designed by keeping in view the age, experiences, interests and diversity of students everywhere. This textbook also carries a wide range of interesting facts about India’s traditions, culture and achievements. Student’s innate curiosity at this stage needs to be nurtured by addressing their questions and designing activities based on the core learning principles. While the play-way method continues, the nature of toys and games used for teaching evolves to enhance the engagement rather than mere attraction. While this textbook is valuable, students also need to explore additional resources on the subject. School libraries should facilitate this extended learning, and parents and teachers should support their endeavours. An effective learning environment motivates students, keeps them engaged and fosters curiosity and wonder — vital for learning. I recommend this textbook with confidence to all students and teachers at the preparatory stage. I extend my gratitude to everyone involved in its development, hopeful that it will meet the expectations. As NCERT remains committed to systemic reforms and improving the publication quality, we welcome feedback to refine the textbook content. \b Dinesh Prasad Saklani \b Director New Delhi\b National Council of Educational 28 June 2025\b Research and Training"}

As described in NCF-SE 2023, it aims to address the natural curiosity of students and help them gain a more systematic understanding of the natural, physical and social environment in their immediate context. Guided by the policy and the curriculum framework, the TWAU textbook is designed as a learning companion that encourages observation, questioning, investigation, reflection, and expression among students. It integrates science, social science, environmental studies, and foundational and vocational skills into one cohesive narrative, promoting interdisciplinary thinking and action. Through this approach, students begin to recognise patterns, processes and relationships between people and nature, cause and consequence, tradition and change. The Grade 5 textbook of TWAU, Our Wondrous World, continues the journey from the foundations laid in Grades 3 and 4. As students progress into the final year of the preparatory stage, this book reinforces experiences of exploration, experiments, play and discovery by guiding learners toward more structured, yet interactive learning. The textbook embodies the core principles of experiential learning through nature walks, observations, interviews, model-making, experiments and surveys. Students are encouraged to apply the basics of the scientific methods — to observe, hypothesise, test and conclude. In doing so, they also develop environmental awareness, ethical reasoning, empathy and a sense of responsibility towards others, and the planet. With the vision of developing cognitive, emotional, and physical capacities through holistic and integrated learning, this textbook adopts a student-centric, activity-rich and inquiry-driven pedagogy. It also supports a gradual progression from immediate surroundings to broader contexts. This structured exploration of the environment is assumed to develop the competencies identified for preparatory stage through TWAU based on the curricular goals identified in NCF-SE 2023. While designing and developing the content and activities, effort has been made for providing students with varied experiences of exploring environment, which helps students to understand the interdependence in the world and develop sensitivity towards environmental, and social issues. Throughout the book, inputs have been given for students to recognise the importance of About the Textbook"}

Collection of data and their analysis through observation, experiments and social survey would surely provide seeds of skills of questioning, and arriving at probable solutions. The book also tries to provide basic understanding of the concepts that would be discussed in different disciplines at middle stage. In addition, the book provides experience of map reading and interpretation as tools of exploring the world. The Indian Knowledge System (IKS) is organically integrated, offering students a lens to value indigenous practices, local crafts, folklore, and the wisdom of communities. Language, mathematics, and arts are also naturally embedded through cross-disciplinary activities. Designed with inclusivity and diversity at its heart, this book provides unique experiences for learners of different abilities and backgrounds. It encourages collaborative learning, respects multilingual contexts, and fosters the values of care, cooperation and democratic citizenship. The textbook has 10 chapters, structured into five thoughtfully curated units — Life Around Us, Health and Well-being, Incredible India, Things Around Us and Our Amazing Planet. The book provides opportunities for students to engage with real-life issues, local knowledge systems, and diverse cultures spread across our nation. Each unit has briefly outlined the desired competencies and the concepts covered. It is attempted to follow different approaches in each chapter. In the form of a narrative, Chapter 1: ‘Water — The Essence of Life’ emphasises how we need to be responsible and why it is important to maintain the balance in nature. This is followed by Chapter 2: ‘Journey of a River’ which is written in the form of an autobiography of the river Godavari to show how environmental, social and economic aspects are interconnected. Chapter 3: ‘The Mystery of Food’ uses an exploratory style, emphasising looking at things in the world around us that we do not see with the naked eye, for example, the discussion on microbes. Chapter 4: ‘Our School — A Happy Place’ is based on research, planning and action. Chapter 5: ‘Our Vibrant Country’ is about learning through things that are around us that we have not noticed or examined like the currency notes. Chapter 6: ‘Some Unique Places’ is a travelogue about discovering unique places in India, while Chapters 7 and 8 use activities and experiments to engage students. Chapter 7: ‘Energy — How Things Work’ and Chapter 8: ‘Clothes — How Things are Made’ are extension of the themes — how things work and how things are made as discussed in Grades 3 and 4. Chapter 9: ‘Rhythms of Nature’ gets students to note observations in the journal provided at the back of the book. Looking at things from historical perspectives"}

In the chapter, we are also highlighting the connections between what we do and the environment around us. In brief, the students are exposed to the world around us, how it is made, where things come from, what is their history, how we could be vulnerable and how we can act responsibly by understanding how the world around us is interconnected and how our ancient Indian philosophy of treating the world as one family, ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’, is important for sustainability. This book provides scope for students to record their observations in four quarters of the year in ‘Seasons’ Journal’ at the end. Teachers would guide students for doing so. Assessment is integrated into the learning process through reflective exercises, projects, group work, and creative expressions. ‘Let us reflect’ sections promote self-assessment and metacognition in alignment with the competencies given in the NCF-SE. Questions are placed in the book to promote critical thinking. The teacher needs to be more of a facilitator than someone who has all the answers. The teacher is encouraged to vary and extend the activities in the book as well as to initiate discussion in the classroom. The intention is to encourage the spirit of inquiry and openness to questions that may seem outside the curriculum. Some of these may deserve a discussion, if not an answer. ‘Notes to the Teacher’ offers guidance on facilitating rich classroom discussions and adapting content to local contexts. It is also important that teachers use adequate learning teaching materials such as maps and globes as without these, the designed activities would be incomplete and there is fear of achieving the competencies. Ultimately, Our Wondrous World aims to kindle a lifelong curiosity and joy in learning, enabling students to see their lives as part of a larger, interconnected world. It serves as a bridge between lived experiences and abstract ideas, between the local and the global, and between learning and living. The book has been designed as an exciting tool for the hands of the teacher and the student. The book aims to inculcate a sense of pride in India’s rich diversity, which is our strength. We hope that this textbook will provide a strong foundation for developing a wide range of competencies in students in the years ahead. \b Dhanya Krishnan \b Associate Professor and Member Coordinator \b Department of Elementary Education \b National Council of Educational \b Research and Training, New Delhi"}

Inspire them to explore where the water comes from and where it goes. • The Activity 6 in Chapter 1 on mustard seed shows how rivers flow from higher to lower ground and follow the shape of the land. Use the map of India to explore which rivers flow into which seas and how landforms (like mountains) guide their direction. • Talk about what happens to rainwater in their school or neighbourhood. Use this to start a conversation on how cities and villages plan for water. • Help students list different ways in which water plays an important role in our life. Connect this to ideas of sharing and saving water. Let them think about how water is stored in their homes (tanks, pots, etc.) and how a dam works as a big water storing unit. • Engage students in role-plays to critically think about both the scarcity and excess of water. • Encourage students to discuss with their parents or grandparents about festivals, stories, or memories connected to rivers. This will help them see rivers not just as physical things, but as part of their community and culture. Note to the Teacher This unit includes two chapters: Chapter 1 ‘Water — The Essence of Life’ and Chapter 2 ‘Journey of a River’. Following are the key concepts covered in these chapters. Chapter 1: Water — The Essence of Life • ‘Water — The Essence of Life’ introduces students to its various forms and different sources (freshwater and saltwater) of water. It also highlights the importance of water in different activities in the society. This chapter introduces the continuous movement of water in different forms through the water cycle. It also explores how water shapes the land and supports life in freshwater habitats, and highlights the need to conserve water. Chapter 2: Journey of a River • This chapter follows the story of the river Godavari from its origin to its delta. Through maps, stories and illustrations, it explores the tributaries of Godavari and aquatic life in the river. It familiarises students with the dams built on the river. Students learn how the river gets polluted. This chapter highlights the ways rivers support ecosystems, people and culture. After reading this chapter students will understand that water is a limited and shared resource which must be used wisely."}

Similarly in nature, heat causes water from different sources, like oceans and rivers, to become water vapour. Water vapour forms the clouds, which come down as rain, snow and hail. This water goes back into rivers, lakes and oceans. This constant circular movement of water in nature is called the water cycle.

Does this mean everyone could do whatever they want?”, asked Priya. “Imagine what would happen if there were no rules”, said the teacher. “In the same way, a country also needs rules to run smoothly, and keep everyone safe and happy. So, we made a plan and a set of rules for our country. On 26 January 1950, we decided to follow this special book of rules called the Constitution. This is why, we celebrate 26 January as India’s Republic Day every year”. Write 1. What events take place at your school on the Independence Day?

Note to the Teacher The unit consists of two chapters: Chapter 7 ‘Energy — How Things Work’ and Chapter 8 ‘Clothes — How Things are Made’. Chapter 7: Energy — How Things Work • ‘Energy — How Things Work’ introduces students to the concept of energy by connecting it with everyday experiences. They learn about the different forms of energy used at home and society. Through hands-on activities and examples, students explore how energy makes things work, and the importance of using clean and efficient energy. The simple hands-on activities enable students to play and learn about energy, and its possible uses. Chapter 8: Clothes — How Things are Made • ‘Clothes — How Things are Made’ explores how cloth is made; starting from natural patterns like birds weaving nests, to human methods of spinning, weaving and stitching. Through hands-on activities and stories from across India, students learn how threads become fabric, discover local traditions like handloom and embroidery, and understand the value of reuse, recycling and creativity in everyday materials."}

Use journals and charts to help them track and reflect on these observation. • Take students outside the classroom to the school ground, garden, or nearby pond, to explore real-life patterns in nature. • Ask simple critical thinking questions like, “Where did this come from?” or “Why do we all use it?” to spark curiosity. • Use mapping, drawing, posters, and globe-based activities to help students trace how things travel across the Earth. • Compare seasonal experiences from different parts of India (for example, winter in Kashmir vs. Kerala) to deepen their understanding of local diversity. • Help students see that we all share the same Earth and are part of one big family — ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’. Note to the Teacher This unit consists of two chapters. Chapter 9 ‘Rhythms of Nature’ and Chapter 10 ‘Earth: Our Shared Home’. Chapter 9: Rhythms of Nature • ‘Rhythms of Nature’ helps students observe and understand the natural rhythms of change in the world around them — day and night, seasons, and how plants, animals, people and places transform over time. Through journaling, activities and reflection, it encourages students to connect deeply with their local environment and notice repeating patterns in nature. Chapter 10: Earth — Our Shared Home • This chapter helps students see the Earth as a connected, living planet where people, animals, plants, and ideas travel, mix and grow together. Through stories, it shows how we share nature, knowledge, and culture across borders. It brings alive the idea of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ fostering care, respect, and a sense of belonging to our shared planet."}

The side where the light falls has day, and the side with no light has night. Step 2: Rotation — Slowly rotate the globe while keeping the torch steady.

You now know that nature changes slowly over the year. The weather warms up, gets hot and then it rains, and then it gets cooler before warming up again. We observed these changes throughout the year, but do you think the same things happened last year too? Will they happen again the next year? Yes! These changes follow a pattern, a natural rhythm that repeats itself every year. This repeating pattern in nature is what we call seasons. What are the seasons called in your region?
