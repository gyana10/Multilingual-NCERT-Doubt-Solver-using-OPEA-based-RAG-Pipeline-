{"class": "class 5", "subject": "english class 5", "page_no": 3, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "Foreword The Foundational Stage in school education, as envisaged by the National Education Policy 2020, serves as the cornerstone for the holistic development of children. It enables them not only to imbibe the invaluable samskaras rooted in our country’s ethos and constitutional framework, but also to acquire basic literacy and numeracy. This foundation equips them to transition seamlessly into the more challenging Preparatory Stage. The Preparatory Stage acts as a bridge between the Foundational and the Middle Stages, spanning three years from Grade 3 to Grade 5. The education provided during this stage builds upon the pedagogical approaches of the Foundational Stage. While the play-way, discovery, and activity-based learning methods continue, children are also introduced to textbooks and more formal classroom settings. This introduction aims to not overwhelm but establish a foundation across curricular areas, promoting holistic learning and self-exploration through reading, writing, speaking, drawing, singing, and playing. This comprehensive approach encompasses physical education, art education, environmental education, languages, mathematics, basic science, and social science. This comprehensive approach ensures children are well-prepared both at the cognitive-sensitive and physical-pranic (emotional) levels to effortlessly transition to the Middle Stage. Santoor, the textbook for Grade 5, is meticulously designed to align with these objectives. It adheres to the recommendations of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023. The textbook emphasises conceptual understanding, critical thinking, creativity, values and dispositions essential for this developmental stage. It incorporates cross-cutting themes, such as inclusion, multilingualism, gender equality, and cultural rootedness integrating appropriate ICT and school-based assessments. The engaging content and activities are designed to captivate students and encourage peer group learning, thus enriching the educational experience for students as well as teachers."}
{"class": "class 5", "subject": "english class 5", "page_no": 4, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "iv It is crucial to remember the pedagogical focus of the textbook emphasising understanding, critical thinking, reasoning, and decision making. Children’s innate curiosity at this stage should be nurtured by addressing their questions and designing activities based on core learning principles. Though the play-way method continues, the nature of toys and games used for teaching evolves to enhance engagement rather than mere attraction. While this textbook is valuable, children should also explore additional resources on the subject. School libraries should facilitate this extended learning, and parents and teachers should support their endeavours. An effective learning environment motivates students, keeping them engaged and fostering curiosity and wonder vital for learning. With confidence, I recommend this textbook to all students and teachers at the Preparatory Stage. I extend my gratitude to everyone involved in its development, hopeful that it will meet expectations. As NCERT remains committed to systemic reforms and improving publication quality, we welcome feedback to refine the textbook content.

{"class": "class 5", "subject": "english class 5", "page_no": 5, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "Language lies at the centre of human cognitive, social, and cultural experiences. It enables effective communication, which is integral to the formation and functioning of societies and cultures (NCF-SE, p. 234). The present textbook is designed in alignment with the visionary framework of the NEP 2020 and the NCF-SE 2023. In the preparatory stage, students develop proficiency in speaking and competencies in reading and writing in both languages — Reading in Language 1 (R1) and Reading in Language 2 (R2). While students achieve these faster in R1, they are expected to gain familiarity with R2, gradually progressing from basic communication skills to greater fluency and proficiency in speaking and writing. To take children well beyond foundational literacy and develop a genuine interest in independent reading, the textbook draws from children’s real-life experiences and reflects their cultural and social milieu. It is purposefully crafted to meet specific stage competencies and grade-based learning outcomes, ensuring alignment with core principles of the subject. It uses language appropriate for the grade level and provides support for unfamiliar vocabulary and complex sentence structures. It incorporates digital elements and external references suitably within the material. Local context heavily influences content selection. The textbook aims to be engaging, striking a balance between visuals and text, leaning towards visually appealing material making it suitable for easy comprehension by young learners. To foster oral skills, this textbook offers engaging learning materials that encourage students to converse with each other. The content features a range of activities, such as reciting rhymes, singing songs, role-playing, etc., facilitating in-class practice. To enhance reading abilities, the textbook presents a diverse array of content, encompassing stories, poems, narratives and a comic strip. It maintains a balance between familiar and unfamiliar texts and contexts. With large font sizes, colourful illustrations, and captivating chapter titles, it captivates student interest. The text stimulates critical thinking and sparks imagination, fostering curiosity. The content is structured to aid students in transitioning from guided to independent reading. For honing writing skills, the selected content systematically imparts writing proficiency. Students About the Book"}
{"class": "class 5", "subject": "english class 5", "page_no": 6, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "vi engage in activities that encourage independent practice, such as constructing simple sentences, encouraging creative expression and skill development in writing. All these are done through various sections, like ‘Let us Recite’, ‘Let us Think’, ‘Let us Speak’, ‘Let us Learn’, ‘Let us Listen’, and ‘Let us Write’, ‘Let us Do’, and ‘Let us Explore’. This not only helps the learner in the process of language acquisition but also builds up their confidence level. Curricular Goals (CGs) lay the foundation of every learning-teaching material. In line with the textbooks for Grades 1 and 2, Santoor (Grade 3) has been developed after careful consideration of the curricular goals. The curricular goals for language address the diverse needs of learners in a language classroom. Communication and comprehension are at the heart of every language and the same has been reiterated through CG1: Sustains effective communication skills for day-to-day interactions, enhancing their oral ability to express ideas. The book provides ample opportunities for learners to engage with the text and share their input. Sections titled ‘Let us Speak’ and ‘Think and Discuss’ subsection of ‘Let us Think’ present opportunities for students to be creative with replies and share with classmates allowing them to engage with language in a meaningful way. Similarly, CG 4: Develops a wide range of vocabulary in various contexts and through different sources has been addressed by incorporation of texts and activities that are not limited only to literature but also encompass content areas like mathematics and ‘The World Around Us’ activities and vocabulary pertaining to the same find a place in different units. For example, Unit 1 has activities related to shapes whereas, Unit 4 provides scope for students and teachers to discuss ordinal numbers. In Grades 3 and 4, although guided writing is the main component, there is a gradual progress towards making learners independent writers. This is in alignment with the CG 3 that develops the ability to express their understanding, experiences, feelings, and ideas in writing. Reading as a process is not limited to decoding, says CG 2 which aims to develop fluency in reading and the ability to read with comprehension. The activities in Santoor are designed to evoke responses by the students’ reflecting their understanding of the text through the ‘Answer the following’ subsection."}
{"class": "class 5", "subject": "english class 5", "page_no": 7, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "vii One of the major recommendations of NCF-SE 2023 is the inclusion of knowledge of India. Indian values and traditions have been presented to the learner in an easily comprehensible way. The theme of Unit 1 is ‘Let’s Have Fun’. This unit introduces the child with the magic of humour. Humour can transform the classroom into a space where creativity, confidence, and critical thinking thrive. The unit comprises a humorous and heartwarming poem ‘Papa’s Spectacles’ and a story ‘Gone with the Scooter’. In the poem the father is looking for his spectacles everywhere in the house and when it is found at an obvious place, resulting in laughter. Similarly, in the story, a boy and his friends are playing with a hockey ball when suddenly things take an unexpected turn. The theme for Unit 2 is ‘My Colourful World’, and it comprises of a poem ‘ The Rainbow’ and a story ‘ The Wise Parrot’. Both the chapters are inspiring, and encourage learners to respect nature and freedom. Through a short poem titled ‘ The Rainbow’, students are introduced to the concept of things created by humans and things created by mother nature. The story ‘ The Wise Parrot’ helps the learners understand the value of freedom and to use it responsibly. Unit 3, titled ‘Water’, attempts to expose children to the world of water— underwater life and aquatic organisms, and the importance of saving water. The unit begins with an engaging poem, ‘The Frog’ that talks about a playful frog, and aims to develop an appreciation of nature. The unit also includes a chapter, ‘What a Tank’, that describes different traditional and artistic water tanks found in rural areas of Punjab. The chapter emphasises the judicious use of water. The theme for Unit 4 is ‘Ups and Downs’. It includes successes and failures, joys and sorrows, and life‘s ups and downs. Under this theme, a poem ‘Gilli Danda’ and a story ‘ The Decision of the Panchayat’ have been incorporated in the book. The poem showcases the joys of childhood, and inspires teamwork. Through the story ‘ The Decision of the Panchayat’ the students are introduced to the importance of presence of mind, problem-solving, and truthfulness. Both the chapters intend to prepare the learners to adapt to the changing environment, navigate complex situations, and achieve their goals effectively. Unit 5, ‘Work is Worship’, introduces children to the world of work. The unit contains a poem ‘Vocation’ allowing the readers to look into the world from the lens of a child. The chapter ‘Glass"}
{"class": "class 5", "subject": "english class 5", "page_no": 8, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "viii Bangles’ emphasises the importance of crafts and skills. The chapter depicts a wonderful bond and teamwork between a father and his daughter. The unit endorses the idea that no work is superior or inferior. Throughout the textbook, language and literacy, physical, socio-emotional, aesthetic, and cognitive domains have been integrated along with the development of positive habits to create a learning impression in totality for children. Development of Annamaya, Pranamaya, Manomaya, and Vijnanmaya kosha is an ongoing process which leads to the manifestation of Anandmaya kosha. The present textbook is a step in this direction. In addition to the material provided in the textbook, teachers may also use the matter embedded in the QR code. Further, as suggested in ‘Note to the Teacher’ section given throughout the book, teachers are encouraged to use local stories, proverbs and objects in the classroom, as well as audio and video support from DIKSHA platform. The textbook is only one tool, learning needs many resources. Children also absorb a wealth of knowledge by observing their surroundings, interacting with peers and elders like grandparents, engaging in hands-on activities, watching TV, using mobile devices, playing with toys and games, listening to stories and poems, working on projects, visiting culturally significant places, and travelling. It is crucial to appreciate and align this diverse learning with the competencies and curricular goals set for this stage. Educating our children is a shared responsibility that extends beyond formal textbooks. Varada Mohan Nikalje Professor and Member-Coordinator Department of Elementary Education, NCERT, New Delhi"}

Gopi was sitting in the veranda, reading a book. Suddenly, he heard something rustling past and falling with a thud in the garden. He wondered what it could be. Perhaps, it was a mango falling from the tree. Immediately, Gopi put his book aside, got up, and ran into the garden. He searched in between the thick grass near the garden fence. But, he found nothing. He looked among the bushes. Nothing was there again. Then, his eyes fell on a heap of dry leaves. There was a white ball on the heap. Gopi reached out and took the ball in his hands. It was a hockey ball."}

He lay down on the mat, and said to himself, “I can’t keep this ball for myself. I will ask around.” In the evening, Gopi went to the nearby playground where all his friends regularly gathered to play hockey. “Friends, this afternoon I found a ball. Did any of you lose your ball recently?” Manoj said, “I lost a ball four months ago.” Gopi said, “So, the ball that I found cannot be yours.” Ramani said, “Then the ball is mine.”"}

If so, the goat is considered ‘captured’ and will be out of the board. • In order to prevent the tiger from jumping over the goat, the next intersection has to be covered. So the goat player places another pebble at that intersection. • The goat player places one goat on the board at a time. The tiger player can either place the tiger stone or move. • But, the goats cannot move until all thirteen of them are on the board. The tigers must attempt to ‘capture’ the goats by jumping over them into a free space, the goat is then taken off the board."}

He lived a simple life, wearing plain clothes and eating very little, but his smile and loving words made everyone feel special. One day, a curious young boy named Naren came to meet him. Ramakrishna saw something special in Naren and became his teacher. He taught Naren about courage, kindness, and how to find peace within. Naren later grew up to become the famous Swami Vivekananda, spreading his teacher’s wisdom to the world. Even today, Ramakrishna’s teachings inspire many people everywhere. 1.
