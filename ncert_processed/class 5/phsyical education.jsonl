It enables them not only to imbibe the invaluable samskaras rooted in our country’s ethos and constitutional framework, but also to acquire basic literacy and numeracy. This foundation equips them to transition seamlessly into the more challenging Preparatory Stage. The Preparatory Stage acts as a bridge between the Foundational and the Middle stages, spanning three years from Grades 3 – 5. The education provided during this stage builds upon the pedagogical approaches of the Foundational Stage. While the play-way and discovery, plus the activity-based learning methods continue, children are also introduced to textbooks and formal classroom settings. This introduction aims not to overwhelm but to establish a foundation across curricular areas, promoting holistic learning and self-exploration through reading, writing, speaking, drawing, singing, and playing. This comprehensive approach encompasses physical education, art education, environmental education, languages, mathematics, basic science, and social science. This comprehensive approach ensures children are well-prepared both at the cognitive-sensitive and physical-pranic (emotional) levels to effortlessly transition to the Middle Stage. Adhering to the recommendations of the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), brought out as a follow-up to the NEP 2020, a new subject area called “Physical Education and Well-being” has been introduced at the Preparatory Stage. This subject aims to promote a love for physical activity and sports; develop capacities for skillful engagement in physical activity and sports; and develop resilience, empathy, and cooperation. India has a wonderful tradition of Yoga which is a wholesome experience for maintaining mind and body wellness. Physical Education and Well-being includes various aspects of Yoga starting from Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama and Dhyana in a progressive way from Grade 3 till the Secondary Stage. This lays the foundation for holistic health and well-being."}
{"class": "class 5", "subject": "phsyical education", "page_no": 4, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "iv The book for Physical Education and Well-being, titled Khel Yoga for Grade 4, is meticulously designed to develop basic motor skills and engage children in local traditional games to have fun while playing and getting connected with our culture. Age-specific aspects of Yoga are designed to lay the foundation for healthy living. The textbook aligns with the competencies included in the NCF-SE 2023 for this stage. Khel Yoga for Grade 5 is in progression of Grade 4 textbook of physical education and well-being which emphasises the importance of physical activity and the values and dispositions essential for life. It incorporates cross-cutting themes, such as inclusion, gender equality, and cultural rootedness. The content and activities are designed to encourage peer group learning, and enrich the educational experience for students, teachers and community. While this textbook is valuable, students should also explore interesting local games and play with friends. This book is not only useful for school learning, but is a valuable resource for parents and community. While the play-way method continues, the nature of toys and games used for teaching evolves to enhance engagement rather than mere attraction. While this textbook is valuable, children should also explore additional resources on the subject. School libraries should facilitate this extended learning, and parents and teachers should support their endeavours. An effective learning environment motivates students, keeping them engaged and fostering curiosity and wonder vital for learning. With confidence, I recommend this textbook to all students and teachers at the Preparatory Stage. I extend my gratitude to everyone involved in its development, hopeful that it will meet expectations. As NCERT remains committed to systemic reforms and improving publication quality, we welcome feedback to refine the textbook content. \b Dinesh Prasad Saklani \b Director New Delhi\b National Council of Educational 31 March 2025 \b Research and Training"}

Physical activity is integral to human life and, therefore, integral to the school curriculum. For an individual student, sports and physical activities teach important motor skills, practices of physical fitness, socio- emotional awareness and regulation, associated cognitive abilities, as well as the values of self-discipline, hard work, teamwork, and a gracious acceptance of one’s strengths and vulnerabilities. Since ages India has recognised the centrality of a healthy body and healthy mind as part of any educational experience. A very rich heritage of physical activities and games such as wrestling, malkhamb, kalaripayattu, thang-ta, gatka and archery along with the practice of Yoga emphasise these connections between body, health, well-being, and the holistic development of the human being. The National Curriculum Framework for School Education 2023 (NCF-SE 2023) recognises the criticality of the health and well-being of individuals as a key factor for success in all other aspects of life. Considering the focus on holistic well-being, NCF-SE 2023 has mandated Physical Education and Well-being as a core curricular area for all stages of school education. To help teachers and students achieve the curricular goals of physical education and well-being, for the first time, a textbook has been designed for Grade 5. This book enables students to experience the joy of playing, explore diverse physical activities, think and discuss, learn to play together, and treat each other with kindness. The book has three units: Basic Motor Movements, Our Games, and Yoga. In Unit 1—Basic Motor Movements, students will engage in movements like throwing, catching, running, jumping, kicking, receiving and hitting with the help of advanced apparatus. Objects of different sizes, weights and texture are used to facilitate these diverse types of movements. This unit is a continuation of the play-based"}

In Chapter 4 of Unit 1 ‘Little Steps’, certain activities such as cart wheel, crab wheel, etc. require teacher’s attention towards the performers to avoid injuries. Children generally love to play games. While playing, they interact with other children, discuss rules, strive to excel, help each other and enjoy being together. In our country, we have many local traditional games from different regions played by children and elders. NCERT had released books for Grades 3 and 4 earlier in which the students have enjoyed playing games and learned so many personality traits. Some new games are included in Unit 2 — Our Games. It has 12 traditional games from different parts of the country. Instructions for how to play each game and illustrations showing the details are given in the book. It is possible that some of these games might be played differently in your region; you may customise the rules. After the presentation of each game, suggestions for variations in the rules are given to make the game more interesting and to encourage children to play these games at home with their family, friends community and society. These games can be played during family ceremonies, outings, picnics, vanbhraman. Unit 3—Yoga encourages students to foster holistic well-being. At this age, children are by nature happy and joyful. Yoga is introduced through interesting activities in a playful way to develop healthy habits and learn preparatory practices required for performing various Yogic techniques in higher classes. Introduction to Ashtanga Yoga (eight aspects of Yoga), and details about the Yoga unit for Grade 5, are given in the section Information for Physical Education Teachers at the end of the book. The yogic asanas, kriyas, mudras, pranayamas, etc. can be performed by the parents, grandparents, community persons, etc. for ensuring their holistic well-being but before trying to perform yogic activities please ensure the fitness levels as ascertained by the experts. In this book, apart from learning games and physical activities, students will learn to follow rules, understand the importance of safe practices and fair play, work harmoniously in groups, treat each other with courtesy and respect as well as help each other, and experience the joy of playing together.

Sufficient time must be given for circle time during the physical education and well-being period. The aim of Circle time is to develop the above values and dispositions through Physical Education. After completion of the physical activity or game, all the students sit in a circle to share their experience during the activity. It is important to set some ground rules for circle time to ensure that all students get opportunities to express themselves. • Everyone in the circle is equal; no one is more important than the others. • Everybody should respect each other and their feelings. • No one must interrupt while another person is speaking. • Everyone in the circle must get the opportunity to speak, and others must pay attention to what they are saying. The teacher can guide the session by asking everyone to share their experience about the activity. Every student can share a star and a wish, and then ‘tag’ another student to share. The process continues till each student gets their turn. Some pertinent and thought provoking questions can be discussed during this session, like — Are we biased towards our friends when we play? Are we including everyone equally in a game? Are some people not having as much fun? Circle time can also involve engaging discussions related to the context of the game. For example, if someone is injured during the game, the teacher can choose to discuss ‘how to avoid injuries while playing’. Session Planning Physical education and well-being is allotted approximately 150 periods in the year. It is essential to plan these sessions effectively for the development of required competencies mentioned in NCF-SE 2023.

For balanced development of skills and values, different types of activities may be planned in each period. Three types of sessions are given below to maximise learning in the given time: Type 1 Game practice. Type 2 \u0007Circle time after play to provide sufficient time for thinking and discussing socio-emotional aspects. Type 3 \u0007Gamified drills to focus on one specific skill. The following may be considered while planning a session: • Warm-up and cool-down activities at the beginning and at the end of each session to avoid injuries and facilitate quick recovery from physical activity. • Demonstration and modelling to help students understand what is expected of them. • Planning the right levels of challenge for different groups of students. • Planning should be focussed on the learning outcomes that need to be achieved. For example, jumping and hopping can be done through animal movement games like Mai Bhi Maindhak, and catching and hitting can be done through a hit and cover or corner tennis. Physical Education is important for both physical and mental health and development. It helps improve a child’s muscular and cardiovascular strength, flexibility, endurance, motor skills, and mind-body connection and wellness. It gives students the opportunity to set and strive for personal and achievable goals. Moreover, playing sports also helps students develop the qualities of teamwork, cooperation, problem-solving, discipline, perseverance, and responsibility. In general, physical activity is well established to be among the best for relaxation and facilitates emotional stability and resilience. All these qualities and benefits are also relevant to success in the classroom; studies show that students who stay physically active are more successful with other school work as well. Finally, people who are physically active as young people tend to stay more fit as adults as well, leading them to lead longer, healthier, and more productive lives."}

Discuss why this is important. • Encourage students to be considerate of teammate’s skills while practising. For example, if they hit the ball too hard and their teammate is not able to handle it, they must reduce the force. • Encourage students to be careful while pushing or pulling an opponent when participating in an activity that requires this. • Encourage students to treat each other with kindness, focus on enjoying the game and not just on the outcome of the game. • Encourage students to collect all equipment after their use. • Ensure active participation of all students in all activities. • Allow children to explore different types of materials and objects to play with, such as different sizes of softballs and bats, tyres, small spades (blunted), or any kind of local toy or object.

In continuation to the basic motor movements that we learnt in Grades 3 and 4, we use our large muscles for movements such as jumping, throwing, catching, kicking, and hitting. These are known as gross motor skills, which play a vital role in everyday tasks, sports, and maintaining physical fitness. In contrast, fine motor skills involve the use of small muscles in our hands and fingers, which are helpful for more precise actions like writing, drawing, picking up small items, and gripping objects. Both gross and fine motor skills are essential components of basic motor development. There are five key motor movements that we emphasise: throwing, catching, kicking, receiving, and striking.

His mother smiled and said, “The answers you are looking for are kept in a special mystery box called Gyana Yoga.” She explained, “Every time you read, observe, ask questions, experiment, or listen carefully, you find a little key. Each key helps you open a part of the mystery box and discover an answer inside.

Kavya makes up her mind In Kavya’s class, there was a girl named Adya. One day, Adya came to school wearing a pretty butterfly hair clip. Kavya liked it very much. As Adya was leaving the class in the evening, the clip accidentally fell from her hair. She didn’t notice it. Kavya saw the clip on the floor and picked it up. At first, she wanted to give it back to Adya. But then, she changed her mind and quietly put it into her bag. On the bus ride home, she felt uneasy. “I should return it … but I like it so much,” she thought. “I have stolen her clip, that is wrong … No, I did not steal it, she dropped it … I could have told her … it is not my duty to tell her …"}

Why should I try to give away something that God has given me?” Kavya reached home but was very quiet. Her mother asked if something was wrong, but Kavya said she was fine. Later, her grandfather also asked if the teacher had scolded her. Kavya said no and tried to smile and act cheerful. The next day, Adya told the teacher she had lost her hair clip at school.

Step 1: Draw a small black dot of about 1 cm diameter at the centre of an A4-size sheet white paper. Step 2: Sit in Sukhasana and place the dot on a wall. The dot should be about 2 to 3 feet away at eye-level. Each child will have one dot to focus at. Step 3: Look at the dot without blinking for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Step 4: When the eyes feel a little watery, close them and try to visualise the dot in your mind. Step 5: After a few seconds, rub the two palms, generate sufficient heat and gently place them on the closed eyes for half a minute. Feel the warmth of the palms. This process is called palming which reduces the eye strain. Repeat the entire procedure 2 to 3 times along with palming. Note for the teacher Encourage the children to practise bindu trataka at home every day in the morning."}
