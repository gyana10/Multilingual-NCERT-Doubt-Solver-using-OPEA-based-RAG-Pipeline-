This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986). The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge. These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience. The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in Science and Mathematics, Professor J.V. Narlikar and the Chief Advisors for this book, Professor P.

Based on the understanding developed over the years, a National Curriculum Framework (NCF) was finalised in 2005. As part of this exercise, a National Focus Group on Teaching of Mathematics was formed. Its report, which came in 2005, highlighted a constructivist approach to the teaching and learning of mathematics. The essence of this approach is that children already know, and do some mathematics very naturally in their surroundings, before they even join school. The syllabus, teaching approach, textbooks etc., should build on this knowledge in a way that allows children to enjoy mathematics, and to realise that mathematics is more about a way of reasoning than about mechanically applying formulae and algorithms. The students and teachers need to perceive mathematics as something natural and linked to the world around us. While teaching mathematics, the focus should be on helping children to develop the ability to particularise and generalise, to solve and pose meaningful problems, to look for patterns and relationships, and to apply the logical thinking behind mathematical proof. And, all this in an environment that the children relate to, without overloading them. This is the philosophy with which the mathematics syllabus from Class I to Class XII was developed, and which the textbook development committee has tried to realise in the present textbook. More specifically, while creating the textbook, the following broad guidelines have been kept in mind. l The matter needs to be linked to what the child has studied before, and to her experiences. l The language used in the book, including that for ‘word problems’, must be clear, simple and unambiguous. l Concepts/processes should be introduced through situations from the children’s environment. l For each concept/process give several examples and exercises, but not of the same kind. This ensures that the children use the concept/process again and again, but in varying contexts. Here ‘several’ should be within reason, not overloading the child. l Encourage the children to see, and come out with, diverse solutions to problems. Reprint 2025-26"}
{"class": "class 10", "subject": "maths", "page_no": 8, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "l As far as possible, give the children motivation for results used. l All proofs need to be given in a non-didactic manner, allowing the learner to see the flow of reason. The focus should be on proofs where a short and clear argument reinforces mathematical thinking and reasoning. l Whenever possible, more than one proof is to be given. l Proofs and solutions need to be used as vehicles for helping the learner develop a clear and logical way of expressing her arguments. l All geometric constructions should be accompanied by an analysis of the construction and a proof for the steps taken to do the required construction. Accordingly, the children would be trained to do the same while doing constructions. l Add such small anecdotes, pictures, cartoons and historical remarks at several places which the children would find interesting. l Include optional exercises for the more interested learners. These would not be tested in the examinations. l Give answers to all exercises, and solutions/hints for those that the children may require. l Whenever possible, propagate constitutional values. As you will see while studying this textbook, these points have been kept in mind by the Textbook Development Committee. The book has particularly been created with the view to giving children space to explore mathematics and develop the abilities to reason mathematically. Further, two special appendices have been given — Proofs in Mathematics, and Mathematical Modelling. These are placed in the book for interested students to study, and are only optional reading at present. These topics may be considered for inclusion in the main syllabi in due course of time. As in the past, this textbook is also a team effort. However, what is unusual about the team this time is that teachers from different kinds of schools have been an integral part at each stage of the development. We are also assuming that teachers will contribute continuously to the process in the classroom by formulating examples and exercises contextually suited to the children in their particular classrooms. Finally, we hope that teachers and learners would send comments for improving the textbook to the NCERT. PARVIN SINCLAIR G.P.

We continue our discussion on real numbers in this chapter. We begin with very important properties of positive integers in Sections 1.2, namely the Euclid’s division algorithm and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Euclid’s division algorithm, as the name suggests, has to do with divisibility of integers. Stated simply, it says any positive integer a can be divided by another positive integer b in such a way that it leaves a remainder r that is smaller than b. Many of you probably recognise this as the usual long division process. Although this result is quite easy to state and understand, it has many applications related to the divisibility properties of integers. We touch upon a few of them, and use it mainly to compute the HCF of two positive integers. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, on the other hand, has to do something with multiplication of positive integers. You already know that every composite number can be expressed as a product of primes in a unique way—this important fact is the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Again, while it is a result that is easy to state and understand, it has some very deep and significant applications in the field of mathematics. We use the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic for two main applications. First, we use it to prove the irrationality of many of the numbers you studied in Class IX, such as 2, 3 and 5 . Second, we apply this theorem to explore when exactly the decimal expansion of a rational number, say ( 0) p q q  , is terminating and when it is non- terminating repeating. We do so by looking at the prime factorisation of the denominator q of p q . You will see that the prime factorisation of q will completely reveal the nature of the decimal expansion of p q . So let us begin our exploration. REAL NUMBERS Reprint 2025-26"}
{"class": "class 10", "subject": "maths", "page_no": 16, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "2 MATHEMATICS 1.2 The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic In your earlier classes, you have seen that any natural number can be written as a product of its prime factors. For instance, 2 = 2, 4 = 2 × 2, 253 = 11 × 23, and so on. Now, let us try and look at natural numbers from the other direction. That is, can any natural number be obtained by multiplying prime numbers? Let us see. Take any collection of prime numbers, say 2, 3, 7, 11 and 23. If we multiply some or all of these numbers, allowing them to repeat as many times as we wish, we can produce a large collection of positive integers (In fact, infinitely many). Let us list a few : 7 × 11 × 23 = 1771 3 × 7 × 11 × 23 = 5313 2 × 3 × 7 × 11 × 23 = 10626 23 × 3 × 73 = 8232 22 × 3 × 7 × 11 × 23 = 21252 and so on. Now, let us suppose your collection of primes includes all the possible primes. What is your guess about the size of this collection? Does it contain only a finite number of integers, or infinitely many? Infact, there are infinitely many primes. So, if we combine all these primes in all possible ways, we will get an infinite collection of numbers, all the primes and all possible products of primes. The question is – can we produce all the composite numbers this way? What do you think? Do you think that there may be a composite number which is not the product of powers of primes? Before we answer this, let us factorise positive integers, that is, do the opposite of what we have done so far. We are going to use the factor tree with which you are all familiar. Let us take some large number, say, 32760, and factorise it as shown. Reprint 2025-26"}
{"class": "class 10", "subject": "maths", "page_no": 17, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "REAL NUMBERS 3 Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777 – 1855) An equivalent version of Theorem 1.2 was probably first recorded as Proposition 14 of Book IX in Euclid’s Elements, before it came to be known as the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. However, the first correct proof was given by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. Carl Friedrich Gauss is often referred to as the ‘Prince of Mathematicians’ and is considered one of the three greatest mathematicians of all time, along with Archimedes and Newton. He has made fundamental contributions to both mathematics and science. So we have factorised 32760 as 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 13 as a product of primes, i.e., 32760 = 23 × 32 × 5 × 7 × 13 as a product of powers of primes. Let us try another number, say, 123456789. This can be written as 32 × 3803 × 3607. Of course, you have to check that 3803 and 3607 are primes! (Try it out for several other natural numbers yourself.) This leads us to a conjecture that every composite number can be written as the product of powers of primes. In fact, this statement is true, and is called the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic because of its basic crucial importance to the study of integers. Let us now formally state this theorem. Theorem 1.1 (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic) : Every composite number can be expressed (factorised) as a product of primes, and this factorisation is unique, apart from the order in which the prime factors occur. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic says that every composite number can be factorised as a product of primes. Actually it says more. It says that given any composite number it can be factorised as a product of prime numbers in a ‘unique’ way, except for the order in which the primes occur. That is, given any composite number there is one and only one way to write it as a product of primes, as long as we are not particular about the order in which the primes occur. So, for example, we regard 2 × 3 × 5 × 7 as the same as 3 × 5 × 7 × 2, or any other possible order in which these primes are written. This fact is also stated in the following form: The prime factorisation of a natural number is unique, except for the order of its factors. Reprint 2025-26"}
{"class": "class 10", "subject": "maths", "page_no": 18, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "4 MATHEMATICS In general, given a composite number x, we factorise it as x = p1p2 ... pn, where p1, p2,..., pn are primes and written in ascending order, i.e., p1  p2  . . .  pn. If we combine the same primes, we will get powers of primes. For example, 32760 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 13 = 23 × 32 × 5 × 7 × 13 Once we have decided that the order will be ascending, then the way the number is factorised, is unique. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic has many applications, both within mathematics and in other fields. Let us look at some examples. Example 1 : Consider the numbers 4n, where n is a natural number. Check whether there is any value of n for which 4n ends with the digit zero. Solution : If the number 4n, for any n, were to end with the digit zero, then it would be divisible by 5. That is, the prime factorisation of 4n would contain the prime 5. This is not possible because 4n = (2)2n; so the only prime in the factorisation of 4n is 2. So, the uniqueness of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic guarantees that there are no other primes in the factorisation of 4n. So, there is no natural number n for which 4n ends with the digit zero. You have already learnt how to find the HCF and LCM of two positive integers using the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic in earlier classes, without realising it! This method is also called the prime factorisation method. Let us recall this method through an example. Example 2 : Find the LCM and HCF of 6 and 20 by the prime factorisation method. Solution : We have : 6 = 21 × 31 and 20 = 2 × 2 × 5 = 22 × 51. You can find HCF(6, 20) = 2 and LCM(6, 20) = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 = 60, as done in your earlier classes. Note that HCF(6, 20) = 21 = Product of the smallest power of each common prime factor in the numbers. LCM (6, 20) = 22 × 31 × 51 = Product of the greatest power of each prime factor, involved in the numbers. From the example above, you might have noticed that HCF(6, 20) × LCM(6, 20) = 6 × 20. In fact, we can verify that for any two positive integers a and b, HCF (a, b) × LCM (a, b) = a × b. We can use this result to find the LCM of two positive integers, if we have already found the HCF of the two positive integers. Example 3: Find the HCF of 96 and 404 by the prime factorisation method. Hence, find their LCM. Reprint 2025-26"}

You studied about their existence and how the rationals and the irrationals together made up the real numbers. You even studied how to locate irrationals on the number line. However, we did not prove that they were irrationals. In this section, we will prove that 2 , 3 , 5 and, in general, p is irrational, where p is a prime. One of the theorems, we use in our proof, is the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Recall, a number ‘s’ is called irrational if it cannot be written in the form , p q where p and q are integers and q ¹ 0. Some examples of irrational numbers, with which you are already familiar, are : 2 , 2, 3, 15, , 0.10110111011110 . . . 3  , etc. Before we prove that 2 is irrational, we need the following theorem, whose proof is based on the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Theorem 1.2 : Let p be a prime number. If p divides a2, then p divides a, where a is a positive integer. *Proof : Let the prime factorisation of a be as follows : a = p1p2 . . . pn, where p1,p2, . . ., pn are primes, not necessarily distinct. Therefore, a2 = (p1p2 . . . pn)( p1p2 . . . pn) = p2 1p2 2 . . . p2 n. Now, we are given that p divides a2. Therefore, from the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, it follows that p is one of the prime factors of a2. However, using the uniqueness part of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, we realise that the only prime factors of a2 are p1, p2, . . ., pn. So p is one of p1, p2, . . ., pn. Now, since a = p1 p2 . . . pn, p divides a. We are now ready to give a proof that 2 is irrational. The proof is based on a technique called ‘proof by contradiction’. (This technique is discussed in some detail in Appendix 1). Theorem 1.3 : 2 is irrational. Proof : Let us assume, to the contrary, that 2 is rational. Reprint 2025-26"}

Suppose r and s have a common factor other than 1. Then, we divide by the common factor to get , 2 a b  where a and b are coprime. So, b 2 = a. Squaring on both sides and rearranging, we get 2b2 = a2. Therefore, 2 divides a2. Now, by Theorem 1.2, it follows that 2 divides a. So, we can write a = 2c for some integer c. Substituting for a, we get 2b2 = 4c2, that is, b2 = 2c2. This means that 2 divides b2, and so 2 divides b (again using Theorem 1.2 with p = 2). Therefore, a and b have at least 2 as a common factor. But this contradicts the fact that a and b have no common factors other than 1. This contradiction has arisen because of our incorrect assumption that 2 is rational. So, we conclude that 2 is irrational. Example 5 : Prove that 3 is irrational. Solution : Let us assume, to the contrary, that 3 is rational. That is, we can find integers a and b (¹ 0) such that 3 = a b  Suppose a and b have a common factor other than 1, then we can divide by the common factor, and assume that a and b are coprime. So, 3 b a   Squaring on both sides, and rearranging, we get 3b2 = a2. Therefore, a2 is divisible by 3, and by Theorem 1.2, it follows that a is also divisible by 3. So, we can write a = 3c for some integer c. Substituting for a, we get 3b2 = 9c2, that is, b2 = 3c2. This means that b2 is divisible by 3, and so b is also divisible by 3 (using Theorem 1.2 with p = 3). Reprint 2025-26"}

Recall that if p(x) is a polynomial in x, the highest power of x in p(x) is called the degree of the polynomial p(x). For example, 4x + 2 is a polynomial in the variable x of degree 1, 2y2 – 3y + 4 is a polynomial in the variable y of degree 2, 5x3 – 4x2 + x – 2 is a polynomial in the variable x of degree 3 and 7u6 – 4 2 3 4 8 2u u u    is a polynomial in the variable u of degree 6. Expressions like 1 1 x  , 2 x  , 2 1 2 3 x x   etc., are not polynomials. A polynomial of degree 1 is called a linear polynomial. For example, 2x – 3, 3 5, x  2 y , 2 11 x  , 3z + 4, 2 1 3u , etc., are all linear polynomials. Polynomials such as 2x + 5 – x2, x3 + 1, etc., are not linear polynomials. A polynomial of degree 2 is called a quadratic polynomial. The name ‘quadratic’ has been derived from the word ‘quadrate’, which means ‘square’. 2 2, 2 3 5 x x   y2 – 2, 2 2 3 , x x   2 2 2 2 1 2 5, 5 , 4 3 3 7 u u v v z     are some examples of quadratic polynomials (whose coefficients are real numbers).

In fact, the most general form of a cubic polynomial is ax3 + bx2 + cx + d, where, a, b, c, d are real numbers and a  0. Now consider the polynomial p(x) = x2 – 3x – 4. Then, putting x = 2 in the polynomial, we get p(2) = 22 – 3 × 2 – 4 = – 6. The value ‘– 6’, obtained by replacing x by 2 in x2 – 3x – 4, is the value of x2 – 3x – 4 at x = 2. Similarly, p(0) is the value of p(x) at x = 0, which is – 4. If p(x) is a polynomial in x, and if k is any real number, then the value obtained by replacing x by k in p(x), is called the value of p(x) at x = k, and is denoted by p(k). What is the value of p(x) = x2 –3x – 4 at x = –1? We have : p(–1) = (–1)2 –{3 × (–1)} – 4 = 0 Also, note that p(4) = 42 – (3  4) – 4 = 0. As p(–1) = 0 and p(4) = 0, –1 and 4 are called the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial x2 – 3x – 4. More generally, a real number k is said to be a zero of a polynomial p(x), if p(k) = 0. You have already studied in Class IX, how to find the zeroes of a linear polynomial. For example, if k is a zero of p(x) = 2x + 3, then p(k) = 0 gives us 2k + 3 = 0, i.e., k = 3 2   In general, if k is a zero of p(x) = ax + b, then p(k) = ak + b = 0, i.e., b k a    So, the zero of the linear polynomial ax + b is (Constant term) Coefficient of b a x    . Thus, the zero of a linear polynomial is related to its coefficients. Does this happen in the case of other polynomials too? For example, are the zeroes of a quadratic polynomial also related to its coefficients? In this chapter, we will try to answer these questions. We will also study the division algorithm for polynomials. 2.2 Geometrical Meaning of the Zeroes of a Polynomial You know that a real number k is a zero of the polynomial p(x) if p(k) = 0. But why are the zeroes of a polynomial so important? To answer this, first we will see the geometrical representations of linear and quadratic polynomials and the geometrical meaning of their zeroes.

In fact, for any quadratic polynomial ax2 + bx + c, a  0, the graph of the corresponding equation y = ax2 + bx + c has one of the two shapes either open upwards like or open downwards like depending on whether a > 0 or a < 0. (These curves are called parabolas.) You can see from Table 2.1 that –1 and 4 are zeroes of the quadratic polynomial. Also note from Fig. 2.2 that –1 and 4 are the x-coordinates of the points where the graph of y = x2 – 3x – 4 intersects the x-axis. Thus, the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial x2 – 3x – 4 are x-coordinates of the points where the graph of y = x2 – 3x – 4 intersects the x-axis. This fact is true for any quadratic polynomial, i.e., the zeroes of a quadratic polynomial ax2 + bx + c, a  0, are precisely the x-coordinates of the points where the parabola representing y = ax2 + bx + c intersects the x-axis.

She wanted to enjoy rides on the Giant Wheel and play Hoopla (a game in which you throw a ring on the items kept in a stall, and if the ring covers any object completely, you get it). The number of times she played Hoopla is half the number of rides she had on the Giant Wheel. If each ride costs ` 3, and a game of Hoopla costs ` 4, how would you find out the number of rides she had and how many times she played Hoopla, provided she spent ` 20. May be you will try it by considering different cases. If she has one ride, is it possible? Is it possible to have two rides? And so on. Or you may use the knowledge of Class IX, to represent such situations as linear equations in two variables. PAIR OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES Reprint 2025-26"}

Denote the number of rides that Akhila had by x, and the number of times she played Hoopla by y. Now the situation can be represented by the two equations: y = 1 2 x (1) 3x + 4y = 20 (2) Can we find the solutions of this pair of equations? There are several ways of finding these, which we will study in this chapter. 3.2 Graphical Method of Solution of a Pair of Linear Equations A pair of linear equations which has no solution, is called an inconsistent pair of linear equations. A pair of linear equations in two variables, which has a solution, is called a consistent pair of linear equations. A pair of linear equations which are equivalent has infinitely many distinct common solutions. Such a pair is called a dependent pair of linear equations in two variables. Note that a dependent pair of linear equations is always consistent. We can now summarise the behaviour of lines representing a pair of linear equations in two variables and the existence of solutions as follows: (i) the lines may intersect in a single point. In this case, the pair of equations has a unique solution (consistent pair of equations). (ii) the lines may be parallel. In this case, the equations have no solution (inconsistent pair of equations). (iii) the lines may be coincident. In this case, the equations have infinitely many solutions [dependent (consistent) pair of equations]. Consider the following three pairs of equations. (i) x – 2y = 0 and 3x + 4y – 20 = 0 (The lines intersect) (ii) 2x + 3y – 9 = 0 and 4x + 6y – 18 = 0 (The lines coincide) (iii) x + 2y – 4 = 0 and 2x + 4y – 12 = 0 (The lines are parallel) Let us now write down, and compare, the values of 1 1 1 2 2 2 , and a b c c a b in all the three examples.

Example 4 : Solve the following pair of equations by substitution method: 7x – 15y = 2 (1) x + 2y = 3 (2) Solution : Step 1 : We pick either of the equations and write one variable in terms of the other. Let us consider the Equation (2) : x + 2y = 3 and write it as x = 3 – 2y (3) Step 2 : Substitute the value of x in Equation (1). We get 7(3 – 2y) – 15y = 2 i.e., 21 – 14y – 15y = 2 i.e., – 29y = –19 Therefore, y = 19 29 Step 3 : Substituting this value of y in Equation (3), we get x = 3 – 19 2 29       = 49 29 Therefore, the solution is x = 49 29 , y = 19 29 .

To understand the substitution method more clearly, let us consider it stepwise: Step 1 : Find the value of one variable, say y in terms of the other variable, i.e., x from either equation, whichever is convenient. Step 2 : Substitute this value of y in the other equation, and reduce it to an equation in one variable, i.e., in terms of x, which can be solved. Sometimes, as in Examples 9 and 10 below, you can get statements with no variable. If this statement is true, you can conclude that the pair of linear equations has infinitely many solutions. If the statement is false, then the pair of linear equations is inconsistent. Step 3 : Substitute the value of x (or y) obtained in Step 2 in the equation used in Step 1 to obtain the value of the other variable. Remark : We have substituted the value of one variable by expressing it in terms of the other variable to solve the pair of linear equations. That is why the method is known as the substitution method. Example 5 : Solve the following question—Aftab tells his daughter, “Seven years ago, I was seven times as old as you were then. Also, three years from now, I shall be three times as old as you will be.” (Isn’t this interesting?) Represent this situation algebraically and graphically by the method of substitution. Solution : Let s and t be the ages (in years) of Aftab and his daughter, respectively. Then, the pair of linear equations that represent the situation is s – 7 = 7 (t – 7), i.e., s – 7t + 42 = 0 (1) and s + 3 = 3 (t + 3), i.e., s – 3t = 6 (2) Using Equation (2), we get s = 3t + 6. Putting this value of s in Equation (1), we get (3t + 6) – 7t + 42 = 0, i.e., 4t = 48, which gives t = 12. Putting this value of t in Equation (2), we get s = 3 (12) + 6 = 42 Reprint 2025-26"}

Find the cost of each pencil and each eraser. Solution : The pair of linear equations formed were: 2x + 3y = 9 (1) 4x + 6y = 18 (2) We first express the value of x in terms of y from the equation 2x + 3y = 9, to get x = 9 3 2 y − (3) Now we substitute this value of x in Equation (2), to get 4(9 3 ) 2 y − + 6y = 18 i.e., 18 – 6y + 6y = 18 i.e., 18 = 18 This statement is true for all values of y. However, we do not get a specific value of y as a solution. Therefore, we cannot obtain a specific value of x. This situation has arisen because both the given equations are the same. Therefore, Equations (1) and (2) have infinitely many solutions. We cannot find a unique cost of a pencil and an eraser, because there are many common solutions, to the given situation.

This is sometimes more convenient than the substitution method. Let us see how this method works. Example 8 : The ratio of incomes of two persons is 9 : 7 and the ratio of their expenditures is 4 : 3. If each of them manages to save ` 2000 per month, find their monthly incomes. Solution : Let us denote the incomes of the two person by ` 9x and ` 7x and their expenditures by ` 4y and ` 3y respectively. Then the equations formed in the situation is given by : 9x – 4y = 2000 (1) and 7x – 3y = 2000 (2) Step 1 : Multiply Equation (1) by 3 and Equation (2) by 4 to make the coefficients of y equal. Then we get the equations: 27x – 12y = 6000 (3) 28x – 12y = 8000 (4) Step 2 : Subtract Equation (3) from Equation (4) to eliminate y, because the coefficients of y are the same. So, we get (28x – 27x) – (12y – 12y) = 8000 – 6000 i.e., x = 2000 Step 3 : Substituting this value of x in (1), we get 9(2000) – 4y = 2000 i.e., y = 4000 So, the solution of the equations is x = 2000, y = 4000. Therefore, the monthly incomes of the persons are ` 18,000 and ` 14,000, respectively. Verification : 18000 : 14000 = 9 : 7. Also, the ratio of their expenditures = 18000 – 2000 : 14000 – 2000 = 16000 : 12000 = 4 : 3 Remarks : 1. The method used in solving the example above is called the elimination method, because we eliminate one variable first, to get a linear equation in one variable. Reprint 2025-26"}

We could also have eliminated x. Try doing it that way. 2. You could also have used the substitution, or graphical method, to solve this problem. Try doing so, and see which method is more convenient. Let us now note down these steps in the elimination method : Step 1 : First multiply both the equations by some suitable non-zero constants to make the coefficients of one variable (either x or y) numerically equal. Step 2 : Then add or subtract one equation from the other so that one variable gets eliminated. If you get an equation in one variable, go to Step 3. If in Step 2, we obtain a true statement involving no variable, then the original pair of equations has infinitely many solutions. If in Step 2, we obtain a false statement involving no variable, then the original pair of equations has no solution, i.e., it is inconsistent. Step 3 : Solve the equation in one variable (x or y) so obtained to get its value. Step 4 : Substitute this value of x (or y) in either of the original equations to get the value of the other variable. Now to illustrate it, we shall solve few more examples. Example 9 : Use elimination method to find all possible solutions of the following pair of linear equations : 2x + 3y = 8 (1) 4x + 6y = 7 (2) Solution : Step 1 : Multiply Equation (1) by 2 and Equation (2) by 1 to make the coefficients of x equal. Then we get the equations as : 4x + 6y = 16 (3) 4x + 6y = 7 (4) Step 2 : Subtracting Equation (4) from Equation (3), (4x – 4x) + (6y – 6y) = 16 – 7 i.e., 0 = 9, which is a false statement. Therefore, the pair of equations has no solution. Example 10 : The sum of a two-digit number and the number obtained by reversing the digits is 66.

(10x + y) + (10y + x) = 66 i.e., 11(x + y) = 66 i.e., x + y = 6 (1) We are also given that the digits differ by 2, therefore, either x – y = 2 (2) or y – x = 2 (3) If x – y = 2, then solving (1) and (2) by elimination, we get x = 4 and y = 2. In this case, we get the number 42. If y – x = 2, then solving (1) and (3) by elimination, we get x = 2 and y = 4. In this case, we get the number 24. Thus, there are two such numbers 42 and 24. Verification : Here 42 + 24 = 66 and 4 – 2 = 2. Also 24 + 42 = 66 and 4 – 2 = 2. EXERCISE 3.3 1.

(i) If the lines intersect at a point, then that point gives the unique solution of the two equations. In this case, the pair of equations is consistent. (ii) If the lines coincide, then there are infinitely many solutions — each point on the line being a solution. In this case, the pair of equations is dependent (consistent).

One type was the quadratic polynomial of the form ax2 + bx + c, a  0. When we equate this polynomial to zero, we get a quadratic equation. Quadratic equations come up when we deal with many real-life situations. For instance, suppose a charity trust decides to build a prayer hall having a carpet area of 300 square metres with its length one metre more than twice its breadth. What should be the length and breadth of the hall? Suppose the breadth of the hall is x metres. Then, its length should be (2x + 1) metres. We can depict this information pictorially as shown in Fig. 4.1. Now, area of the hall = (2x + 1). x m2 = (2x2 + x) m2 So, 2x2 + x = 300 (Given) Therefore, 2x2 + x – 300 = 0 So, the breadth of the hall should satisfy the equation 2x2 + x – 300 = 0 which is a quadratic equation. Many people believe that Babylonians were the first to solve quadratic equations. For instance, they knew how to find two positive numbers with a given positive sum and a given positive product, and this problem is equivalent to solving a quadratic equation of the form x2 – px + q = 0. Greek mathematician Euclid developed a geometrical approach for finding out lengths which, in our present day terminology, are solutions of quadratic equations. Solving of quadratic equations, in general form, is often credited to ancient Indian mathematicians. In fact, Brahmagupta (C.E.598–665) gave an explicit formula to solve a quadratic equation of the form ax2 + bx = c. Later, QUADRATIC EQUATIONS Fig. 4.1 Reprint 2025-26"}

An Arab mathematician Al-Khwarizmi (about C.E. 800) also studied quadratic equations of different types. Abraham bar Hiyya Ha-Nasi, in his book ‘Liber embadorum’ published in Europe in C.E. 1145 gave complete solutions of different quadratic equations. In this chapter, you will study quadratic equations, and various ways of finding their roots. You will also see some applications of quadratic equations in daily life situations. 4.2 Quadratic Equations A quadratic equation in the variable x is an equation of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b, c are real numbers, a  0. For example, 2x2 + x – 300 = 0 is a quadratic equation. Similarly, 2x2 – 3x + 1 = 0, 4x – 3x2 + 2 = 0 and 1 – x2 + 300 = 0 are also quadratic equations. In fact, any equation of the form p(x) = 0, where p(x) is a polynomial of degree 2, is a quadratic equation. But when we write the terms of p(x) in descending order of their degrees, then we get the standard form of the equation. That is, ax2 + bx + c = 0, a  0 is called the standard form of a quadratic equation. Quadratic equations arise in several situations in the world around us and in different fields of mathematics. Let us consider a few examples. Example 1 : Represent the following situations mathematically: (i) John and Jivanti together have 45 marbles. Both of them lost 5 marbles each, and the product of the number of marbles they now have is 124. We would like to find out how many marbles they had to start with. (ii) A cottage industry produces a certain number of toys in a day. The cost of production of each toy (in rupees) was found to be 55 minus the number of toys produced in a day. On a particular day, the total cost of production was ` 750. We would like to find out the number of toys produced on that day. Solution : (i) Let the number of marbles John had be x. Then the number of marbles Jivanti had = 45 – x (Why?). The number of marbles left with John, when he lost 5 marbles = x – 5 The number of marbles left with Jivanti, when she lost 5 marbles = 45 – x – 5 = 40 – x Reprint 2025-26"}

(ii) Let the number of toys produced on that day be x. Therefore, the cost of production (in rupees) of each toy that day = 55 – x So, the total cost of production (in rupees) that day = x (55 – x) Therefore, x (55 – x) = 750 i.e., 55x – x2 = 750 i.e., – x2 + 55x – 750 = 0 i.e., x2 – 55x + 750 = 0 Therefore, the number of toys produced that day satisfies the quadratic equation x2 – 55x + 750 = 0 which is the required representation of the problem mathematically.

We need to find the speed of the train. 4.3 Solution of a Quadratic Equation by Factorisation Consider the quadratic equation 2x2 – 3x + 1 = 0. If we replace x by 1 on the LHS of this equation, we get (2 × 12) – (3 × 1) + 1 = 0 = RHS of the equation. We say that 1 is a root of the quadratic equation 2x2 – 3x + 1 = 0. This also means that 1 is a zero of the quadratic polynomial 2x2 – 3x + 1. In general, a real number  is called a root of the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0, a  0 if a 2 + b + c = 0. We also say that x =  is a solution of the quadratic equation, or that  satisfies the quadratic equation. Note that the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial ax2 + bx + c and the roots of the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 are the same. You have observed, in Chapter 2, that a quadratic polynomial can have at most two zeroes. So, any quadratic equation can have atmost two roots. You have learnt in Class IX, how to factorise quadratic polynomials by splitting their middle terms. We shall use this knowledge for finding the roots of a quadratic equation. Let us see how. Example 3 : Find the roots of the equation 2x2 – 5x + 3 = 0, by factorisation. Solution : Let us first split the middle term – 5x as –2x –3x [because (–2x) × (–3x) = 6x2 = (2x2) × 3]. So, 2x2 – 5x + 3 = 2x2 – 2x – 3x + 3 = 2x (x – 1) –3(x – 1) = (2x – 3)(x – 1) Now, 2x2 – 5x + 3 = 0 can be rewritten as (2x – 3)(x – 1) = 0. So, the values of x for which 2x2 – 5x + 3 = 0 are the same for which (2x – 3)(x – 1) = 0, i.e., either 2x – 3 = 0 or x – 1 = 0. Now, 2x – 3 = 0 gives 3 2 x  and x – 1 = 0 gives x = 1. So, 3 2 x  and x = 1 are the solutions of the equation. In other words, 1 and 3 2 are the roots of the equation 2x2 – 5x + 3 = 0. Verify that these are the roots of the given equation.

If b2 – 4ac < 0, then there is no real number whose square is b2 – 4ac. Therefore, there are no real roots for the given quadratic equation in this case. Since b2 – 4ac determines whether the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 has real roots or not, b2 – 4ac is called the discriminant of this quadratic equation. So, a quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 has (i) two distinct real roots, if b2 – 4ac > 0, (ii) two equal real roots, if b2 – 4ac = 0, (iii) no real roots, if b2 – 4ac < 0. Let us consider some examples. Example 7: Find the discriminant of the quadratic equation 2x2 – 4x + 3 = 0, and hence find the nature of its roots. Solution : The given equation is of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0, where a = 2, b = – 4 and c = 3.

Is it possible to do so? If yes, at what distances from the two gates should the pole be erected? Solution : Let us first draw the diagram (see Fig. 4.2). Let P be the required location of the pole. Let the distance of the pole from the gate B be x m, i.e., BP = x m. Now the difference of the distances of the pole from the two gates = AP – BP (or, BP – AP) = 7 m. Therefore, AP = (x + 7) m.

To see if this is so or not, let us consider its discriminant. The discriminant is b2 – 4ac = 72 – 4 × 1 × (– 60) = 289 > 0. So, the given quadratic equation has two real roots, and it is possible to erect the pole on the boundary of the park.

In some, we find that the succeeding terms are obtained by adding a fixed number, in other by multiplying with a fixed number, in another we find that they are squares of consecutive numbers, and so on. In this chapter, we shall discuss one of these patterns in which succeeding terms are obtained by adding a fixed number to the preceding terms. We shall also see how to find their nth terms and the sum of n consecutive terms, and use this knowledge in solving some daily life problems. 5.2 Arithmetic Progressions Consider the following lists of numbers : (i) 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . (ii) 100, 70, 40, 10, . . . (iii) –3, –2, –1, 0, . . . (iv) 3, 3, 3, 3, . . . (v) –1.0, –1.5, –2.0, –2.5, . . . Each of the numbers in the list is called a term. Given a term, can you write the next term in each of the lists above? If so, how will you write it? Perhaps by following a pattern or rule. Let us observe and write the rule. In (i), each term is 1 more than the term preceding it. In (ii), each term is 30 less than the term preceding it. In (iii), each term is obtained by adding 1 to the term preceding it. In (iv), all the terms in the list are 3 , i.e., each term is obtained by adding (or subtracting) 0 to the term preceding it. In (v), each term is obtained by adding – 0.5 to (i.e., subtracting 0.5 from) the term preceding it. In all the lists above, we see that successive terms are obtained by adding a fixed number to the preceding terms. Such list of numbers is said to form an Arithmetic Progression ( AP ). So, an arithmetic progression is a list of numbers in which each term is obtained by adding a fixed number to the preceding term except the first term. This fixed number is called the common difference of the AP. Remember that it can be positive, negative or zero. Reprint 2025-26"}

Some more examples of AP are: (a) The heights ( in cm ) of some students of a school standing in a queue in the morning assembly are 147 , 148, 149, . . ., 157.

It is left as an exercise for you to explain why each of the lists above is an AP. You can see that a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, . . . represents an arithmetic progression where a is the first term and d the common difference. This is called the general form of an AP. Note that in examples (a) to (e) above, there are only a finite number of terms. Such an AP is called a finite AP. Also note that each of these Arithmetic Progressions (APs) has a last term. The APs in examples (i) to (v) in this section, are not finite APs and so they are called infinite Arithmetic Progressions. Such APs do not have a last term. Now, to know about an AP, what is the minimum information that you need? Is it enough to know the first term? Or, is it enough to know only the common difference? You will find that you will need to know both – the first term a and the common difference d. For instance if the first term a is 6 and the common difference d is 3, then the AP is 6, 9,12, 15, . . . and if a is 6 and d is – 3, then the AP is 6, 3, 0, –3, . . . Reprint 2025-26"}

So, if you know what a and d are, you can list the AP. What about the other way round? That is, if you are given a list of numbers can you say that it is an AP and then find a and d? Since a is the first term, it can easily be written. We know that in an AP, every succeeding term is obtained by adding d to the preceding term. So, d found by subtracting any term from its succeeding term, i.e., the term which immediately follows it should be same for an AP. For example, for the list of numbers : 6, 9, 12, 15, . . . , We have a2 – a1 = 9 – 6 = 3, a3 – a2 = 12 – 9 = 3, a4 – a3 = 15 – 12 = 3 Here the difference of any two consecutive terms in each case is 3. So, the given list is an AP whose first term a is 6 and common difference d is 3. For the list of numbers : 6, 3, 0, – 3, . . ., a2 – a1 = 3 – 6 = – 3 a3 – a2 = 0 – 3 = – 3 a4 – a3 = –3 – 0 = –3 Similarly this is also an AP whose first term is 6 and the common difference is –3. In general, for an AP a1, a2, . . ., an, we have d = ak + 1 – ak where ak + 1 and ak are the ( k + 1)th and the kth terms respectively. To obtain d in a given AP, we need not find all of a2 – a1, a3 – a2, a4 – a3, . . . . It is enough to find only one of them. Consider the list of numbers 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, . . . .

To answer this, let us first see what her monthly salary for the second year would be. It would be ` (8000 + 500) = ` 8500. In the same way, we can find the monthly salary for the 3rd, 4th and 5th year by adding ` 500 to the salary of the previous year. So, the salary for the 3rd year = ` (8500 + 500) = ` (8000 + 500 + 500) = ` (8000 + 2 × 500) = ` [8000 + (3 – 1) × 500] (for the 3rd year) = ` 9000 Salary for the 4th year = ` (9000 + 500) = ` (8000 + 500 + 500 + 500) = ` (8000 + 3 × 500) = ` [8000 + (4 – 1) × 500] (for the 4th year) = ` 9500 Salary for the 5th year = ` (9500 + 500) = ` (8000+500+500+500 + 500) = ` (8000 + 4 × 500) = ` [8000 + (5 – 1) × 500] (for the 5th year) = ` 10000 Observe that we are getting a list of numbers 8000, 8500, 9000, 9500, 10000, . . .

You would calculate this by adding ` 500 each time to the salary of the previous year to give the answer. Can we make this process shorter? Let us see. You may have already got some idea from the way we have obtained the salaries above.

How much money will be collected in the money box by the time her daughter is 21 years old? Here, the amount of money (in `) put in the money box on her first, second, third, fourth . . . birthday were respectively 100, 150, 200, 250, . . . till her 21st birthday. To find the total amount in the money box on her 21st birthday, we will have to write each of the 21 numbers in the list above and then add them up. Don’t you think it would be a tedious and time consuming process? Can we make the process shorter? This would be possible if we can find a method for getting this sum. Let us see. We consider the problem given to Gauss (about whom you read in Chapter 1), to solve when he was just 10 years old. He was asked to find the sum of the positive integers from 1 to 100. He immediately replied that the sum is 5050. Can you guess how did he do? He wrote : S = 1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + 99 + 100 And then, reversed the numbers to write S = 100 + 99 + . . . + 3 + 2 + 1 Adding these two, he got 2S = (100 + 1) + (99 + 2) + . . . + (3 + 98) + (2 + 99) + (1 + 100) = 101 + 101 + . . . + 101 + 101 (100 times) So, S = 100 101 5050 2   , i.e., the sum = 5050.

If we know any three of them, we can find the fourth. Remark : The nth term of an AP is the difference of the sum to first n terms and the sum to first (n – 1) terms of it, i.e., an = Sn – Sn – 1.

In this chapter, we shall study about those figures which have the same shape but not necessarily the same size. Two figures having the same shape (and not necessarily the same size) are called similar figures.

In fact, all these heights and distances have been found out using the idea of indirect measurements, which is based on the principle of similarity of figures (see Example 7, Q.15 of Exercise 6.3 and also Chapters 8 and 9 of this book). 6.2 Similar Figures In Class IX, you have seen that all circles with the same radii are congruent, all squares with the same side lengths are congruent and all equilateral triangles with the same side lengths are congruent. Now consider any two (or more) circles [see Fig. 6.1 (i)]. Are they congruent? Since all of them do not have the same radius, they are not congruent to each other. Note that some are congruent and some are not, but all of them have the same shape. So they all are, what we call, similar. Two similar figures have the same shape but not necessarily the same size. Therefore, all circles are similar. What about two (or more) squares or two (or more) equilateral triangles [see Fig. 6.1 (ii) and (iii)]? As observed in the case of circles, here also all squares are similar and all equilateral triangles are similar. From the above, we can say that all congruent figures are similar but the similar figures need not be congruent. Can a circle and a square be similar? Can a triangle and a square be similar? These questions can be answered by just looking at the figures (see Fig. 6.1). Evidently these figures are not similar. (Why?) Fig. 6.1 Fig. 6.2 Reprint 2025-26"}

These figures appear to be similar but we cannot be certain about it.Therefore, we must have some definition of similarity of figures and based on this definition some rules to decide whether the two given figures are similar or not. For this, let us look at the photographs given in Fig. 6.3: Fig. 6.3 You will at once say that they are the photographs of the same monument (Taj Mahal) but are in different sizes. Would you say that the three photographs are similar? Yes,they are. What can you say about the two photographs of the same size of the same person one at the age of 10 years and the other at the age of 40 years? Are these photographs similar? These photographs are of the same size but certainly they are not of the same shape. So, they are not similar. What does the photographer do when she prints photographs of different sizes from the same negative? You must have heard about the stamp size, passport size and postcard size photographs. She generally takes a photograph on a small size film, say of 35mm size and then enlarges it into a bigger size, say 45mm (or 55mm). Thus, if we consider any line segment in the smaller photograph (figure), its corresponding line segment in the bigger photograph (figure) will be 45 35 55 or 35       of that of the line segment. This really means that every line segment of the smaller photograph is enlarged (increased) in the ratio 35:45 (or 35:55). It can also be said that every line segment of the bigger photograph is reduced (decreased) in the ratio 45:35 (or 55:35). Further, if you consider inclinations (or angles) between any pair of corresponding line segments in the two photographs of different sizes, you shall see that these inclinations(or angles) are always equal. This is the essence of the similarity of two figures and in particular of two polygons. We say that: Two polygons of the same number of sides are similar, if (i) their corresponding angles are equal and (ii) their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion).

You must have heard that world maps (i.e., global maps) and blue prints for the construction of a building are prepared using a suitable scale factor and observing certain conventions. In order to understand similarity of figures more clearly, let us perform the following activity: Activity 1 : Place a lighted bulb at a point O on the ceiling and directly below it a table in your classroom. Let us cut a polygon, say a quadrilateral ABCD, from a plane cardboard and place this cardboard parallel to the ground between the lighted bulb and the table. Then a shadow of ABCD is cast on the table. Mark the outline of this shadow as ABCD (see Fig.6.4). Note that the quadrilateral ABCD is an enlargement (or magnification) of the quadrilateral ABCD. This is because of the property of light that light propogates in a straight line. You may also note that A lies on ray OA, B lies on ray OB, C lies on OC and D lies on OD. Thus, quadrilaterals ABCD and ABCD are of the same shape but of different sizes. So, quadrilateral ABCD is similiar to quadrilateral ABCD. We can also say that quadrilateral ABCD is similar to the quadrilateral ABCD.

You may recall that triangle is also a polygon. So, we can state the same conditions for the similarity of two triangles. That is: Two triangles are similiar, if (i) their corresponding angles are equal and (ii) their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion). Note that if corresponding angles of two triangles are equal, then they are known as equiangular triangles. A famous Greek mathematician Thales gave an important truth relating to two equiangular triangles which is as follows: The ratio of any two corresponding sides in two equiangular triangles is always the same. It is believed that he had used a result called the Basic Proportionality Theorem (now known as the Thales Theorem) for the same. To understand the Basic Proportionality Theorem, let us perform the following activity: Activity 2 : Draw any angle XAY and on its one arm AX, mark points (say five points) P, Q, D, R and B such that AP = PQ = QD = DR = RB.

Symbolically, we write the similarity of these two triangles as ‘ ABC ~  DEF’ and read it as ‘triangle ABC is similar to triangle DEF’. The symbol ‘~’ stands for ‘is similar to’. Recall that you have used the symbol ‘’ for ‘is congruent to’ in Class IX. It must be noted that as done in the case of congruency of two triangles, the similarity of two triangles should also be expressed symbolically, using correct correspondence of their vertices. For example, for the triangles ABC and DEF of Fig. 6.22, we cannot write  ABC ~  EDF or  ABC ~  FED. However, we can write  BAC ~  EDF. Now a natural question arises : For checking the similarity of two triangles, say ABC and DEF, should we always look for all the equality relations of their corresponding angles ( A =  D,  B =  E,  C =  F) and all the equality relations of the ratios of their corresponding sides AB BC CA DE EF FD        ? Let us examine. You may recall that in Class IX, you have obtained some criteria for congruency of two triangles involving only three pairs of corresponding parts (or elements) of the two triangles. Here also, let us make an attempt to arrive at certain criteria for similarity of two triangles involving relationship between less number of pairs of corresponding parts of the two triangles, instead of all the six pairs of corresponding parts. For this, let us perform the following activity: Activity 4 : Draw two line segments BC and EF of two different lengths, say 3 cm and 5 cm respectively. Then, at the points B and C respectively, construct angles PBC and QCB of some measures, say, 60° and 40°. Also, at the points E and F, construct angles REF and SFE of 60° and 40° respectively (see Fig. 6.23). Fig. 6.23 Reprint 2025-26"}

Thus, AB BC CA DE EF FD    You can repeat this activity by constructing several pairs of triangles having their corresponding angles equal. Every time, you will find that their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion). This activity leads us to the following criterion for similarity of two triangles. Theorem 6.3 : If in two triangles, corresponding angles are equal, then their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion) and hence the two triangles are similar. This criterion is referred to as the AAA (Angle–Angle–Angle) criterion of similarity of two triangles.

In other words, if the sides of a triangle are respectively proportional to the sides of another triangle, is it true that their corresponding angles are equal?

The distance of a point from the y-axis is called its x-coordinate, or abscissa. The distance of a point from the x-axis is called its y-coordinate, or ordinate. The coordinates of a point on the x-axis are of the form (x, 0), and of a point on the y-axis are of the form (0, y). Here is a play for you. Draw a set of a pair of perpendicular axes on a graph paper. Now plot the following points and join them as directed: Join the point A(4, 8) to B(3, 9) to C(3, 8) to D(1, 6) to E(1, 5) to F(3, 3) to G(6, 3) to H(8, 5) to I(8, 6) to J(6, 8) to K(6, 9) to L(5, 8) to A. Then join the points P(3.5, 7), Q (3, 6) and R(4, 6) to form a triangle. Also join the points X(5.5, 7), Y(5, 6) and Z(6, 6) to form a triangle. Now join S(4, 5), T(4.5, 4) and U(5, 5) to form a triangle. Lastly join S to the points (0, 5) and (0, 6) and join U to the points (9, 5) and (9, 6). What picture have you got? Also, you have seen that a linear equation in two variables of the form ax + by + c = 0, (a, b are not simultaneously zero), when represented graphically, gives a straight line. Further, in Chapter 2, you have seen the graph of y = ax2 + bx + c (a ¹ 0), is a parabola. In fact, coordinate geometry has been developed as an algebraic tool for studying geometry of figures. It helps us to study geometry using algebra, and understand algebra with the help of geometry. Because of this, coordinate geometry is widely applied in various fields such as physics, engineering, navigation, seismology and art! In this chapter, you will learn how to find the distance between the two points whose coordinates are given. You will also study how to find the coordinates of the point which divides a line segment joining two given points in a given ratio. COORDINATE GEOMETRY Reprint 2025-26"}

How would you find the distance from town A to town B without actually measuring it. Let us see. This situation can be represented graphically as shown in Fig. 7.1. You may use the Pythagoras Theorem to calculate this distance. Now, suppose two points lie on the x-axis. Can we find the distance between them? For instance, consider two points A(4, 0) and B(6, 0) in Fig. 7.2. The points A and B lie on the x-axis. From the figure you can see that OA = 4 units and OB = 6 units. Therefore, the distance of B from A, i.e., AB = OB – OA = 6 – 4 = 2 units. So, if two points lie on the x-axis, we can easily find the distance between them. Now, suppose we take two points lying on the y-axis. Can you find the distance between them. If the points C(0, 3) and D(0, 8) lie on the y-axis, similarly we find that CD = 8 – 3 = 5 units (see Fig. 7.2). Next, can you find the distance of A from C (in Fig. 7.2)? Since OA = 4 units and OC = 3 units, the distance of A from C, i.e., AC = 2 2 3 4  = 5 units. Similarly, you can find the distance of B from D = BD = 10 units. Now, if we consider two points not lying on coordinate axis, can we find the distance between them? Yes! We shall use Pythagoras theorem to do so. Let us see an example. In Fig. 7.3, the points P(4, 6) and Q(6, 8) lie in the first quadrant. How do we use Pythagoras theorem to find the distance between them? Let us draw PR and QS perpendicular to the x-axis from P and Q respectively. Also, draw a perpendicular from P on QS to meet QS at T. Then the coordinates of R and S are (4, 0) and (6, 0), respectively. So, RS = 2 units. Also, QS = 8 units and TS = PR = 6 units. Fig. 7.1 Fig. 7.2 Reprint 2025-26"}

If P lies on AB, it will divide AB in the ratio 1 : 2 (see Fig. 7.9). If we take A as the origin O, and 1 km as one unit on both the axis, the coordinates of B will be (36, 15). In order to know the position of the tower, we must know the coordinates of P. How do we find these coordinates? Let the coordinates of P be (x, y). Draw perpendiculars from P and B to the x-axis, meeting it in D and E, respectively. Draw PC perpendicular to BE.

Herbart (1890) 8.1 Introduction You have already studied about triangles, and in particular, right triangles, in your earlier classes. Let us take some examples from our surroundings where right triangles can be imagined to be formed. For instance : 1. Suppose the students of a school are visiting Qutub Minar. Now, if a student is looking at the top of the Minar, a right triangle can be imagined to be made, as shown in Fig 8.1. Can the student find out the height of the Minar, without actually measuring it? 2. Suppose a girl is sitting on the balcony of her house located on the bank of a river. She is looking down at a flower pot placed on a stair of a temple situated nearby on the other bank of the river. A right triangle is imagined to be made in this situation as shown in Fig.8.2. If you know the height at which the person is sitting, can you find the width of the river? INTRODUCTION TO TRIGONOMETRY Fig. 8.1 Fig. 8.2 Reprint 2025-26"}

A girl happens to spot the balloon in the sky and runs to her mother to tell her about it. Her mother rushes out of the house to look at the balloon.Now when the girl had spotted the balloon intially it was at point A. When both the mother and daughter came out to see it, it had already travelled to another point B. Can you find the altitude of B from the ground? In all the situations given above, the distances or heights can be found by using some mathematical techniques, which come under a branch of mathematics called ‘trigonometry’. The word ‘trigonometry’ is derived from the Greek words ‘tri’ (meaning three), ‘gon’ (meaning sides) and ‘metron’ (meaning measure). In fact, trigonometry is the study of relationships between the sides and angles of a triangle. The earliest known work on trigonometry was recorded in Egypt and Babylon. Early astronomers used it to find out the distances of the stars and planets from the Earth. Even today, most of the technologically advanced methods used in Engineering and Physical Sciences are based on trigonometrical concepts. In this chapter, we will study some ratios of the sides of a right triangle with respect to its acute angles, called trigonometric ratios of the angle. We will restrict our discussion to acute angles only. However, these ratios can be extended to other angles also. We will also define the trigonometric ratios for angles of measure 0° and 90°. We will calculate trigonometric ratios for some specific angles and establish some identities involving these ratios, called trigonometric identities. 8.2 Trigonometric Ratios In Section 8.1, you have seen some right triangles imagined to be formed in different situations. Let us take a right triangle ABC as shown in Fig. 8.4. Here,  CAB (or, in brief, angle A) is an acute angle. Note the position of the side BC with respect to angle A. It faces  A. We call it the side opposite to angle A. AC is the hypotenuse of the right triangle and the side AB is a part of  A. So, we call it the side adjacent to angle A. Fig. 8.4 Fig. 8.3 Reprint 2025-26"}

You have studied the concept of ‘ratio’ in your earlier classes. We now define certain ratios involving the sides of a right triangle, and call them trigonometric ratios. The trigonometric ratios of the angle A in right triangle ABC (see Fig. 8.4) are defined as follows : sine of  A = side opposite to angle A BC hypotenuse AC  cosine of  A = side adjacent to angle A AB hypotenuse AC  tangent of  A = side opposite to angle A BC side adjacent to angle A AB  cosecant of  A = 1 hypotenuse AC sine of A side opposite to angle A BC    secant of  A = 1 hypotenuse AC cosine of A side adjacent to angle A AB    cotangent of  A = 1 side adjacent to angle A AB tangent of A side opposite to angle A BC    The ratios defined above are abbreviated as sin A, cos A, tan A, cosec A, sec A and cot A respectively.

{"class": "class 10", "subject": "maths", "page_no": 130, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "116 MATHEMATICS The first use of the idea of ‘sine’ in the way we use it today was in the work Aryabhatiyam by Aryabhata, in A.D. 500. Aryabhata used the word ardha-jya for the half-chord, which was shortened to jya or jiva in due course. When the Aryabhatiyam was translated into Arabic, the word jiva was retained as it is. The word jiva was translated into sinus, which means curve, when the Arabic version was translated into Latin. Soon the word sinus, also used as sine, became common in mathematical texts throughout Europe. An English Professor of astronomy Edmund Gunter (1581–1626), first used the abbreviated notation ‘sin’. The origin of the terms ‘cosine’ and ‘tangent’ was much later. The cosine function arose from the need to compute the sine of the complementary angle. Aryabhatta called it kotijya. The name cosinus originated with Edmund Gunter. In 1674, the English Mathematician Sir Jonas Moore first used the abbreviated notation ‘cos’. Remark : Note that the symbol sin A is used as an abbreviation for ‘the sine of the angle A’. sin A is not the product of ‘sin’ and A. ‘sin’ separated from A has no meaning. Similarly, cos A is not the product of ‘cos’ and A. Similar interpretations follow for other trigonometric ratios also. Now, if we take a point P on the hypotenuse AC or a point Q on AC extended, of the right triangle ABC and draw PM perpendicular to AB and QN perpendicular to AB extended (see Fig. 8.6), how will the trigonometric ratios of  A in  PAM differ from those of  A in  CAB or from those of  A in  QAN? To answer this, first look at these triangles. Is  PAM similar to  CAB? From Chapter 6, recall the AA similarity criterion. Using the criterion, you will see that the triangles PAM and CAB are similar. Therefore, by the property of similar triangles, the corresponding sides of the triangles are proportional. So, we have AM AB = AP MP AC BC   Aryabhata C.E. 476 – 550 Fig. 8.6 Reprint 2025-26"}

Similarly, AM AB AP AC  = cos A, MP BC tan A AM AB   and so on. This shows that the trigonometric ratios of angle A in  PAM not differ from those of angle A in  CAB. In the same way, you should check that the value of sin A (and also of other trigonometric ratios) remains the same in  QAN also. From our observations, it is now clear that the values of the trigonometric ratios of an angle do not vary with the lengths of the sides of the triangle, if the angle remains the same. Note : For the sake of convenience, we may write sin2A, cos2A, etc., in place of (sin A)2, (cos A)2, etc., respectively. But cosec A = (sin A)–1  sin–1 A (it is called sine inverse A). sin–1 A has a different meaning, which will be discussed in higher classes. Similar conventions hold for the other trigonometric ratios as well. Sometimes, the Greek letter  (theta) is also used to denote an angle. We have defined six trigonometric ratios of an acute angle. If we know any one of the ratios, can we obtain the other ratios? Let us see. If in a right triangle ABC, sin A = 1, 3 then this means that BC 1 AC 3  , i.e., the lengths of the sides BC and AC of the triangle ABC are in the ratio 1 : 3 (see Fig. 8.7). So if BC is equal to k, then AC will be 3k, where k is any positive number. To determine other trigonometric ratios for the angle A, we need to find the length of the third side AB. Do you remember the Pythagoras theorem? Let us use it to determine the required length AB. AB2 = AC2 – BC2 = (3k)2 – (k)2 = 8k2 = (2 2 k)2 Therefore, AB = 2 2 k  So, we get AB = 2 2 k (Why is AB not – 2 2 k ?)

Similarly, an equation involving trigonometric ratios of an angle is called a trigonometric identity, if it is true for all values of the angle(s) involved. In this section, we will prove one trigonometric identity, and use it further to prove other useful trigonometric identities.

In this case, the line of sight is below the horizontal level. The angle so formed by the line of sight with the horizontal is called the angle of depression. Thus, the angle of depression of a point on the object being viewed is the angle formed by the line of sight with the horizontal when the point is below the horizontal level, i.e., the case when we lower our head to look at the point being viewed (see Fig. 9.3).

Assuming that the above three conditions are known, how can we determine the height of the minar? In the figure, CD = CB + BD. Here, BD = AE, which is the height of the student. To find BC, we will use trigonometric ratios of  BAC or  A. In  ABC, the side BC is the opposite side in relation to the known  A. Now, which of the trigonometric ratios can we use? Which one of them has the two values that we have and the one we need to determine? Our search narrows down to using either tan A or cot A, as these ratios involve AB and BC. Therefore, tan A = BC AB or cot A = AB, BC which on solving would give us BC. By adding AE to BC, you will get the height of the minar. Now let us explain the process, we have just discussed, by solving some problems. Example 1 : A tower stands vertically on the ground. From a point on the ground, which is 15 m away from the foot of the tower, the angle of elevation of the top of the tower is found to be 60°. Find the height of the tower. Solution : First let us draw a simple diagram to represent the problem (see Fig. 9.4).

Also, ACB is a triangle, right-angled at B. To solve the problem, we choose the trigonometric ratio tan 60° (or cot 60°), as the ratio involves AB and BC. Now, tan 60° = AB BC i.e., 3 = AB 15 i.e., AB = 15 3 Hence, the height of the tower is 15 3 m. Fig. 9.4 Reprint 2025-26"}

You have also studied various terms related to a circle like chord, segment, sector, arc etc. Let us now examine the different situations that can arise when a circle and a line are given in a plane. So, let us consider a circle and a line PQ. There can be three possibilities given in Fig. 10.1 below: Fig. 10.1 In Fig. 10.1 (i), the line PQ and the circle have no common point. In this case, PQ is called a non-intersecting line with respect to the circle. In Fig. 10.1 (ii), there are two common points A and B that the line PQ and the circle have. In this case, we call the line PQ a secant of the circle. In Fig. 10.1 (iii), there is only one point A which is common to the line PQ and the circle. In this case, the line is called a tangent to the circle. CIRCLES Reprint 2025-26"}

Look at Fig. 10.2. Here the rope on both sides of the pulley, if considered as a ray, is like a tangent to the circle representing the pulley. Is there any position of the line with respect to the circle other than the types given above? You can see that there cannot be any other type of position of the line with respect to the circle. In this chapter, we will study about the existence of the tangents to a circle and also study some of their properties. 10.2 Tangent to a Circle In the previous section, you have seen that a tangent* to a circle is a line that intersects the circle at only one point. To understand the existence of the tangent to a circle at a point, let us perform the following activities: Activity 1 : Take a circular wire and attach a straight wire AB at a point P of the circular wire so that it can rotate about the point P in a plane. Put the system on a table and gently rotate the wire AB about the point P to get different positions of the straight wire [see Fig. 10.3(i)]. In various positions, the wire intersects the circular wire at P and at another point Q1 or Q2 or Q3, etc. In one position, you will see that it will intersect the circle at the point P only (see position AB of AB). This shows that a tangent exists at the point P of the circle. On rotating further, you can observe that in all other positions of AB, it will intersect the circle at P and at another point, say R1 or R2 or R3, etc. So, you can observe that there is only one tangent at a point of the circle. While doing activity above, you must have observed that as the position AB moves towards the position A B, the common point, say Q1, of the line AB and the circle gradually comes nearer and nearer to the common point P. Ultimately, it coincides with the point P in the position AB of AB. Again note, what happens if ‘AB’ is rotated rightwards about P? The common point R3 gradually comes nearer and nearer to P and ultimately coincides with P. So, what we see is: The tangent to a circle is a special case of the secant, when the two end points of its corresponding chord coincide.

Draw various lines parallel to the secant on both sides of it. You will find that after some steps, the length of the chord cut by the lines will gradually decrease, i.e., the two points of intersection of the line and the circle are coming closer and closer [see Fig. 10.3(ii)]. In one case, it becomes zero on one side of the secant and in another case, it becomes zero on the other side of the secant. See the positions PQ and PQ of the secant in Fig. 10.3 (ii). These are the tangents to the circle parallel to the given secant PQ. This also helps you to see that there cannot be more than two tangents parallel to a given secant. This activity also establishes, what you must have observed, while doing Activity 1, namely, a tangent is the secant when both of the end points of the corresponding chord coincide. The common point of the tangent and the circle is called the point of contact [the point A in Fig. 10.1 (iii)]and the tangent is said to touch the circle at the common point. Now look around you. Have you seen a bicycle or a cart moving? Look at its wheels. All the spokes of a wheel are along its radii. Now note the position of the wheel with respect to its movement on the ground. Do you see any tangent anywhere? (See Fig. 10.4). In fact, the wheel moves along a line which is a tangent to the circle representing the wheel. Also, notice that in all positions, the radius through the point of contact with the ground appears to be at right angles to the tangent (see Fig. 10.4). We shall now prove this property of the tangent. Theorem 10.1 : The tangent at any point of a circle is perpendicular to the radius through the point of contact. Proof : We are given a circle with centre O and a tangent XY to the circle at a point P. We need to prove that OP is perpendicular to XY. Fig. 10.4 Fig. 10.3 (ii) Reprint 2025-26"}

The point Q must lie outside the circle. (Why? Note that if Q lies inside the circle, XY will become a secant and not a tangent to the circle). Therefore, OQ is longer than the radius OP of the circle. That is, OQ > OP. Since this happens for every point on the line XY except the point P, OP is the shortest of all the distances of the point O to the points of XY. So OP is perpendicular to XY. (as shown in Theorem A1.7.) Remarks 1. By theorem above, we can also conclude that at any point on a circle there can be one and only one tangent. 2. The line containing the radius through the point of contact is also sometimes called the ‘normal’ to the circle at the point. EXERCISE 10.1 1. How many tangents can a circle have? 2.

Can you draw a tangent to the circle through this point? You will find that all the lines through this point intersect the circle in two points. So, it is not possible to draw any tangent to a circle through a point inside it [see Fig. 10.6 (i)]. Next take a point P on the circle and draw tangents through this point. You have already observed that there is only one tangent to the circle at such a point [see Fig. 10.6 (ii)]. Finally, take a point P outside the circle and try to draw tangents to the circle from this point. What do you observe? You will find that you can draw exactly two tangents to the circle through this point [see Fig. 10.6 (iii)]. We can summarise these facts as follows: Case 1 : There is no tangent to a circle passing through a point lying inside the circle. Case 2 : There is one and only one tangent to a circle passing through a point lying on the circle. Case 3 : There are exactly two tangents to a circle through a point lying outside the circle. In Fig. 10.6 (iii), T1and T2 are the points of contact of the tangents PT1 and PT2 respectively. The length of the segment of the tangent from the external point P and the point of contact with the circle is called the length of the tangent from the point P to the circle. Note that in Fig. 10.6 (iii), PT1 and PT2 are the lengths of the tangents from P to the circle. The lengths PT1 and PT2 have a common property. Can you find this? Measure PT1 and PT2.

Proof : We are given a circle with centre O, a point P lying outside the circle and two tangents PQ, PR on the circle from P (see Fig. 10.7). We are required to prove that PQ = PR. For this, we join OP, OQ and OR. Then ∠ OQP and ∠ ORP are right angles, because these are angles between the radii and tangents, and according to Theorem 10.1 they are right angles. Now in right triangles OQP and ORP, OQ = OR (Radii of the same circle) OP = OP (Common) Therefore, ∆ OQP ≅∆ ORP (RHS) This gives PQ = PR (CPCT) Remarks 1. The theorem can also be proved by using the Pythagoras Theorem as follows: PQ2 = OP2 – OQ2 = OP2 – OR2 = PR2 (As OQ = OR) which gives PQ = PR. 2. Note also that ∠ OPQ = ∠ OPR. Therefore, OP is the angle bisector of ∠ QPR, i.e., the centre lies on the bisector of the angle between the two tangents. Let us take some examples.

Recall that the portion (or part) of the circular region enclosed by two radii and the corresponding arc is called a sector of the circle and the portion (or part) of the circular region enclosed between a chord and the corresponding arc is called a segment of the circle. Thus, in Fig. 11.1, shaded region OAPB is a sector of the circle with centre O. ∠ AOB is called the angle of the sector. Note that in this figure, unshaded region OAQB is also a sector of the circle. For obvious reasons, OAPB is called the minor sector and OAQB is called the major sector. You can also see that angle of the major sector is 360° – ∠ AOB. Now, look at Fig. 11.2 in which AB is a chord of the circle with centre O. So, shaded region APB is a segment of the circle. You can also note that unshaded region AQB is another segment of the circle formed by the chord AB. For obvious reasons, APB is called the minor segment and AQB is called the major segment.

Let OAPB be a sector of a circle with centre O and radius r (see Fig. 11.3). Let the degree measure of Ð AOB be q. You know that area of a circle (in fact of a circular region or disc) is pr2. In a way, we can consider this circular region to be a sector forming an angle of 360° (i.e., of degree measure 360) at the centre O. Now by applying the Unitary Method, we can arrive at the area of the sector OAPB as follows: When degree measure of the angle at the centre is 360, area of the sector = pr2 So, when the degree measure of the angle at the centre is 1, area of the sector = 2 360 r   Therefore, when the degree measure of the angle at the centre is q, area of the sector = 2 360 r   = 2 360 r  . Thus, we obtain the following relation (or formula) for area of a sector of a circle: Area of the sector of angle q =  r   2 360 , where r is the radius of the circle and q the angle of the sector in degrees. Now, a natural question arises : Can we find the length of the arc APB corresponding to this sector? Yes. Again, by applying the Unitary Method and taking the whole length of the circle (of angle 360°) as 2pr, we can obtain the required length of the arc APB as 2 360 r .

A test tube, right! You would have used one in your science laboratory. This tube is also a combination of a cylinder and a hemisphere. Similarly, while travelling, you may have seen some big and beautiful buildings or monuments made up of a combination of solids mentioned above. If for some reason you wanted to find the surface areas, or volumes, or capacities of such objects, how would you do it? We cannot classify these under any of the solids you have already studied. In this chapter, you will see how to find surface areas and volumes of such objects. 12.2 Surface Area of a Combination of Solids Let us consider the container seen in Fig. 12.2. How do we find the surface area of such a solid? Now, whenever we come across a new problem, we first try to see, if we can break it down into smaller problems, we have earlier solved. We can see that this solid is made up of a cylinder with two hemispheres stuck at either end. It would look like what we have in Fig. 12.4, after we put the pieces all together. Fig. 12.4 If we consider the surface of the newly formed object, we would be able to see only the curved surfaces of the two hemispheres and the curved surface of the cylinder. So, the total surface area of the new solid is the sum of the curved surface areas of each of the individual parts. This gives, TSA of new solid = CSA of one hemisphere + CSA of cylinder + CSA of other hemisphere where TSA, CSA stand for ‘Total Surface Area’ and ‘Curved Surface Area’ respectively. Let us now consider another situation. Suppose we are making a toy by putting together a hemisphere and a cone. Let us see the steps that we would be going through. Fig. 12.3 Reprint 2025-26"}

Here, of course, we would take the base radius of the cone equal to the radius of the hemisphere, for the toy is to have a smooth surface. So, the steps would be as shown in Fig. 12.5. Fig. 12.5 At the end of our trial, we have got ourselves a nice round-bottomed toy. Now if we want to find how much paint we would require to colour the surface of this toy, what would we need to know? We would need to know the surface area of the toy, which consists of the CSA of the hemisphere and the CSA of the cone. So, we can say: Total surface area of the toy = CSA of hemisphere + CSA of cone Now, let us consider some examples. Example 1 : Rasheed got a playing top (lattu) as his birthday present, which surprisingly had no colour on it. He wanted to colour it with his crayons. The top is shaped like a cone surmounted by a hemisphere (see Fig 12.6). The entire top is 5 cm in height and the diameter of the top is 3.5 cm. Find the area he has to colour. (Take  = 22 7 ) Solution : This top is exactly like the object we have discussed in Fig. 12.5. So, we can conveniently use the result we have arrived at there.

Here, we shall see how to calculate their volumes. It may be noted that in calculating the surface area, we have not added the surface areas of the two constituents, because some part of the surface area disappeared in the process of joining them. However, this will not be the case when we calculate the volume. The volume of the solid formed by joining two basic solids will actually be the sum of the volumes of the constituents, as we see in the examples below. Example 5 : Shanta runs an industry in a shed which is in the shape of a cuboid surmounted by a half cylinder (see Fig. 12.12). If the base of the shed is of dimension 7 m × 15 m, and the height of the cuboidal portion is 8 m, find the volume of air that the shed can hold.

You have also learnt to represent the data pictorially in the form of various graphs such as bar graphs, histograms (including those of varying widths) and frequency polygons. In fact, you went a step further by studying certain numerical representatives of the ungrouped data, also called measures of central tendency, namely, mean, median and mode. In this chapter, we shall extend the study of these three measures, i.e., mean, median and mode from ungrouped data to that of grouped data. We shall also discuss the concept of cumulative frequency, the cumulative frequency distribution and how to draw cumulative frequency curves, called ogives. 13.2 Mean of Grouped Data The mean (or average) of observations, as we know, is the sum of the values of all the observations divided by the total number of observations. From Class IX, recall that if x1, x2,. . ., xn are observations with respective frequencies f1, f2, . . ., fn, then this means observation x1 occurs f1 times, x2 occurs f2 times, and so on. Now, the sum of the values of all the observations = f1x1 + f2x2 + . . . + fnxn, and the number of observations = f1 + f2 + . . . + fn.

In most of our real life situations, data is usually so large that to make a meaningful study it needs to be condensed as grouped data. So, we need to convert given ungrouped data into grouped data and devise some method to find its mean. Let us convert the ungrouped data of Example 1 into grouped data by forming class-intervals of width, say 15. Remember that, while allocating frequencies to each class-interval, students falling in any upper class-limit would be considered in the next class, e.g., 4 students who have obtained 40 marks would be considered in the class- interval 40-55 and not in 25-40. With this convention in our mind, let us form a grouped frequency distribution table (see Table 13.2).

It is assumed that the frequency of each class- interval is centred around its mid-point. So the mid-point (or class mark) of each class can be chosen to represent the observations falling in the class. Recall that we find the mid-point of a class (or its class mark) by finding the average of its upper and lower limits. That is, Class mark = Upper class limit + Lower class limit 2 With reference to Table 13.2, for the class 10-25, the class mark is 10 25 2 + , i.e., 17.5. Similarly, we can find the class marks of the remaining class intervals. We put them in Table 13.3. These class marks serve as our xi’s. Now, in general, for the ith class interval, we have the frequency fi corresponding to the class mark xi. We can now proceed to compute the mean in the same manner as in Example 1. Reprint 2025-26"}

We observe that Tables 13.1 and 13.3 are using the same data and employing the same formula for the calculation of the mean but the results obtained are different.

The difference in the two values is because of the mid-point assumption in Table 13.3, 59.3 being the exact mean, while 62 an approximate mean. Sometimes when the numerical values of xi and fi are large, finding the product of xi and fi becomes tedious and time consuming. So, for such situations, let us think of a method of reducing these calculations. We can do nothing with the fi’s, but we can change each xi to a smaller number so that our calculations become easy. How do we do this? What about subtracting a fixed number from each of these xi’s? Let us try this method. The first step is to choose one among the xi’s as the assumed mean, and denote it by ‘a’. Also, to further reduce our calculation work, we may take ‘a’ to be that xi which lies in the centre of x1, x2, . . ., xn. So, we can choose a = 47.5 or a = 62.5. Let us choose a = 47.5. The next step is to find the difference di between a and each of the xi’s, that is, the deviation of ‘a’ from each of the xi’s. i.e., di = xi – a = xi – 47.5 Reprint 2025-26"}

You will find that the mean determined in each case is the same, i.e., 62. (Why ?) So, we can say that the value of the mean obtained does not depend on the choice of ‘a’. Observe that in Table 13.4, the values in Column 4 are all multiples of 15. So, if we divide the values in the entire Column 4 by 15, we would get smaller numbers to multiply with fi. (Here, 15 is the class size of each class interval.) So, let ui = ix a h − , where a is the assumed mean and h is the class size. Now, we calculate ui in this way and continue as before (i.e., find fi ui and then Σfiui). Taking h = 15, let us form Table 13.5.

Further, we discussed finding the mode of ungrouped data. Here, we shall discuss ways of obtaining a mode of grouped data. It is possible that more than one value may have the same maximum frequency. In such situations, the data is said to be multimodal. Though grouped data can also be multimodal, we shall restrict ourselves to problems having a single mode only. Let us first recall how we found the mode for ungrouped data through the following example. Example 4 : The wickets taken by a bowler in 10 cricket matches are as follows: 2 6 4 5 0 2 1 3 2 3 Find the mode of the data. Solution : Let us form the frequency distribution table of the given data as follows: Number of 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 wickets Number of 1 1 3 2 1 1 1 matches Reprint 2025-26"}
{"class": "class 10", "subject": "maths", "page_no": 198, "ocr_used": false, "language": "en", "text": "184 MATHEMATICS Clearly, 2 is the number of wickets taken by the bowler in the maximum number (i.e., 3) of matches. So, the mode of this data is 2. In a grouped frequency distribution, it is not possible to determine the mode by looking at the frequencies. Here, we can only locate a class with the maximum frequency, called the modal class. The mode is a value inside the modal class, and is given by the formula: Mode = 1 0 1 0 2 2 f f l h f f f            where l = lower limit of the modal class, h = size of the class interval (assuming all class sizes to be equal), f1 = frequency of the modal class, f0 = frequency of the class preceding the modal class, f2 = frequency of the class succeeding the modal class. Let us consider the following examples to illustrate the use of this formula. Example 5 : A survey conducted on 20 households in a locality by a group of students resulted in the following frequency table for the number of family members in a household: Family size 1 - 3 3 - 5 5 - 7 7 - 9 9 - 11 Number of 7 8 2 2 1 families Find the mode of this data. Solution : Here the maximum class frequency is 8, and the class corresponding to this frequency is 3 – 5. So, the modal class is 3 – 5. Now modal class = 3 – 5, lower limit (l) of modal class = 3, class size (h) = 2 frequency ( f1) of the modal class = 8, frequency ( f0) of class preceding the modal class = 7, frequency ( f2) of class succeeding the modal class = 2. Now, let us substitute these values in the formula : Reprint 2025-26"}

Example 6 : The marks distribution of 30 students in a mathematics examination are given in Table 13.3 of Example 1. Find the mode of this data. Also compare and interpret the mode and the mean. Solution : Refer to Table 13.3 of Example 1. Since the maximum number of students (i.e., 7) have got marks in the interval 40 - 55, the modal class is 40 - 55. Therefore, the lower limit (l) of the modal class = 40, the class size (h) = 15, the frequency ( f1) of modal class = 7, the frequency ( f0) of the class preceding the modal class = 3, the frequency ( f2) of the class succeeding the modal class = 6.

In Example 6, the mode is less than the mean. But for some other problems it may be equal or more than the mean also. 2.

We give them in Table 13.13 given below: Table 13.13 Marks obtained Number of students (Cumulative frequency) Less than 10 5 Less than 20 5 + 3 = 8 Less than 30 8 + 4 = 12 Less than 40 12 + 3 = 15 Less than 50 15 + 3 = 18 Less than 60 18 + 4 = 22 Less than 70 22 + 7 = 29 Less than 80 29 + 9 = 38 Less than 90 38 + 7 = 45 Less than 100 45 + 8 = 53 The distribution given above is called the cumulative frequency distribution of the less than type. Here 10, 20, 30, . . . 100, are the upper limits of the respective class intervals. We can similarly make the table for the number of students with scores, more than or equal to 0, more than or equal to 10, more than or equal to 20, and so on. From Table 13.12, we observe that all 53 students have scored marks more than or equal to 0. Since there are 5 students scoring marks in the interval 0 - 10, this means that there are 53 – 5 = 48 students getting more than or equal to 10 marks. Continuing in the same manner, we get the number of students scoring 20 or above as 48 – 3 = 45, 30 or above as 45 – 4 = 41, and so on, as shown in Table 13.14. Reprint 2025-26"}

Solution : To calculate the median height, we need to find the class intervals and their corresponding frequencies.

The mean is the most frequently used measure of central tendency because it takes into account all the observations, and lies between the extremes, i.e., the largest and the smallest observations of the entire data. It also enables us to compare two or more distributions. For example, by comparing the average (mean) results of students of different schools of a particular examination, we can conclude which school has a better performance. However, extreme values in the data affect the mean. For example, the mean of classes having frequencies more or less the same is a good representative of the data. But, if one class has frequency, say 2, and the five others have frequency 20, 25, 20, 21, 18, then the mean will certainly not reflect the way the data behaves. So, in such cases, the mean is not a good representative of the data. In problems where individual observations are not important, and we wish to find out a ‘typical’ observation, the median is more appropriate, e.g., finding the typical productivity rate of workers, average wage in a country, etc. These are situations where extreme values may be there. So, rather than the mean, we take the median as a better measure of central tendency. In situations which require establishing the most frequent value or most popular item, the mode is the best choice, e.g., to find the most popular T.V. programme being watched, the consumer item in greatest demand, the colour of the vehicle used by most of the people, etc. Remarks : 1.

Woodward 14.1 Probability — A Theoretical Approach Let us consider the following situation : Suppose a coin is tossed at random. When we speak of a coin, we assume it to be ‘fair’, that is, it is symmetrical so that there is no reason for it to come down more often on one side than the other. We call this property of the coin as being ‘unbiased’. By the phrase ‘random toss’, we mean that the coin is allowed to fall freely without any bias or interference. We know, in advance, that the coin can only land in one of two possible ways — either head up or tail up (we dismiss the possibility of its ‘landing’ on its edge, which may be possible, for example, if it falls on sand). We can reasonably assume that each outcome, head or tail, is as likely to occur as the other. We refer to this by saying that the outcomes head and tail, are equally likely. For another example of equally likely outcomes, suppose we throw a die once. For us, a die will always mean a fair die. What are the possible outcomes? They are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Each number has the same possibility of showing up. So the equally likely outcomes of throwing a die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. PROBABILITY Reprint 2025-26"}

Suppose that a bag contains 4 red balls and 1 blue ball, and you draw a ball without looking into the bag. What are the outcomes? Are the outcomes — a red ball and a blue ball equally likely? Since there are 4 red balls and only one blue ball, you would agree that you are more likely to get a red ball than a blue ball. So, the outcomes (a red ball or a blue ball) are not equally likely. However, the outcome of drawing a ball of any colour from the bag is equally likely. So, all experiments do not necessarily have equally likely outcomes. However, in this chapter, from now on, we will assume that all the experiments have equally likely outcomes. In Class IX, we defined the experimental or empirical probability P(E) of an event E as P(E) = Number of trials in which the event happened Total number of trials The empirical interpretation of probability can be applied to every event associated with an experiment which can be repeated a large number of times. The requirement of repeating an experiment has some limitations, as it may be very expensive or unfeasible in many situations. Of course, it worked well in coin tossing or die throwing experiments. But how about repeating the experiment of launching a satellite in order to compute the empirical probability of its failure during launching, or the repetition of the phenomenon of an earthquake to compute the empirical probability of a multi- storeyed building getting destroyed in an earthquake? In experiments where we are prepared to make certain assumptions, the repetition of an experiment can be avoided, as the assumptions help in directly calculating the exact (theoretical) probability. The assumption of equally likely outcomes (which is valid in many experiments, as in the two examples above, of a coin and of a die) is one such assumption that leads us to the following definition of probability of an event. The theoretical probability (also called classical probability) of an event E, written as P(E), is defined as P(E) = Number of outcomes favourable to E Number of all possible outcomes of the experiment , where we assume that the outcomes of the experiment are equally likely. We will briefly refer to theoretical probability as probability. This definition of probability was given by Pierre Simon Laplace in 1795. Reprint 2025-26"}

Since its inception, the study of probability has attracted the attention of great mathematicians. James Bernoulli (1654 – 1705), A. de Moivre (1667 – 1754), and Pierre Simon Laplace are among those who made significant contributions to this field. Laplace’s Theorie Analytique des Probabilités, 1812, is considered to be the greatest contribution by a single person to the theory of probability. In recent years, probability has been used extensively in many areas such as biology, economics, genetics, physics, sociology etc. Let us find the probability for some of the events associated with experiments where the equally likely assumption holds. Example 1 : Find the probability of getting a head when a coin is tossed once. Also find the probability of getting a tail. Solution : In the experiment of tossing a coin once, the number of possible outcomes is two — Head (H) and Tail (T). Let E be the event ‘getting a head’. The number of outcomes favourable to E, (i.e., of getting a head) is 1. Therefore, P(E) = P (head) = Number of outcomes favourable to E Number of all possible outcomes = 1 2 Similarly, if F is the event ‘getting a tail’, then P(F) = P(tail) = 1 2 (Why ?)

Before proceeding further, let us try to find the answers to the following questions: (i) What is the probability of getting a number 8 in a single throw of a die? (ii) What is the probability of getting a number less than 7 in a single throw of a die? Let us answer (i) : We know that there are only six possible outcomes in a single throw of a die. These outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Since no face of the die is marked 8, so there is no outcome favourable to 8, i.e., the number of such outcomes is zero.

Such an event is called an impossible event.

So, the number of favourable outcomes is the same as the number of all possible outcomes, which is 6. Therefore, P(E) = P(getting a number less than 7) = 6 6 = 1 So, the probability of an event which is sure (or certain) to occur is 1. Such an event is called a sure event or a certain event.

It is known that the probability of Sangeeta winning the match is 0.62. What is the probability of Reshma winning the match? Solution : Let S and R denote the events that Sangeeta wins the match and Reshma wins the match, respectively. The probability of Sangeeta’s winning = P(S) = 0.62 (given) The probability of Reshma’s winning = P(R) = 1 – P(S) [As the events R and S are complementary] = 1 – 0.62 = 0.38 Example 6 : Savita and Hamida are friends. What is the probability that both will have (i) different birthdays? (ii) the same birthday? (ignoring a leap year). Solution : Out of the two friends, one girl, say, Savita’s birthday can be any day of the year. Now, Hamida’s birthday can also be any day of 365 days in the year. We assume that these 365 outcomes are equally likely. (i) If Hamida’s birthday is different from Savita’s, the number of favourable outcomes for her birthday is 365 – 1 = 364 So, P (Hamida’s birthday is different from Savita’s birthday) = 364 365 (ii) P(Savita and Hamida have the same birthday) = 1 – P (both have different birthdays) = 364 1 365  [Using P( E ) = 1 – P(E)] = 1 365 Reprint 2025-26"}

Then she puts cards in a bag and stirs them thoroughly. She then draws one card from the bag. What is the probability that the name written on the card is the name of (i) a girl? (ii) a boy? Solution : There are 40 students, and only one name card has to be chosen.

What is the probability that she gets at least one head? Solution : We write H for ‘head’ and T for ‘tail’. When two coins are tossed simultaneously, the possible outcomes are (H, H), (H, T), (T, H), (T, T), which are all equally likely. Here (H, H) means head up on the first coin (say on ` 1) and head up on the second coin (` 2). Similarly (H, T) means head up on the first coin and tail up on the second coin and so on. The outcomes favourable to the event E, ‘at least one head’ are (H, H), (H, T) and (T, H). (Why?) So, the number of outcomes favourable to E is 3. Therefore, P(E) = 3 4 i.e., the probability that Harpreet gets at least one head is 3 4  Note : You can also find P(E) as follows: P (E) = 1 3 1 – P(E) = 1 – 4 4  1 Since P(E) = P(no head) = 4       Did you observe that in all the examples discussed so far, the number of possible outcomes in each experiment was finite? If not, check it now. There are many experiments in which the outcome is any number between two given numbers, or in which the outcome is every point within a circle or rectangle, etc. Can you now count the number of all possible outcomes? As you know, this is not possible since there are infinitely many numbers between two given numbers, or there are infinitely many points within a circle. So, the definition of (theoretical) probability which you have learnt so far cannot be applied in the present form. What is the way out? To answer this, let us consider the following example : Example 10* : In a musical chair game, the person playing the music has been advised to stop playing the music at any time within 2 minutes after she starts playing. What is the probability that the music will stop within the first half-minute after starting? Solution : Here the possible outcomes are all the numbers between 0 and 2.

As the number of trials in an experiment, go on increasing we may expect the experimental and theoretical probabilities to be nearly the same. 25. Which of the following arguments are correct and which are not correct? Give reasons for your answer. (i) If two coins are tossed simultaneously there are three possible outcomes—two heads, two tails or one of each. Therefore, for each of these outcomes, the probability is 1 3 (ii) If a die is thrown, there are two possible outcomes—an odd number or an even number. Therefore, the probability of getting an odd number is 1 2 . 14.2 Summary In this chapter, you have studied the following points : 1. The theoretical (classical) probability of an event E, written as P(E), is defined as P (E) = Number of outcomes favourable to E Number of all possible outcomes of the experiment where we assume that the outcomes of the experiment are equally likely. 2. The probability of a sure event (or certain event) is 1. 3. The probability of an impossible event is 0. 4. The probability of an event E is a number P(E) such that 0  P (E)  1 5. An event having only one outcome is called an elementary event. The sum of the probabilities of all the elementary events of an experiment is 1. 6. For any event E, P (E) + P ( E ) = 1, where E stands for ‘not E’. E and E are called complementary events. Reprint 2025-26"}
