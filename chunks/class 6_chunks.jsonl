{"id": "class 6__english c6__p3__c1", "text": "iii Foreword The National Education Policy 2020 envisages a system of education in the country that is rooted in Indian ethos and its civilisational accomplishments in all domains of human endeavour and knowledge, while at the same time preparing the students to constructively engage with the prospects and challenges of the 21st century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured the students’ inherent abilities touching upon all the five planes of human existence, the pañchakośhas, in the Foundational and the Preparatory Stages have paved the way for the progression of their learning further at the Middle Stage. Thus, the Middle Stage acts as a bridge between the Preparatory and the Secondary Stages, spanning three years from Grade 6 to Grade 8. The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive and narrative capabilities and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages—including at least two languages native to India—to Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy—a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 6__english c6__p4__c1", "text": "iviv Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. Poorvi, the English language textbook for Grade 6 is one of these. Its content comprises stories, poems and narratives that ensure a reflection of their social, cultural and geographical landscapes wherein they are sure to find traces of their lived experiences. Poorvi also weaves into its contents snippets from the vast treasure trove of Indian Knowledge Systems, India’s artistic and cultural heritage, and embeds values alongside ecological sensitivity, gender equality, digital skills, etc. For all practical purposes, it has, to my mind, succeeded in its curricular goals: first, to foster natural curiosity among students through a proper selection of content, and second, develop among them the core competencies in listening, speaking, reading and writing by intelligently designing various activities around them, thereby seamlessly integrating vocabulary and grammar within meaningful contexts. However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook, and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years.

{"id": "class 6__english c6__p5__c1", "text": "About the Book Poorvi, a textbook of English for Grade 6 is developed in alignment with the vision of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023. Language education is essential for effective communication, aesthetic expression and appreciation. Reasoning and critical thinking are very closely linked with language use, and these are valuable capacities to be developed. Language development plays an important role in the development of perceptual and practical concepts, and also enables us to check our experiences with others to ensure that we have a shared meaning emerging from these experiences. The textual material developed for the Middle Stage will take children well beyond the Preparatory Stage. Curricular Goals, competencies, and learning outcomes have been the guiding principles while developing the textbook. The Curricular Goals (CG) cover a range of competencies. CG-1: Student develops independent reading comprehension and summarising skills of a variety of texts (stories, poems, extracts of plays, essays, articles and news reports). CG-2: Attains the ability to write about thoughts, feelings and experiences of social events. CG-3: Develops the capacity for effective communication using language skills for questioning, describing, analysing and responding. CG-4: Explores different literary devices and forms of literature. CG-5: Develops the ability to recognise basic linguistic aspects (word and sentence structure) and use them in oral and written expression. CG-6: Develops appreciation the distinctive features of the language, including its alphabet and script, sounds, rhymes, puns, and other wordplays and games unique to the language. C-6.1: Understands the phonetics and script of the language, the number of vowels and consonants, and how they interact and are used. C-6.2: Engages in the use of puns, rhymes, alliteration, and other wordplays in the language to make speech and writing more interesting and enjoyable. Reprint 2025-26"}

There are five thematic units that comprise stories, poems, conversation, narrative and descriptive pieces. Themes such as friendship, wellness, sports, nature, art and culture, etc. have been included. Cross-cutting themes, such as Indian Knowledge Systems, values, heritage, gender sensitivity and inclusion have been integrated in all the units. Each unit has three literary pieces― story, poem, conversation, or non-fiction. There are intext questions, ‘Let us discuss’ to assess comprehension of the text. The end-of-the-text questions given in ‘Let us think and reflect’ are designed to encourage critical thinking, reasoning, responding, analysing, etc. Unit 1 ‘Fables and Folk Tales’ offers timeless wisdom through engaging narratives that resonate with young minds. It includes a classic fable as well as a folk tale from Tamil Nadu. The story, ‘A Bottle of Dew’ shows that true success comes from hard work and diligence. This story encourages students to value perseverance as a pathway to success. The poem, ‘The Raven and the Fox’ is a fable told in poetic form where students learn about the futility of vanity and flattery. ‘Rama to the Rescue’ is a graphic story that demonstrates the value of presence of mind in overcoming challenges. Unit 2 ‘Friendship’ will help students comprehend the meaning of ‘real friendship’ and that friendship has a huge impact on one’s well-being. The story ‘The Unlikely Best Friends’ is a narrative of a unique friendship that blossoms between Gajaraj, the elephant and Buntee, the dog. This story highlights the importance of empathy and how true friendship can bring joy and fulfillment, even in unexpected circumstances. ‘A Friend’s Prayer’ is a poem that reflects the significance of nurturing friendships. ‘The Chair’ is a story in which a grandfather helps Mario, his grandson, to distinguish between real and superficial friends. Unit 3 ‘Nurturing Nature’ is about the relationship between nature and human beings. The idea that nature has healing powers is inculcated among learners through the selected narratives.

Poorvi is an ancient and traditional Hindustani classical rāga that originated in eastern India. It is typically performed during the fourth prahar of the day, between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. It evokes a sense of calmness and contemplation in the journey of learners, symbolising a harmonious blend of traditional and modern learning.

He spent all his time to learn more about this potion. People cheated him often, promising to tell him about it, but he did not give up. His wife, Madhumati, was tired of this and also worried because she saw how much money Rama Natha was spending. She was sure that soon they would be without money. One day, a famous sage called Mahipati came to their town. Rama Natha became his follower and asked him about the potion. To his surprise the sage answered, “Yes, in my travels in the Himalayas, I heard how you could make such a potion. But it is difficult.” “Tell me!” requested Rama Natha, not believing his luck. “You have to plant a banana plant and water it regularly with your hands. In winter, the morning dew is on the leaves. You have to collect the dew and store it in a bottle. When you have five litres of dew, bring it to me. I will chant some magic words, which will turn it into the magic potion.

Wait here a minute.” Grandpa left, soon returning as though carrying something in his hand, but Mario could see nothing there. “Take it. It’s a very special chair.

Heeng can also help in controlling cough and cold. • Dalchini (cinnamon) and laung (clove) give relief when we have toothache till we can consult a dentist. • Adrak (ginger) is another herb that can help us when we have cough and cold.

The fact was that he could not bear losing, not even at marbles. He felt so good when he won that he never wanted to give up that feeling. On the contrary, losing made him feel terrible. He thought that losing was the worst thing that could happen to anyone. If Prabhat sensed that he would lose a game, he would not play it. He would take part only when he was sure of winning, even if the game lasted only for a minute. You could not stop him from playing the kind of games he was really good at, like badminton. A new student joined Prabhat’s school, and his name was Surya. Surya was an excellent badminton player. Prabhat waited for the last Friday of the month. Last Friday was significant. This was when the coach conducted friendly matches in the games period. The teams were decided on Monday and it was no surprise when Prabhat and Surya were chosen to play a round against each other. Prabhat was given the responsibility of keeping score for their match. On one hand, Prabhat prepared for the match with great seriousness. Surya, on the other hand, seemed relaxed, not taking the things seriously at all.

As Prabhat went on with his observation, he realised that to enjoy a game, you did not need a scoreboard to keep a tally of your scores. Neither did you have to worry about winning nor losing. You needed to enjoy the game for its own sake. What matters is trying to do well, and enjoying every moment of it. Prabhat learnt something through the observations every day, soon realising the change in himself. He had even begun playing hide and seek, and felt sad whenever it was about to end.

This symbolises the unity of mind and body; thought and action; harmony between human and nature. It is a holistic approach to health and well-being. Sage Patanjali presented the ancient tradition of yoga in a systematic way in ‘Yoga Sutras of Patanjali’. He described yoga as the means to make the mind quiet and free from all distractions.

We must remember that when we practise yoga asanas (postures), we do not just stretch the body. The mind has to be with the body. This is the reason why it should be practised without distractions.

Let me tell you a unique dish of my district. It is called gakkad bharta. First, we make gakkad from wheat dough. Then, we make balls with that dough and roast them on high heat. To make bharta, we roast brinjals and tomatoes. Then we garnish the bharta with chopped onions, coriander, green chillis and salt. This food item is made without frying. To eat it, you simply crumble the gakkad and drizzle it with some bharta and a spoonful of ghee. Come to Jabalpur and try it! You will listen to the audio or narration once again.

It is a popular festival in India and it takes place during Makar Sankranti in the month of January. People can even be seen flying kites from their terraces and rooftops and taking part in kite flying competitions. This festival is celebrated as Uttarayan in Western India. The festival gives everyone a chance to look at kites of different shapes, sizes and colours. Gujarat is the main centre of celebrations but Uttarayan is also celebrated in Rajasthan and Telangana. In Karnataka, the Tourism Department has also been organising the Kite Festival once each year. Punjab also celebrates this festival of kites during Baisakhi and Basant Panchami. Kite flying is a tradition that is deep-rooted in Indian culture and the Kite Festival is one that is eagerly awaited.

It uses many bright colours and also uses many types of stitches, like the chain stitch. The embroidery is commonly seen on clothes and home decoration items. On clothes, it is seen on children’s caps, ghagra skirts and men’s traditional shirts. In this embroidery, a lot of mirror work is done by fitting small mirrors along with the stitches. Most commonly, the designs used are geometric shapes like squares and triangles. The design of flowers is also used. There is much more to share but I’ll do that some other time. Thank you!

Mathematics is, in large part, the search for patterns, and for the explanations as to why those patterns exist. Such patterns indeed exist all around us — in nature, in our homes and schools, and in the motion of the sun, moon, and stars. They occur in everything that we do and see, from shopping and cooking, to throwing a ball and playing games, to understanding weather patterns and using technology. The search for patterns and their explanations can be a fun and creative endeavour. It is for this reason that mathematicians think of mathematics both as an art and as a science. This year, we hope that you will get a chance to see the creativity and artistry involved in discovering and understanding mathematical patterns. It is important to keep in mind that mathematics aims to not just find out what patterns exist, but also the explanations for why they exist. Such explanations can often then be used in applications well beyond the context in which they were discovered, which can then help to propel humanity forward. Reprint 2025-26"}

Figure it Out 1. Can you think of other examples where mathematics helps us in our everyday lives? 2. How has mathematics helped propel humanity forward? (You might think of examples involving: carrying out scientific experiments; running our economy and democracy; building bridges, houses or other complex structures; making TVs, mobile phones, computers, bicycles, trains, cars, planes, calendars, clocks, etc.) 1.2 Patterns in Numbers Among the most basic patterns that occur in mathematics are patterns of numbers, particularly patterns of whole numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... The branch of Mathematics that studies patterns in whole numbers is called number theory. Number sequences are the most basic and among the most fascinating types of patterns that mathematicians study. Table 1 shows some key number sequences that are studied in Mathematics.

Example: What happens when we start adding up odd numbers? 1 = 1 1 + 3 = 4 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 = 36 ... This is a really beautiful pattern! Why does this happen? Do you think it will happen forever? The answer is that the pattern does happen forever. But why? As mentioned earlier, the reason why the pattern happens is just as important and exciting as the pattern itself. A picture can explain it Visualising with a picture can help explain the phenomenon. Recall that square numbers are made by counting the number of dots in a square grid. How can we partition the dots in a square grid into odd numbers of dots: 1, 3, 5, 7,... ?

Because such a picture can be made for a square of any size, this explains why adding up odd numbers gives square numbers. By drawing a similar picture, can you say what is the sum of the first 10 odd numbers? Now by imagining a similar picture, or by drawing it partially, as needed, can you say what is the sum of the first 100 odd numbers?

These shapes may be in one, two, or three dimensions (1D, 2D, or 3D) — or in even more dimensions. The branch of Mathematics that studies patterns in shapes is called geometry. Shape sequences are one important type of shape pattern that mathematicians study. Table 3 shows a few key shape sequences that are studied in Mathematics. Reprint 2025-26"}

Such relationships can be helpful in studying and understanding both the shape sequence and the related number sequence. Example: The number of sides in the shape sequence of Regular Polygons is given by the counting numbers starting at 3, i.e., 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, .... That is why these shapes are called, respectively, regular triangle, quadrilateral (i.e., square), pentagon, hexagon, heptagon, octagon, nonagon, decagon, etc., respectively. The word ‘regular’ refers to the fact that these shapes have equal-length sides and also equal ‘angles’ (i.e., the sides look the same and the corners also look the same). We will discuss angles in more depth in the next chapter. The other shape sequences in Table 3 also have beautiful relationships with number sequences. Figure it Out 1.

S u m m a r y Mathematics may be viewed as the search for patterns and for the explanations as to why those patterns exist. Among the most basic patterns that occur in mathematics are number sequences. Some important examples of number sequences include the counting numbers, odd numbers, even numbers, square numbers, triangular numbers, cube numbers, Virahānka numbers, and powers of 2. Sometimes number sequences can be related to each other in beautiful and remarkable ways. For example, adding up the sequence of odd numbers starting with 1 gives square numbers. Visualising number sequences using pictures can help to understand sequences and the relationships between them. Shape sequences are another basic type of pattern in mathematics. Some important examples of shape sequences include regular polygons, complete graphs, stacked triangles and squares, and Koch snowflake iterations. Shape sequences also exhibit many interesting relationships with number sequences. Try This Reprint 2025-26"}

Here is an angle formed by rays BD and BE where B is the common starting point (Fig. 2.8). The point B is called the vertex of the angle, and the rays BD and BE are called the arms of the angle. How can we name this angle? We can simply use the vertex and say that it is the Angle B. To be clearer, we use a point on each of the arms together with the vertex to name the angle. In this case, we name the angle as Angle DBE or Angle EBD. The word angle can be replaced by the symbol ‘∠’, i.e., ∠DBE or ∠EBD. Note that in specifying the angle, the vertex is always written as the middle letter. To indicate an angle, we use a small curve at the vertex (refer to Fig. 2.9). Vidya has just opened her book.

Similarly, the angle in Case 3 is even larger than that of Case 2, because there is even more rotation, and Cases 4, 5, and 6 are successively larger angles with more and more rotation.

The Rigveda, one of the very oldest texts of humanity going back thousands of years, speaks of a wheel with 360 spokes (Verse 1.164.48). Many ancient calendars, also going back over 3000 years—such as calendars of India, Persia, Babylonia and Egypt—were based on having 360 days in a year. In addition, Babylonian mathematicians frequently used divisions of 60 and 360 due to their use of sexagesimal numbers and counting by 60s. Perhaps the most important and practical answer for why mathematicians over the years have liked and continued to use 360 degrees is that 360 is the smallest number that can be evenly divided by all numbers up to 10, aside from 7. Thus, one can break up the circle into 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 equal parts, and still have a whole number of degrees in each part! Note that 360 is also evenly divisible by 12, the number of months in a year, and by 24, the number of hours in a day. These facts all make the number 360 very useful.

A line segment corresponds to the shortest distance between two points. The line segment joining points S and T is denoted by ST. A line is obtained when a line segment like ST is extended on both sides indefinitely; it is denoted by ST or sometimes by a single small letter like m. A ray is a portion of a line starting at a point D and going in one direction indefinitely. It is denoted by DP where P is another point on the ray. An angle can be visualised as two rays starting from a common starting point. Two rays OP and OM form the angle ∠POM (also called ∠MOP); here, O is called the vertex of the angle, and the rays OP and OM are called the arms of the angle. The size of an angle is the amount of rotation or turn needed about the vertex to rotate one ray of the angle onto the other ray of the angle. The sizes of angles can be measured in degrees. One full rotation or turn is considered as 360 degrees and denoted as 360°. Degree measures of angles can be measured using a protractor. Angles can be straight (180°), right (90°), acute (more than 0° and less than 90°), obtuse (more than 90° and less than 180°), and reflex (more than 180° and less than 360°). Reprint 2025-26"}

Notice that all four sequences above eventually reached the number 1. In 1937, the German mathematician, Lothar Collatz conjectured that the sequence will always reach 1, regardless of the whole number you start with. Even today — despite many mathematicians working on it — it remains an unsolved problem as to whether Collatz’s conjecture is true! Collatz’s conjecture is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. Make some more Collatz sequences like those above, starting with your favourite whole numbers. Do you always reach 1? Do you believe the conjecture of Collatz that all such sequences will eventually reach 1?

For example, your school headmaster might know the exact number of students enrolled in your school, but you may only know an estimated count. How many students are in your school? About 150? 400? A thousand? Paromita’s class section has 32 children. The other 2 sections of her class have 29 and 35 children. So, she estimated the number of children in her class to be about 100. Along with Class 6, her school also has Classes 7–10 and each class has 3 sections each. She assumed a similar number in each class and estimated the number of students in her school to be around 500. Figure it Out \u0007We shall do some simple estimates.

One unit of length stands for 100 vehicles. 100 600 200 700 300 800 400 900 1100 500 1000 1200 Time intervals Number of vehicles 11–12 10–11 9–10 8–9 7–8 6–7 We can see that the maximum traffic at the crossing is shown by the longest bar, i.e., for the time interval 7–8 a.m. The bar graph shows that 1200 vehicles passed through the crossing at that time. The second longest bar is for 8–9 a.m. During that time, 1000 vehicles passed through the crossing. Similarly, the minimum traffic is shown by the smallest bar, i.e., the bar for the time interval 6–7 a.m. During that time, only about 150 vehicles passed through the crossing. The second smallest bar is that for the time interval 11 a.m.–12 noon, when about 600 vehicles passed through the crossing. The total number of cars passing through the crossing during the two-hour interval 8.00–10.00 a.m. as shown by the bar graph is about 1000 + 800 = 1800 vehicles. Reprint 2025-26"}

Let’s try to prepare a bar graph to present his data — 1. \u0007First, we draw a horizontal line and a vertical line. On the horizontal line, we will write the name of each of the sweets, equally spaced, from which the bars will rise in accordance with their frequencies; and on the vertical line we will write the frequencies representing the number of students. 2. We must choose a scale. That means we must decide how many students will be represented by a unit length of a bar so that it fits nicely on our paper. Here, we will take 1 unit length to represent 1 student. 3. For jalebi, we therefore need to draw a bar having a height of 6 units (which is the frequency of the sweet jalebi), and similarly for the other sweets we have to draw bars as high as their frequencies.

Using a scale of 1 unit length = l run would mean that we have to go all the way from 0 to 100 runs in steps of l. This would be unnecessarily tedious. Instead, let us use a scale where 1 unit length = 10 runs. We mark this scale on the vertical line and draw the bars according to the scores in each match.

First, when making a visual presentation of data such as a pictograph or bar graph, it is important to make it fit in the intended space; this can be controlled, for example, by choosing the scale appropriately, as we have seen earlier. It is also desirable to make the data presentation visually appealing and easy-to-understand, so that the intended audience appreciates the information being conveyed. Let us consider an example. Here is a table naming the tallest mountain on each continent, along with the height of each mountain in meters. Continent Asia South America North America Africa Europe Antarctica Australia Tallest Mountain Everest Aconcagua Denali Kiliman- jaro Elbrus Vinson Massif Koscuiszko Height 8848m 6962m 6194m 5895m 5642m 4892m 2228m How much taller is Mount Everest than Mount Koscuiszko? Are Mount Denali and Mount Kilimanjaro very different in height? This is not so easy to quickly discern from a large table of numbers. As we have seen earlier, we can convert the table of numbers into a bar graph, as shown on the right. Here, each value is drawn as a horizontal box. These are longer or shorter depending on the number they represent. This makes it easier to compare the heights of all these mountains at a glance. Reprint 2025-26"}

A bar graph with vertical bars is also called a column graph. Columns are the pillars you find in a building that hold up the roof. Below is a column graph for our table of tallest mountains. From this column graph, it becomes easier to compare and visualise the heights of the mountains. 0 10000 9000 8000 7000 6000 5000 4000 3000 2000 1000 Asia Everest South America Aconcagua North America Denali Africa Kilimanjaro Europe Elbrus Antarctica Vinson Massif Australia Koscuiszko Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 6__maths c6__p132__c1", "text": "Data Handling and Presentation 103 In general, it is more intuitive, suggestive and visually appealing to represent heights, that are measured upwards from the ground, using bar graphs that have vertical bars or columns. Similarly, lengths that are parallel to the ground (for example, distances between location on Earth) are usually best represented using bar graphs with horizontal arcs. Figure it Out 1. If you wanted to visually represent the data of the heights of the tallest persons in each class in your school, would you use a graph with vertical bars or horizontal bars?

Try finding out this information, and then make the corresponding table and bar graph! Which continents have the longest rivers? Infographics When data visualisations such as bar graphs are further beautified with more extensive artistic and visual imagery, they are called information graphics or infographics for short. The aim of infographics is to make use of attention-attracting and engaging visuals to communicate information even more clearly and quickly, in a visually pleasing way. As an example of how infographics can be used to communicate data even more suggestively, let us go back to the table above listing the tallest mountain on each continent. We drew a bar graph with vertical bars (columns) rather than horizontal bars, to be more indicative of mountains. But instead of rectangles, we could use triangles, which look a bit more like mountains. And, we can add a splash of colour as well. Here is the result. Reprint 2025-26"}

The goal of our bar graph earlier was to represent the heights of various mountains — using bars of the appropriate heights but the same widths. The purpose of using the same widths was to make it clear that we are only comparing heights. However, in this infographic, the taller triangles are also wider! Are taller mountains always wider? The infographic is implying additional information that may be misleading and may or may not be correct. Sometimes going for more appealing pictures can also accidentally mislead. Taking this idea further, and to make the picture even more visually stimulating and suggestive, we can further change the shapes of the mountains to make them look even more like mountains, and add other details, while attempting to preserve the heights. For example, we can create an imaginary mountain range that contains all these mountains. Is the infographic below better than the column graph with rectangular columns of equal width? The mountains look more realistic, but is the picture accurate? For example, Everest appears to be twice as tall as Elbrus. Reprint 2025-26"}

Bar graphs have bars of uniform width; the length or height that indicates the total frequency of occurrence. The scale that is used to convert length or height to frequency again, must be specified. Choosing the appropriate scale for a pictograph or bar graph is important to accurately and effectively convey the desired information or data and to also make it visually appealing. Other aspects of a graph also contribute to its effectiveness and visual appeal such as how colours are used, what accompanying pictures are drawn, and whether the bars are horizontal or vertical. These aspects correspond to the artistic and aesthetic side of data handling and presentation. However, making visual representations of data ‘fancy’ can also sometimes be misleading.

Guna can arrange 12 figs in a rectangular manner. 2. Anshu can arrange 7 figs in a rectangular manner. Guna has listed out these possibilities. Observe the number of rows and columns in each of the arrangements. How are they related to 12? In the second arrangement, for example, 12 figs are arranged in two columns of 6 each or 12 = 2 × 6. Anshu could make only one arrangement: 7 × 1 or 1 × 7. There are no other rectangular arrangements possible. In each of Guna’s arrangements, multiplying the number of rows by the number of columns gives the number 12. So, the number of rows or columns are factors of 12. We saw that the number 12 can be arranged in a rectangle in more than one way as 12 has more than two factors. The number 7 can be arranged in only one way, as it has only two factors — 1 and 7.

Just follow the steps given below and see what happens. Step 1: Cross out 1 because it is neither prime nor composite. Step 2: Circle 2, and then cross out all multiples of 2 after that, i.e., 4, 6, 8, and so on. Step 3: You will find that the next uncrossed number is 3.

Anshu and Guna: \u0007If they have a common factor other than 1, then they are not co-prime. Let us check. Anshu: \u0007I can write 56 = 14 × 4 and 63 = 21 × 3. So, 14 and 4 are factors, of 56. Further, 21 and 3 are factors of 63. So, there are no common factors. The numbers are co-prime. Guna: \u0007Hold on. I can also write 56 = 7 × 8 and 63 = 9 × 7. We see that 7 is a factor of both numbers, so, they are not co-prime. Clearly Guna is right, as 7 is a common factor. But where did Anshu go wrong? Writing 56 = 14 × 4 tells us that 14 and 4 are both factors of 56, but it does not tell all the factors of 56. The same holds for the factors of 63. Try another example: 80 and 63. There are many ways to factorise both numbers. 80 = 40 × 2 = 20 × 4 = 10 × 8 = 16 × 5 = ??? 63 = 9 × 7 = 3 × 21 = ??? We have written ‘???’ to say that there may be more ways to factorise these numbers. But if we take any of the given factorisations, for example, 80 = 16 × 5 and 63 = 9 × 7, then there are no common factors. Can we conclude that 80 and 63 are co-prime? As Anshu’s mistake above shows, we cannot conclude that as there may be other ways to factorise the numbers. What this means is that we need a more systematic approach to check if two numbers are co-prime. Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 6__maths c6__p158__c1", "text": "Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 118 Prime factorisation Take a number such as 56. It is composite, as we saw that it can be written as 56 = 4 × 14 . So, both 4 and 14 are factors of 56. Now take one of these, say 14. It is also composite and can be written as 14 = 2 × 7. Therefore, 56 = 4 × 2 × 7. Now, 4 is composite and can be written as 4 = 2 × 2. Therefore, 56 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 7. All the factors appearing here, 2 and 7, are prime numbers. So, we cannot divide them further. In conclusion, we have written 56 as a product of prime numbers. This is called prime factorisation of 56. The individual factors are called prime factors. For example, the prime factors of 56 are 2 and 7. Every number greater than 1 has a prime factorisation. The idea is the same: keep breaking the composite numbers into factors till only primes are left. The number 1 does not have any prime factorisation. It is not divisible by any prime number. What is the prime factorisation of a prime number like 7? It is just 7 (we cannot break it down any further). Let us see a few more examples. By going through different ways of breaking down the number, we wrote 63 as 3 × 3 × 7 and as 3 × 7 × 3. Are they different? Not really! The same prime numbers 3 and 7 occur in both cases. Further, 3 appears two times in both and 7 appears once. Here, you see four different ways to get prime factorisation of 36. Observe that in all four cases, we get two 2s and two 3s. Multiply back to see that you get 36 in all four cases. For any number, it is a remarkable fact that there is only one prime factorisation, except that the prime factors may come in different 36 2×18 3×12 4×9 6×6 2×2×9 3×3×4 2×2×9 2×3×6 2×2×3×3 3×3×2×2 2×2×3×3 2×3×2×3 2×3×2×3 2×2×3×3 Reprint 2025-26"}

However, as we saw in these examples, there are many ways to arrive at the prime factorisation! Does the order matter? Using this diagram, can you explain why 30 = 2 × 3 × 5, no matter which way you multiply 2, 3, and 5? When multiplying numbers, we can do so in any order. The end result is the same. That is why, when two 2s and two 3s are multiplied in any order, we get 36. In a later class, we shall study this under the names of commutativity and associativity of multiplication. Thus, the order does not matter. Usually we write the prime numbers in increasing order. For example, 225 = 3 × 3 × 5 × 5 or 30 = 2 × 3 × 5. Prime factorisation of a product of two numbers When we find the prime factorisation of a number, we first write it as a product of two factors. For example, 72 = 12 × 6. Then, we find the prime factorisation of each of the factors. In the above example, 12 = 2 × 2 × 3 and 6 = 2 × 3. Now, can you say what the prime factorisation of 72 is?

What is the smallest number whose prime factorisation has: a. three different prime numbers? b. four different prime numbers? Prime factorisation is of fundamental importance in the study of numbers. Let us discuss two ways in which it can be useful. Using prime factorisation to check if two numbers are co-prime \u0007Let us again take the numbers 56 and 63. How can we check if they are co-prime? We can use the prime factorisation of both numbers — 56 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 7 and 63 = 3 × 3 × 7 Now, we see that 7 is a prime factor of 56 as well as 63. Therefore, 56 and 63 are not co-prime. What about 80 and 63? Their prime factorisations are as follows: 80 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 and 63 = 3 × 3 × 7 There are no common prime factors. Can we conclude that they are co-prime? Suppose they have a common factor that is composite. Would the prime factors of this composite common factor appear in the prime factorisation of 80 and 63? Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 6__maths c6__p161__c1", "text": "Prime Time 121 Therefore, we can say that if there are no common prime factors, then the two numbers are co-prime. Let us see some examples. Example: \u0007Consider 40 and 231. Their prime factorisations are as follows: 40 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 and 231 = 3 × 7 × 11 We see that there are no common primes that divide both 40 and 231. Indeed, the prime factors of 40 are 2 and 5 while, the prime factors of 231 are 3, 7, and 11. Therefore, 40 and 231 are co-prime! Example: \u0007Consider 242 and 195. Their prime factorisations are as follows: 242 = 2 × 11 × 11 and 195 = 3 × 5 × 13 The prime factors of 242 are 2 and 11. The prime factors of 195 are 3, 5, and 13. There are no common prime factors. Therefore, 242 and 195 are co-prime. Using prime factorisation to check if one number is divisible by another We can say that if one number is divisible by another, the prime factorisation of the second number is included in the prime factorisation of the first number. We say that 48 is divisible by 12 because when we divide 48 by 12, the remainder is zero. How can we check if one number is divisible by another without carrying out long division? Example: Is 168 divisible by 12? Find the prime factorisations of both: 168 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 7 and 12 = 2 × 2 × 3 Since we can multiply in any order, now it is clear that, 168 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 2 × 7 = 12 × 14 Therefore, 168 is divisible by 12.

However, 7 is a prime factor of 21 but not a prime factor of 75. Therefore, 75 is not divisible by 21. Example: Is 42 divisible by 12? Find the prime factorisations of both: 42 = 2 × 3 × 7 and 12 = 2 × 2 × 3 All prime factors of 12 are also prime factors of 42. But the prime factorisation of 12 is not included in the prime factorisation of 42. This is because 2 occurs twice in the prime factorisation of 12 but only once in the prime factorisation of 42. This means that 42 is not divisible by 12.

Similarly 14 and 24 have the same last digit, but 14 is not a multiple of 4 while 24 is. Similarly, 16 and 26 or 18 and 28.

For example, 4 is a factor of 12 because 12 is divisible by 4 (12 ÷ 4 = 3). Prime numbers are numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, … that have only two factors, namely 1 and themselves. Composite numbers are numbers like 4, 6, 8, 9, … that have more than 2 factors, i.e., at least one factor other than 1 and themselves. For example, 8 has the factor 4 and 9 has the factor 3, so 8 and 9 are both composite. Every number greater than 1 can be written as a product of prime numbers. This is called the number’s prime factorisation. For example, 84 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 7. There is only one way to factorise a number into primes, except for the ordering of the factors. Two numbers that do not have a common factor other than 1 are said to be co-prime. To check if two numbers are co-prime, we can first find their prime factorisations and check if there is a common prime factor. If there is no common prime factor, they are co-prime, and otherwise they are not. A number is a factor of another number if the prime factorisation of the first number is included in the prime factorisation of the second number. Reprint 2025-26"}

{"id": "class 6__maths c6__p180__c1", "text": "6.1 Perimeter Do you remember what the perimeter of a closed plane figure is? Let us refresh our understanding! The perimeter of any closed plane figure is the distance covered along its boundary when you go around it once. For a polygon, i.e., a closed plane figure made up of line segments, the perimeter is simply the sum of the lengths of its all sides, i.e., the total distance along its outer boundary. The perimeter of a polygon = the sum of the lengths of its all sides. Let us revise the formulas for the perimeter of rectangles, squares, and triangles. Perimeter of a rectangle Consider a rectangle ABCD whose length and breadth are 12 cm and 8 cm, respectively. What is its perimeter?

From this example, we see that — Perimeter of a rectangle = length + breadth + length + breadth. Perimeter of a rectangle = 2 × (length + breadth). \u0007The perimeter of a rectangle is twice the sum of its length and breadth. Perimeter of a square Debojeet wants to put coloured tape all around a square photo frame of side 1m as shown. What will be the length of the coloured tape he requires? Since Debojeet wants to put the coloured tape all around the square photo frame, he needs to find the perimeter of the photo frame. Thus, the length of the tape required = perimeter of the square = sum of the lengths of all four sides of the square = 1 m + 1 m + 1 m + 1 m = 4 m. Now, we know that all four sides of a square are equal in length. Therefore, in place of adding the lengths of each side, we can simply multiply the length of one side by 4. \u0007Thus, the length of the tape required = 4 × 1 m = 4 m. From this example, we see that Perimeter of a square = 4 × length of a side. The perimeter of a square is quadruple the length of its side. Opposite sides of a rectangle are always equal.

Example: Akshi wants to put lace all around a rectangular tablecloth that is 3 m long and 2 m wide. Find the length of the lace required. Solution Length of the rectangular table cover = 3 m. Breadth of the rectangular table cover = 2 m. Akshi wants to put lace all around the tablecloth. Therefore, the length of the lace required will be the perimeter of the rectangular tablecloth. Now, the perimeter of the rectangular tablecloth = 2 × (length + breadth) = 2 × (3 m + 2 m) = 2 × 5 m = 10 m. Hence, the length of the lace required is 10 m.

Area of a square = ________ Area of a rectangle = _______ Teacher’s Note Help students in recalling the method of finding the area of a rectangle and a square using grid papers. Provide square grid papers to students and let them come up with the formula. Let’s see some real-life problems related to these ideas. Example: A floor is 5 m long and 4 m wide. A square carpet of sides 3 m is laid on the floor. Find the area of the floor that is not carpeted. Solution Length of the floor = 5 m. Width of the floor = 4 m. Area of the floor = length × width = 5 m × 4 m = 20 sq m. Length of the square carpet = 3 m. Area of the carpet = length × length = 3 m × 3 m = 9 sq m. Hence, the area of the floor laid with carpet is 9 sq m. Therefore, the area of the floor that is not carpeted is: area of the floor minus the area of the floor laid with carpet = 20 sq m – 9 sq m = 11 sq m.

In other words, a fraction is said to be in lowest terms if its numerator and denominator are as small as possible. Any fraction can be expressed in lowest terms by finding an equivalent fraction whose numerator and denominator are as small as possible. Let’s see how to express fractions in lowest terms. Example: Is the fraction 16 20 in lowest terms? No, 4 is a common factor of 16 and 20. Let us reduce 16 20 to lowest terms. We know that both 16 (numerator) and 20 (denominator) are divisible by 4. So, 16 ÷ 4 20 ÷ 4 = 4 5. Now, there is no common factor between 4 and 5. Hence, 16 20 expressed in lowest terms is 4 5. So, 4 5 is called the simplest form of 16 20, since 4 and 5 have no common factor other than 1.

Both the numerator and denominator are even again, so we can divide them each by 2 again; we get 18 30 = 9 15. We now notice that 9 and 15 are both multiples of 3, so we divide both by 3 to get 9 15 = 3 5 . Now, 3 and 5 have no common factor other than 1, so, 36 60 in lowest terms is 3 5. Alternatively, we could have noticed that in 36 60 , both the numerator and denominator are multiples of 12 : we see that 36 = 3 × 12 and 60 = 5 × 12.

In ancient Indian mathematical texts, such as the Bakshali manuscript (from around the year 300 CE), when they wanted to write 1 2, they wrote it as 1 2 which is indeed very similar to the way we write it today! This method of writing and working with fractions continued to be used in India for the next several centuries, including by Aryabhata (499 CE), Brahmagupta (628 CE), Sridharacharya (c. 750 CE), and Mahaviracharya (c. 850 CE), among others.

Over the next few centuries the notation then spread to Europe and around the world. Fractions had also been used in other cultures such as the ancient Egyptian and Babylonian civilisations, but they primarily used only fractional units, that is, fractions with a 1 in the numerator. More general fractions were expressed as sums of fractional units, now called ‘Egyptian fractions’. Writing numbers as the sum of fractional units, e.g., 19 24 = 1 2 + 1 6 + 1 8, can be quite an art and leads to beautiful puzzles. We will consider one such puzzle below. General fractions (where the numerator is not necessarily 1) were first introduced in India, along with their rules of arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and even division of fractions. The ancient Indian treatises called the ‘Sulba- sutras’ shows that even during Vedic times, Indians had discovered the rules for operations with fractions. General rules and procedures for working with and computing with fractions were first codified formally and in a modern form by Brahmagupta. Brahmagupta’s methods for working with and computing with fractions are still what we use today. For example, Brahmagupta described how to add and subtract fractions as follows: “By the multiplication of the numerator and the denominator of each of the fractions by the other denominators, the fractions are reduced to a common denominator. Then, in case of addition, the numerators (obtained after the above reduction) are added. In case of subtraction, their difference is taken.’’ (Brahmagupta, Brahmasphuṭasiddhānta, Verse 12.2, 628 CE) The Indian concepts and methods involving fractions were transmitted to Europe via the Arabs over the next few centuries and they came into general use in Europe in around the 17th century and then spread worldwide.

The reason is that 1 2 is the largest fractional unit, and 1 2 + 1 2 = 1. \u0007 To get different fractional units, we would have to replace at least one of the 1 2’s with some smaller fractional unit - but then the sum would be less than 1! Therefore, it is not possible for two different fractional units to add up to 1. \u0007 We can try to look instead for a way to write 1 as the sum of three different fractional units. 1. \u0007Can you find three different fractional units that add up to 1? \u0007It turns out there is only one solution to this problem (up to changing the order of the 3 fractions)! Can you find it? Try to find it before reading further. Here is a systematic way to find the solution. We know that 1 3 + 1 3 + 1 3 = 1. To get the fractional units to be different, we will have to increase at least one of the 1 3’s, and decrease at least one of the other 1 3’s to compensate for that increase. The only way to increase 1 3 to another fractional unit is to replace it by 1 2. So 1 2 must be one of the fractional units. Now 1 2 + 1 4 + 1 4 = 1. To get the fractional units to be different, we will have to increase one of the 1 4’s and decrease the other 1 4 to compensate for that increase.

Fractional Units: When one whole basic unit is divided into equal parts, then each part is called a fractional unit. Reading Fractions: In a fraction such as 5 6, 5 is called the numerator and 6 is called the denominator. Mixed fractions contain a whole number part and a fractional part. Number line: Fractions can be shown on a number line. Every fraction has a point associated with it on the number line. Equivalent Fractions: When two or more fractions represent the same share or number, they are called equivalent fractions. Lowest terms: A fraction whose numerator and denominator have no common factor other than 1 is said to be in lowest terms or in its simplest form. Brahmagupta’s method for adding fractions: When adding fractions, convert them into equivalent fractions with the same fractional unit (i.e., the same denominator), and then add the number of fractional units in each fraction to obtain the sum.

What do you observe? Reflection So far we have been saying that when we fold a figure along a line of symmetry, the two parts overlap completely. We could also say that the part of the figure on one side of the line of symmetry is reflected by the line to the other side; similarly, the part of the figure on the other side of the line of symmetry is reflected to the first side!

However, if you fold it, the two halves will not exactly overlap. On the other hand, if you rotate it by 90° about the red point at the centre, the windmill looks exactly the same. We say that the windmill has rotational symmetry. When talking of rotational symmetry, there is always a fixed point about which the object is rotated. This fixed point is called the centre of rotation. Will the windmill above look exactly the same when rotated through an angle of less than 90°? No! An angle through which a figure can be rotated to look exactly the same is called an angle of rotational symmetry, or just an angle of symmetry, for short. Reprint 2025-26"}

Phrased another way, we have seen the number line: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 However, this is actually only a number ‘ray’, in the language we learned earlier in geometry; this ray starts at 0 and goes forever to the right. Do there exist numbers to the left of 0, so that this number ray can be completed to a true number line? That is what we will investigate in this chapter! Reprint 2025-26"}

To make it even more fun for them, Bela purchased a multi- storied building and filled it with attractions. She named it Bela’s Building of Fun. But this was no ordinary building! Observe that some of the floors in the ‘Building of Fun’ are below the ground. What are the shops that you find on these floors? What is there on the ground floor? A lift is used to go up and down between the floors. It has two buttons: ‘+’ to go up and ‘–’ to go down. Can you spot the lift? To go to the Art Centre from the ‘Welcome Hall’, you must press the ‘+’ button twice. We say that the button press is + + or + 2. To go down two floors, you must press the ‘–’ button twice, which we write as – – or – 2. So if you press + 1 (i.e., if you press the ‘+’ button once), then you will go up one floor and if you press – 1 (i.e., if you press the ‘–’ button once), then you will go down 1 floor.

For example, consider this situation: I have `10 with me and my sister has `6. Now, I can ask the question: ʻHow much more money should my sister get in order to have the same amount as me?ʼ We can write this in two ways: 6 + ? = 10 Or 10 – 6 = ?

For subtraction of positive and negative numbers, we will use this meaning of subtraction as ‘making equal’ or ‘finding the missing number to be added’. \u0007Evaluate 15 – 5, 100 – 10 and 74 – 34 from this perspective. In general, when there are two unequal quantities, subtraction can indicate the change needed to make the quantities equal. Subtraction shows how much the starting quantity should change in order to become the target quantity. In the context of different floor levels, what is the change required to reach the Target Floor from the Starting Floor? Notice that the change needed may be positive (for an increase) or negative (for a decrease). Teacher’s Note Your starting floor is the Art Centre and your target floor is the Sports Centre.

Some of the levels are marked in the picture. The ground level is marked 0. Levels above the ground are marked by positive numbers and levels below the ground are marked by negative numbers.

Adding, subtracting, and comparing any numbers To add and subtract even larger integers, we can imagine even larger lifts! In fact, we can imagine a lift that can extend forever upwards and forever downwards, starting from Level 0. There does not even have to be any building or mine around — just an ‘infinite lift’! We can use this imagination to add and subtract any integers we like. For example, suppose we want to carry out the subtraction + 2000 – (– 200). We can imagine a lift with 2000 levels above the ground and 200 below the ground. Recall that, Target Level – Starting Level = Movement needed To go from the Starting Floor – 200 to the Target Floor + 2000, we must press + 2200 (+ 200 to get to zero, and then + 2000 more after that to get to + 2200).

In the other exercises that you did above, did you notice that subtracting a negative number was the same as adding the corresponding positive number? Take a look at the ‘infinite lift’ above. Does it remind you of a number line? In what ways? Back to the number line The ‘infinite lift’ we saw above looked very much like a number line, didn’t it? In fact, if we rotate it by 90°, it basically becomes a number line. It also tells us how to complete the number ray to a number line, answering the question that we had asked at the beginning of the chapter.

Other numbers are not marked. It can be convenient to use this unmarked number line to add and subtract integers. You can show, or simply imagine, the scale of the number line and the positions of numbers on it. For example, this unmarked number line (UNL) shows the addition problem: 85 + (– 60) = ? +85 +25 – 60 0 We then can visualise that 85 + (– 60) = 25 The following UNL shows a subtraction problem which can also be written as a missing addend problem: (– 100) – (+ 250) = ? or 250 + ? = – 100. + 250 – 100 0 ?

In this way, we can always convert subtraction to addition. The number that is being subtracted can be replaced by its inverse and then added instead.

To entertain himself, he keeps a box containing lots of positive (red) and negative (green) tokens. Each time he presses the ‘+’ button, he takes a positive token from the box and puts it in his pocket. Similarly, each time he presses the ‘–’ button, he takes a negative token and puts it in his pocket. He starts on the ground floor (Floor 0) with an empty pocket. After one hour, he checks his pocket and finds 5 positive and 3 negative tokens. On which floor is he now? He must have pressed ‘+’ five times and ‘–’ 3 times and (+ 5)+(– 3)= + 2. So, he is at Floor + 2 now. Here is another way to do the calculation. A positive token and a negative token cancel each other, because the value of this pair of tokens together is zero. These two tokens in his pocket meant that he pressed ‘+’ once and ‘–’ once, respectively, and these cancel each other. We say that a positive and a negative token make a ʻzero pairʼ. When you remove all the zero pairs, you are left with two positive tokens, so (+5) + (–3) = +2. We can perform any such addition using tokens! Example: Add + 5 and – 8. Reprint 2025-26"}

The first known instances of the use of negative numbers occurred in the context of accounting. In one of China’s most important mathematical works, The Nine Chapters on Mathematical Art (Jiuzhang Suanshu)—which was completed by the first or second century CE—positive and negative numbers were represented using red and black rods, much like the way we represented them using green and red tokens! Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 6__maths c6__p362__c1", "text": "The Other Side of Zero 267 There was a strong culture of accountancy also in India in ancient times. The concept of credit and debit was written about extensively by Kautilya in his Arthaśhāstra (c. 300 BCE), including the recognition that an account balance could be negative. The explicit use of negative numbers in the context of accounting is seen in a number of ancient Indian works, including in the Bakśhālī manuscript from around the year 300 CE, where a negative number was written using a special symbol placed after the number (rather than before the number as we do today). The first general treatment of positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero — all on an equal footing as equally-valid numbers on which one can perform the basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and even division — was given by Brahmagupta in his Brāhma-sphuṭa-siddhānta in the year 628 CE. Brahmagupta gave clear and explicit rules for operations on all numbers — positive, negative, and zero — that essentially formed the modern way of understanding these numbers that we still use today! Some of Brahmagupta’s key rules for addition and subtraction of positive numbers, negative numbers and zero are given below: Brahmagupta’s Rules for Addition (Brāhma-sphuṭa-siddhānta 18.30, 628 CE) 1. The sum of two positives is positive (e.g., 2 + 3 = 5). 2. The sum of two negatives is negative. To add two negatives, add the numbers (without the signs), and then place a minus sign to obtain the result (e.g., (– 2) + (– 3) = – 5). 3. To add a positive number and a negative number, subtract the smaller number (without the sign) from the greater number (without the sign), and place the sign of the greater number to obtain the result (e.g., – 5 + 3 = – 2, 2 + (– 3) = – 1 and – 3 + 5 = 2). 4. The sum of a number and its inverse is zero (e.g., 2 + (– 2) = 0). 5. The sum of any number and zero is the same number (e.g., – 2 + 0 = – 2 and 0 + 0 = 0). Reprint 2025-26"}

If a smaller positive is subtracted from a larger positive, the result is positive (e.g., 3 – 2 = 1). 2. If a larger positive is subtracted from a smaller positive, the result is negative (e.g., 2– 3 = – 1). 3. Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding the corresponding positive number (e.g., 2 – (– 3) = 2 + 3). 4. Subtracting a number from itself gives zero (e.g., 2 – 2 = 0 and – 2 – (– 2) = 0). 5. Subtracting zero from a number gives the same number (e.g., – 2 – 0 = – 2 and 0 – 0 = 0). Subtracting a number from zero gives the number’s inverse (e.g., 0 – (– 2) = 2). Once you understand Brahmagupta’s rules, you can do addition and subtraction with any numbers whatsoever — positive, negative, and zero! \u0007Figure it Out 1. Can you explain each of Brahmagupta’s rules in terms of Bela’s Building of Fun, or in terms of a number line? 2. Give your own examples of each rule. Brahmagupta was the first to describe zero as a number on an equal footing with positive numbers as well as with negative numbers, and the first to give explicit rules for performing arithmetic operations on all such numbers, positive, negative, and zero—forming what is now called a ring. It would change the way the world does mathematics. However, it took many centuries for the rest of the world to adopt zero and negative numbers as numbers. These numbers were transmitted to, accepted by, and further studied by the Arab world by the 9th century, before making their way to Europe by the 13th century. Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 6__maths c6__p364__c1", "text": "The Other Side of Zero 269 Surprisingly, negative numbers were still not accepted by many European mathematicians even in the 18th century. Lazare Carnot, a French mathematician in the 18th century, called negative numbers ‘absurd’. But over time, zero as well as negative numbers proved to be indispensable in global mathematics and science, and are now considered to be critical numbers on an equal footing with and as important as positive numbers — just as Brahmagupta had recommended and explicitly described way back in the year 628 CE! This abstraction of arithmetic rules on all numbers paved the way for the modern development of algebra, which we will learn about in future classes. Su m m a r y There are numbers that are less than zero. They are written with a ‘–’ sign in front of them (e.g., – 2), and are called negative numbers. They lie to the left of zero on the number line. The numbers ..., – 4, – 3, – 2, – 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... are called integers. The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, ... are called positive integers and the numbers …, – 4, – 3, – 2, – 1 are called negative integers. Zero (0) is neither positive nor negative. Every given number has another number associated to it which when added to the given number gives zero. This is called the additive inverse of the number. For example, the additive inverse of 7 is – 7 and the additive inverse of – 543 is 543. Addition can be interpreted as Starting Position + Movement = Target Position. Addition can also be interpreted as the combination of movements or increases/decreases: Movement 1 + Movement 2 = Total Movement. Subtraction can be interpreted as Target Position – Starting Position = Movement. Reprint 2025-26"}

If both numbers are positive, add the numbers and the result is a positive number (e.g., 2 + 3 = 5). b. If both numbers are negative, add the numbers (without the signs), and then place a minus sign to obtain the result (– 2 + (– 3) = – 5). c. If one number is positive and the other is negative, subtract the smaller number (without the sign) from the greater number (without the sign), and place the sign of the greater number to obtain the result (e.g., – 5 + 3 = – 2). d. A number plus its additive inverse is zero (e.g., 2 + (– 2) = 0). e. A number plus zero gives back the same number (e.g., – 2 + 0 = – 2). We can subtract two integers by converting the problem into an addition problem and then following the rules of addition. Subtraction of an integer is the same as the addition of its additive inverse. Integers can be compared: … – 3 < – 2 < – 1 < 0 < +1 < +2 < +3 < ... Smaller numbers are to the left of larger numbers on the number line. We can give meaning to positive and negative numbers by interpreting them as credits and debits. We can also interpret positive numbers as distances above a reference point like the ground level. Similarly, negative numbers can be interpreted as distances below the ground level.

The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF- SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured the students’ inherent abilities and touching upon all the five planes of human existence, the pañchakośhas, in the Foundational and the Preparatory Stages have paved the way for the progression of their learning further at the Middle Stage. Thus, the Middle Stage acts as a bridge between the Preparatory and the Secondary Stages, spanning three years from Grade 6 to Grade 8. The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages—including at least two languages native to India—to Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy—a role that will strike a Foreword"}

Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establishing conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject experts, pedagogues, and practicing teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. Adhering to the recommendations of the National Curriculum Framework for School Education, a new subject area called ‘Physical Education and Well-being’ has been introduced at the Middle Stage. This subject aims to promote love for physical activity and sports; develop capacities for skillful engagement in sports; and develop resilience, empathy, and cooperation. India has a wonderful tradition of Yoga which is a wholesome experience for maintaining mind and body wellbeing. The subject of Physical Education and Well-being includes various aspects of Yoga starting from Yama, Niyama, Āsana, Prānāyāma and Dhyāna in a progressive way from Class 3 till the Secondary Stage. This lays the foundation for holistic health and well-being. The book for Physical Education and Well-being, titled Khel Yatra for Grade 6, is meticulously designed to develop motor skills and engage children in the team sports of Kho-kho and Hand ball. Age-specific aspects of Yoga are designed to lay the foundation for healthy living. The textbook aligns with the competencies included in the NCF-SE 2023 for this stage. Khel Yatra emphasises the importance of physical activity and the values and dispositions essential for life. It incorporates cross-cutting themes, such as inclusion, gender equality, and cultural rootedness."}

However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders.

Considering the focus on holistic well-being, NCF-SE has mandated Physical Education and Well-being as a core curricular area for all stages of school education. To help the teachers and students achieve curricular goals of Physical Education and Well-being, for the first time a textbook has been designed for Grade 6. This book enables students to experience the joy of playing, explore diverse physical activities, practice fitness skills, learn basic sports skills, and immerse in the world of yoga. Sports and physical activities teach important motor skills, socio-emotional awareness and regulation, associated cognitive abilities, as well as the values of self-discipline, hard work, teamwork, and a gracious acceptance of one’s strengths and vulnerabilities. To achieve the goals of fitness, sports and holistic well-being, the Grade 6 textbook is designed to have five units. 1. Understanding the importance of Physical education 2. Motor fitness 3. Introduction to Kho-Kho 4. Introduction to Handball 5. Yoga In Unit 1, students explore the connection between physical education (PE) and well-being, emphasizing its impact on personal and social behaviour.

Students will also learn about the safety measures to minimize the risk of injuries and create a healthy environment for the players. In Unit 2, students learn different fitness components like endurance, strength, flexibility, and balance. The main aim is to understand how each of these components contributes to overall health. In the Units 3 and 4 focus is on learning new games. Kho Kho is introduced in Unit 3 and Handball in Unit 4. Through interactive sessions and group exercises, students will discover the excitement of sport and health advantages of physical activity. The emphasis will be on inclusivity, team cohesion, and enjoyment of movement. In the last unit, students immerse in the holistic nature of yoga. They learn about Yama (social discipline) and Niyama (Personal discipline) to inculcate healthy habits for positive behavior. Systematic practice of various yogasanas starting with Sūkshma Vyāyāma (loosening exercises), preparatory breathing practices and step-by-step performance of each asana helps our body to be flexible, strong, balanced and disease free. Various techniques of Prānāyāma strengthen the lungs, improves functioning of major systems of our body, calm down the mind, improve concentration and help in achieving overall harmony and well-being. To explore the world within us and experience deep sense of peace, tranquility and bliss, students learn different techniques of Dhārana (single pointed concentration) and Dhyāna (meditation). Learning various yogic practices lays foundation for long and healthy life. In this book, apart from learning the games and physical activities, students will learn to follow rules, understand the importance of safe practices and fair play, work harmoniously in groups, treat each other with courtesy and respect, as well as, help each other, and experience the joy of playing together.

{"id": "class 6__phe__p136__c1", "text": "114 Khel Yatra More than 2,000 years ago, Mahārṣi Patanjali compiled the practices of Yoga in 196 Yoga Sutras. These sutras describe a step-by-step path to achieve the highest state of bliss (Samādhi) through systematic practices defined as the eight limbs or aspects, called Ashtāṅga Yoga. We will learn more about Ashtāṅga Yoga later in this chapter. Yoga continued to evolve with new practices and ideas. Hatha Yoga, which deals with the practical aspects of Yoga, was developed around 1,500 years ago. In the 19th and 20th centuries, Yoga masters like Swami Vivekananda, Paramahamsa Yogananda, Sage Aurobindo and B.K.S. Iyengar brought Yoga to the rest of the world. Today, Yoga is practised globally; the International Day of Yoga is celebrated on 21st June in more than 190 countries. What is Yoga? Ancient Indians had discovered that practising Yoga, can lead one to good health and well-being. Yoga can be defined as the science of healthy and happy living. It helps us to be peaceful and efficient in our work, study and other activities and move towards the full realisation of our potential. The term Yoga is derived from the Sanskrit word “yuj” which means “to unite or integrate”. It signifies the union of the body, mind and inner self. Yoga is about bringing different parts of yourself to create balance, harmony and a sense of oneness – both within and with the world around you. It also helps make the mind still, quiet and free from all distractions. Yoga involves systematic efforts, not haphazard actions. Efforts become fruitful only through disciplined actions."}

Tapas teaches that hard work and dedication can help us to achieve our goals and improve ourselves. By practising Tapas, we learn the importance of commitment and how small consistent actions can lead to big results. Tapas in our life: Dedication towards studies, self-discipline, regular exercise for good health, always eating nutritious food, keeping things clean, always speaking the truth, daily practice of Yoga, etc. We see many great people around us, their success is inspiring us to set high goals in our lives. Have you heard about the Tapas of these great people? Let us read the inspiring story of Malli Mastan Babu-India’s mountain man to understand the power of Tapas. Malli Mastan Babu’s Determination Malli Mastan Babu was born in a small village in Andhra Pradesh and his father was a farmer. A bright student and eager to learn about new things, Babu studied very hard and went to some of the best schools in India. He got degrees in engineering and management. During the course of his studies, Babu developed a keen interest in mountaineering. Inspired by the challenge and beauty of the mountains, he decided to pursue this passion alongside his professional career. He trained hard, learning everything about climbing. He practiced yoga to build physical strength, flexibility and stay mentally focused, all of which helped in his challenging climbs. His dedication to physical fitness, including yoga, was a significant part of his success in achieving numerous expeditions."}

His approach to mountaineering was driven by an unwavering passion and dedication. He believed in pushing his limits and embraced the challenges that came with high-altitude climbing. Through his climbs, he aimed to inspire others to follow their dreams and overcome obstacles, no matter how difficult they might seem. Babu, whenever on expedition, would plan every last detail. He would start early in the day, carry his own load and walk at a steady clip throughout the day. During his expedition he used to pitch his own tent, cook his own food and fine-tune the next day’s plan with his guide. Babu’s record-breaking achievement was that he completed climbing seven highest peaks in seven continents in 172 days. With this, Babu set a new benchmark of physical and mental endurance and excellence. He became the first Indian and South Asian to achieve this record, earning him international recognition and admiration. Even though he is no longer with us, his story is one of extraordinary courage, determination and passion. His life reminds us to dream big, work hard and always do our best. He remains an enduring inspiration to those who dare to push their boundaries and reach for the skies.

Setting Goals: Each student writes down one goal they want to achieve, such as reading for 20 minutes every day, practising a sport, or helping with chores. 2. Plan: Write down the steps to achieve this goal. 3. Tracking Progress: Make a simple chart to track daily progress. 4. Reflection: At the end of the week, discuss what you have learned about self-discipline and how it felt to work towards achieving the goal. Pratyāhāra Pratyāhāra, the fifth aspect of Ashtāṅga Yoga, is all about learning to control your senses and focus your mind. Imagine you are in a noisy room, but you need to concentrate on your homework. Pratyāhāra means to restrain or to withdraw, not to get disturbed by things that one sees, hears, smells, tastes or feels. Pratyāhāra helps you ignore the noise and focus on what you're doing by tuning out distractions. By practising this you learn to turn your attention inward, away from the things around you and become more aware of your thoughts and feelings. We sense the world around us through five senses; to focus on the desired activity and avoid distractions, we need to master these senses by practices. Let’s look at some activities which will help us in turning senses inwards. 1. Quiet time: Find a comfortable place to sit quietly without any distractions (no TV, mobile phone, or loud noises). Close your eyes and focus on your breathing."}

Observe the sights, sounds and smells around you without getting lost in thoughts or using electronic devices. 4. Listening to music: Choose some soothing music, sit quietly and listen to the sounds without doing anything else. 5. Before going to bed: Spend a few minutes sitting quietly. Close your eyes gently and focus on your breath. Avoid using electronic devices at least 30 minutes before bedtime, instead try to read a book. These activities will help you to enhance your ability to focus, reduce stress and connect more deeply with yourselves and your surroundings.

Here let us explore Āsanas, Prānāyāma, Pratyāhāra. Dhārana and Dhyāna. We will also learn about some other aspects of Yoga, like Krīḍā Yoga in the following chapters, starting with preparatory practices. Learn these practices under the guidance of your teacher in the school and master them by performing daily at home. Regular practice (sadhana) makes us strong, flexible and calm. It helps us feel peaceful and concentrate better on our homework, during play and in everything we do. So, let’s roll out our Yoga mats, take a deep breath and start this amazing adventure together! Remember, Yoga is about feeling good; it is important to pay attention to how your body feels during the practice. Never push yourself into a pose that causes pain or discomfort. Before we start Āsanas and Prānāyāma, it is important to prepare ourselves by doing breathing practices, loosening the joints (Sūkshma Vyāyāma) and flexing the spine (Śithalīkarana Vyāyāma). General guidelines to be followed before practising all yogic practices. 1. Do not force yourself to breathe deeply or to hold your breath while doing the Āsanas. Breathe normally while doing the Āsanas. Always breathe through the nose. Preparing for Yogic Practices Chapter 2"}
{"id": "class 6__phe__p148__c1", "text": "126 Khel Yatra 2. Always be alert, attentive and watchful when you practice. Concentrate on your pose. Watch your teachers carefully and pay attention to their instructions. 3. Do not wear shoes or socks while doing the Āsanas. 4. Whenever you are feeling ill or sick, you must rest. If you have a cold, cough, headache, stomach ache, sprained ankle etc., consult your teacher and seek their guidance. 5. Especially for girls, when you have your menstrual period, inform or consult your teacher before the practice. Breathing Practices Before learning Prānāyāma, it is necessary to improve the function of the lungs. For healthy lungs, it is necessary to practice proper breathing. Let us learn about Rabbit and Dog breathing. Rabbit breathing focuses on deep, rhythmic breaths that mimic the breathing pattern of a rabbit. Dog breathing involves mimicking the rapid, shallow breathing of a dog, which can help to release heat from the body and improve breath control. Benefits Breathing practices enhance lung capacity, improve respiratory efficiency, promote relaxation and reduce stress. 7 Limitations: people suffering from epilepsy should avoid this practice."}

The term “Sūkshma Vyāyāma” comes from Sanskrit, where “Sūkshma” means “subtle” or “micro” and “Vyāyāma” means “exercise” or “movement”. These exercises are gentle, easy to perform and can be practised by people of all ages and fitness levels. The exercises involve small, subtle movements that focus on different parts of the body. These movements help to increase circulation, improve joint mobility and release muscular tension. The subtle movements enhance blood flow to various parts of the body, promoting better circulation and oxygenation of tissues. Each movement is synchronised with the breath, enhancing the flow of Prānā (vital energy) throughout the body. The simplicity of Sūkshma Vyāyāma makes it accessible to everyone, including the elderly, those with limited mobility or beginners new to Yoga. These exercises can be performed while sitting or standing. Sūkshma Vyāyāma includes neck exercises, shoulder rotations, finger and wrist movements knee movements, ankle and foot exercises, etc. Let’s practice Sūkshma Vyāyāma for the neck.

Mahārṣi Patanjali defines Āsana as “Sthirm Sukham Āsanam” which, meaning to be “able to be in a comfortable position for extended periods.” When Āsanas are combined with breath awareness, they cultivate a deeper connection between the body and mind. They also remove physical discomfort and prepare individuals for meditation. There are several benefits of practising Āsanas every day, some of which are listed below: 1. Strength and flexibility: Regular practice of Āsanas increases muscle strength, flexibility and balance. Different poses target various muscle groups, enhancing overall physical fitness. 2. Improved functioning of internal systems: Āsanas improve blood flow and oxygen delivery to all parts of the body. Many poses stimulate internal organs and glands, thus improving digestion and metabolic functions. 3.

This technique helps practitioners become more aware of their breathing, which improves lung efficiency by fully utilising different parts of the lungs. It also ensures better oxygenation of blood and reduces anxiety through deep mindful breathing.

It involves inhaling deeply and producing a low humming sound during exhalation. Bhrāmarī Prānāyāma has several benefits: 1. Reduces stress and anxiety. 2. Improves concentration and memory. 3. Improves sleep quality. 4. Induces a state of deep relaxation. 5. Balances blood pressure. Let us learn how to perform Bhrāmarī Prānāyāma: • Sit in Sukhāsana with the spine erect, face smiling and eyes gently closed. • Inhale deeply with both nostrils filling both the lungs. • As you exhale, make a steady, low-pitched humming sound like a bee. (Makara sound from Omkāra chanting) • Feel the vibration of the sound resonate throughout your head and body. • Repeat the practice five times. Note for the Teacher • Ask the students whether they could feel the resonance during the practice. Ask about their state of mind after the practice."}

As all our sense organs are turned outward they respond to speed, it is necessary to learn the art of slowing down or different ways of sublimation or willful withdrawal of our senses. The Yogic practice of Pratyāhāra helps to increase happiness by exercising moderation in food, entertainment, sleep and in all our activities. By practising Pratyāhāra one can avoid distraction caused by our senses. By doing this one can process the inward journey. In the previous chapters, we have learnt various ways of managing the senses through Pratyāhāra activities."}

When our eyes are open, we see the world outside and when our eyes are closed, we can experience the world within us. Dhārana, Dhyāna and Samādhi are three limbs of Ashtāṅga Yoga, which deal with focusing and calming the mind to experience peace and joy. The first step towards experiencing the peace within is to focus our wandering mind on some object, it can be observing the breath or flame of the candle or the tip of the thumb from the stretched hand. This single-point concentration is called Dhārana. Dhārana involves keeping the mind steady and maintaining concentration. Let us learn the art of focusing by practising Jatru Trataka using the shoulders and the thumbs. Jatru Trataka Jatru Trataka is a Yogic gazing that helps to bring one pointed concentration or focus. It is a practice where the gaze is fixed on an object or the target. Dhārana, Dhyāna, and Samādhi Chapter 5"}

It enhances self-confidence, patience and willpower. 7 Limitations: Students with severe headache should avoid the practice. Simple palming procedure: 1. Rub both palms until they become warm. 2. Cup your palms and place them gently over the eyes (do not put pressure on the eyeballs). 3. Keep the eyes closed. Keep your palms on your eyes for 10–15 seconds, then gently lift them. Note for the Teacher • Ensure that students remove their glasses and wrist watches. • Encourage them to sit with the head, neck and spine erect during the practice. Always open the eyes with a few blinks. • Ensure palming is done after each practice."}
{"id": "class 6__phe__p191__c1", "text": "169 Yoga Dhyāna Dhyāna means meditation, contemplation or reflection of the higher self or God. When concentration becomes uninterrupted and flows continuously like a stream, it transforms into Dhyāna. In Dhyāna, there is a continuous flow of attention towards the chosen focus without distraction. Unlike Dhārana where effort is required to maintain concentration, Dhyāna is characterised by a state of effortless presence and immersion in the object of meditation. Practising Dhyāna leads to a profound sense of inner stillness and tranquility. Regular practice of Dhyāna enhances mental clarity, sharpens focus, reduces anxiety and improves cognitive function. Dhyāna can be practiced in many ways. In this grade, we will learn about Nadānusandhāna (meditating on sound). Guidelines for the practice of Dhyāna 1. Find a calm and clean place. Sit in Padmāsana or Sukhāsana with the spine erect and the body relaxed. 2. Select the object of focus, such as a breath or a mantrā or some visual object and focus your attention on it. Keep your eyes closed during the practice. 3. Remain non-reactive to the thoughts or emotions that come up during the practice. 4. In the beginning it is generally difficult to observe the breath for a long time. If your mind wanders, slowly but firmly bring your attention back to your breath. 5. Consistency is important; practice dhyāna daily, starting with a few minutes and gradually increasing the duration."}

Therefore, Nādanusandhāna involves the exploration and deep meditation on sound vibrations. Different sounds like A, U, M and AUM are chanted slowly so that they generate a fine resonance all over the body. • Sit in Vajrāsana or Sukhāsana with the spine erect, face relaxed and eyes gently closed. • Adopt Cin Mudra in both hands and place it on the thighs. • Chant Akāra for three to five rounds and feel the resonance in the lower body (abdominal). • Chant Ukāra for three to five rounds and feel the resonance in the middle (chest region) part of the body. • Chant Mkāra for three to five rounds and feel the resonance in the upper (head region) part of the body. • Chant Omkāra for three to five rounds and feel the resonance in the body. • Repeat the Nādanusandhāna several times a day. It helps in the expansion of awareness. Samādhi Samādhi is the highest state of consciousness. This is possible to achieve during meditation. In Samādhi, the mind is focused perfectly on the higher self or God for a long time."}

In Sanskrit, Krīḍā means ‘play’ or ‘sports’; hence, Krīḍā Yoga means learning Yoga through play. Krīḍā Yoga helps in developing some of the principles of Yoga such as joy, being mindful, concentration, strengthening breathing, creativity and love. Krīḍā Yoga helps reduce stress and anxiety, promoting mental well-being and emotional balance. By making Yoga enjoyable and interactive, Krīḍā Yoga helps foster a lifelong interest in the practice and supports holistic development. A few games are given below, you may design new games based on various principles of Yoga and play with your friends in the class or with members of your family. Padārtha Grāhi – Mindful Eating Mindful eating is an indoor game, normally played in groups. This game can be used as an “icebreaker”, a game played to reduce inhibitions and to bring out the best in the students. In this game, food is used as a theme to encourage students to develop healthy eating habits. This game brings out creativity, awareness and emotional culture. How to play 1. Students are instructed to keep their left hand near their chest to resemble a plate. Krīdā Yoga Chapter 6"}

{"id": "class 6__science__p3__c1", "text": "Foreword The National Education Policy 2020, envisages a system of education in the country that is rooted in Indian ethos and its civilisational accomplishments in all domains of human endeavour and knowledge while at the same time preparing the students to constructively engage with the prospects and challenges of the twenty-first century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured the students’ inherent abilities touching upon all the five planes of human existence, the pañchakośhas, in the Foundational and the Preparatory Stages have paved the way for the progression of their learning further at the Middle Stage. Thus, the Middle Stage acts as a bridge between the Preparatory and the Secondary Stages, spanning three years from Grades 6 to 8. This framework, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages—including at least two languages native to India—to Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy—a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks.

It has been developed in consonance with the recommendations of NEP 2020 and the NCF-SE 2023 to take students on a journey of experiential learning by citing examples from the world of the learners. The content stimulates curiosity, a sense of exploration, questioning, and critical thinking. The content seamlessly weaves together concepts from physics, chemistry, biology, and earth science, along with cross-cutting themes like environmental education, value education, inclusive education, and Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS). The textbook aims to engage learners through an integrated approach by including multiple activities and thoughtful use of technology. The textbook offers ample opportunities for reflection and group discussions. To encourage creativity and innovation, it is feasible to regard students as active participants in the learning process, rather than mere recipients of a predetermined set of knowledge. This can only be achieved if the necessary number of hours are dedicated to science teaching–learning annually as outlined in NCF-SE 2023. The pedagogical approach of the textbook also considers how important it is for students to think critically, reason well and make decisions. It also provides students with numerous opportunities to learn from each other, making the learning experience more engaging for both teachers and students. However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years.

{"id": "class 6__science__p5__c1", "text": "About the Book Curiosity, Textbook of Science for Grade 6 learners has been crafted in alignment with the recommendations of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023. The policy advocates a radical shift from a content-based education to a competency-based education, particularly in the realm of science. Therefore, the formulation of curricular goals for Science, subsequent competencies and learning outcomes are tailored towards competency-based learning. These curricular goals encompass various scientific concepts, including matter, the physical and living world, health, hygiene, and the exploration of the interface between science, society and technology. Additionally, the goals focus on the nature of science, its processes, historical and contemporary aspects of the development of science and science communication. While these goals are explicitly articulated, they are interdependent and collectively contribute to a better understanding of the world around us. Accordingly, the chapters of this textbook are structured around creative activities, reflective questions, processes and illustrations. The integration of the concepts from biology, chemistry, physics and earth science, and cross-cutting themes, such as value education, inclusive education, Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS) and environmental education have been interwoven in the content. Thus, the textbook aims to provide experience-based learning, rather than simply reading and memorising the concepts. In the Middle Stage, science teaching–learning adopts an integrated approach. This integrated approach develops fundamental capacities across biology, chemistry, physics and earth science. The use of an integrated approach helps the learners to appreciate the interrelations between subjects and make sense of their observations and experiences. Curiosity, Textbook of Science for Grade 6, comprises twelve chapters. As the name of the textbook suggests, there are numerous opportunities for the learners to explore the world of science and its nature. Through the chapters, learners will embark on a journey that will connect them to the world around and spark curiosity for further exploration.

Chapter 1, titled ‘The Wonderful World of Science’, provides a holistic view of the new topic of Science introduced in the Middle Stage. It showcases, through examples, the essence of Science—a way of thinking, observing, and finding out by doing, and by asking questions. This chapter weaves together the concepts covered in the rest of the book, and aims to excite the readers as they start their adventures into the world of science. There are no assessment exercises in this chapter and is designed to be non-evaluative. Also, every chapter in the book begins with an introduction that makes the learners curious and tries to show different ways with which the goals of the curriculum can be achieved effectively. The chapters begin with the stories related to real-life situations, these are meant to capture learners’ interest and connect them with what is already known. The various activities given are based on scientific processes, designed to provide hands and minds-on experiences. Following each activity, there are questions to help learners understand and assess how well they have grasped the information. Questions are significant in the learning process. They help learners to explore and reinforce their understanding. One will also find many thought-provoking questions designed to encourage deep thinking, self-awareness and critical analysis. These questions prompt learners to ponder and delve deeper into their thoughts. In order to sustain the interest of the readers, some of the challenging ideas, additional information, poems, stories, strange facts and other interesting materials are also presented as add on non-evaluative content in the boxes labelled ‘Do you know?’, ‘More to know!’, ‘Think it over!’ and ‘More to do!’. The thrill of scientific inquiry comes from pursuing the unknown, giving learners the opportunity to think and explore beyond the syllabus. Some chapters also include a section called ‘Know a scientist’, which presents the contributions of Indian scientists related to that concept.

The keywords related to scientific processes depict the steps or procedure involved in the scientific activities. These words guide learners on how scientific knowledge is generated, tested and applied. ‘Summary’ offers an overview of the chapter’s main points, reinforcing the key ideas discussed. It serves to outline the content presented in the chapter. A non-evaluative interesting element that has been incorporated in some of the chapters is the introduction of certain verses from various Indian texts to promote rootedness in the learners as envisaged in NEP 2020. The primary aim of Curiosity is to prepare the children for becoming the responsible members of the society, and therefore efforts have been made to raise awareness about various issues, such as gender, region, environment, health and hygiene, water scarcity and energy conservation. Activities given in the book endeavour to promote peer-learning and group activities. The assessment exercises, ‘Let us enhance our learning’, play a vital role in the learning process. They help to reinforce the understanding and identify areas for improvement, making them essential components of effective teaching and learning. Assessment consists of various exercises, from pictorial questions to creating puzzles and multiple-choice questions, to create a challenging and interesting experience for the learners. These questions also facilitate the evaluation of various competencies expected to be developed through a particular chapter. Peer and group activities to explore answers to the questions are also encouraged. A significant feature of the book is what we termed as ‘Learning further’. In this section, some projects and activities are designed to increase learners’ interaction with experts, teachers, parents and the wider community. Learners are encouraged to gather diverse information and draw their own conclusions. The textbook is just one way to learn. Learners should enhance their knowledge by exploring and observing their surroundings.

As you enter the Middle Stage, we will continue this fascinating journey, trying to explore and understand the beautiful world we live in. And for that, we have a new subject, Science. Welcome to the wonderful world of Science! Science is a way of thinking, observing and doing things to understand the world we live in and to uncover the secrets of the universe. Think of it as a big adventure—we ask questions, explore the world and try to understand how things work. For this, the most important thing is to have ‘Curiosity’, which is where the title of this book comes from. Whether it is studying tiny grains of sand or massive mountains, a leaf of grass or a vast forest, there is always something new and exciting to discover. Have you ever looked up at the night sky and wondered why the stars shine? Or watched a flower bloom and wondered how it knows when to open?

And hopefully you will have lots of questions on your mind! Even though you may have not realised, you have already been fi nding answers to many of your questions. Suppose your pen stops writing. What would you do? You would ask yourself the question, “Why did my pen stop writing?” You might guess that the ink fi nished. You would then test this guess by opening the pen and checking the ink refi ll. If it is empty, you would know that your guess was correct. But suppose you found that the ink was not fi nished. Now what would you do? You would make another guess—perhaps the ink might have dried up. To test if this guess is correct or not, you will try something else. This is exactly how Science works!

Maniram chacha tells the students to not only observe different plants and animals but also to carefully listen to different sounds. The students come across a variety of plants, including grasses, bushes, and large trees. They also observe a variety of birds sitting on the branches of trees, butterflies moving from flower to flower and monkeys jumping from one tree to another. They record their observations in their notebooks and discuss them with Dr Raghu and Maniram chacha. The students can hear the chirping of birds. Dr Raghu informs them that each bird has a unique chirp. This is an example of diversity in nature. Dr Raghu requests Maniram chacha to mimic calls of some birds. Maniram chacha mimics different bird calls. The students enthusiastically start copying him. Have you ever observed different plants and animals around you?

You will learn more about the importance of grouping in our daily lives in the chapter, ‘Materials Around Us’. 2.2.1 How to group plants? You must have noticed that plants show variation in the features related to stems, leaves, flowers, and more. The stems of different plants vary in thickness, height, and hardness, while the leaves vary in shape, colour, size and arrangement. You might have tried grouping the plants in Activity 2.3 using one of these features. You might have also learnt in earlier classes that plants can be grouped into herbs, shrubs, and trees based on their height and types of stem. Let us study the features of plants in more detail and group them on that basis. Activity 2.4: Let us group   Let us go on a nature walk again for some more interesting observations.   Look closely at the height of different plants.

For example, a rose plant is a shrub (Fig. 2.3b). Some plants are typically small with soft and green stems. These are known as herbs. For example, a tomato plant is a herb (Fig. 2.3c). Some plants with weak stems need support to climb and grow, and are called climbers. Some plants creep along the ground and are called creepers.

You may observe thin lines on the leaves of the plants (Fig. 2.4a). These are veins. The pattern of veins on the leaf is called venation. What differences do you see in the veins of leaves shown in Fig. 2.4a and Fig. 2.4b? In some leaves, you can observe a net-like pattern of veins on both sides of a thick middle vein. This pattern is called reticulate venation. For example, leaves of hibiscus exhibit reticulate venation (Fig. 2.4a). In some leaves, you may observe that the veins run parallel. This pattern is called parallel venation. For example, the leaves of banana plants and grasses exhibit parallel venation (Fig. 2.4b and Fig. 2.4c). Reprint 2025-26"}

Animals can fly, run, crawl, walk, hop or jump, and so on. They use different body parts for moving from one place to another. They may use wings, legs, and other parts that help them to move. Here, we have identified animals based on the types of movement and the body parts used for movement. How can we group animals based on their movements? Additionally, many animals differ from each other in shape, size, structure, colour, and other features. Some of these features can also be used to group animals in various ways. Like plants, grouping of animals is important for understanding their diversity. Janaki Ammal (1897–1984) was an Indian botanist dedicated to environmental work and helped to document and preserve India’s rich plant biodiversity. She played a key role in the ‘Save Silent Valley’ movement. As the head of the Botanical Survey of India, she initiated programmes to document the plant diversity of India.

Success Story—Save Silent Valley Movement This is a real story of a forest in the Palakkad district of Kerala. It is about preserving untouched beauty of a moist evergreen forest and its rich biodiversity. The now-famous Silent Valley was saved by a remarkable movement led by common people who were not even residing in the vicinity of the forest. The battle against the proposal of a hydroelectric dam across the Kunthipuzha river persisted for 10 years. At that time, people used all possible available means, such as widespread awareness programmes, letters to editors, articles in, newspapers, seminars, and petitions and appeals in court. The movement was successful in saving the Silent Valley. 2.3 Plants and Animals in Different Surroundings You might have observed during nature walks that different animals live in different surroundings. You have also recorded movement of animals in Table 2.5. Does the movement of these animals depend upon their surroundings? Let us consider fishes and goat as examples. Fishes live in water. They have streamlined bodies and fins for movement in water (Fig. 2.8a). Goats live in grassy areas and move with the help of legs (Fig. 2.8b). The sizes and shapes of animals also differ from one another.

{"id": "class 6__science__p43__c1", "text": "Diversity in the Living World 25 from each other. Why is it so? Why does the biodiversity of a region vary from that of another? Let us find out. There is very little water available in the deserts. A hot desert is typically very hot during the day and very cold at night. Therefore, you will find plants and animals in these areas that can tolerate and survive both the hot conditions during the day and cold conditions at night. The fleshy stems of plants found in the desert can store water and help them tolerate the hot conditions in these places. The mountains in extremely cold regions experience frequent snowfall. In order to survive in such conditions, some of the trees have the ability to let the snow slide off easily. Conical shape and sloping branches of deodar trees enable them to do so easily. You must have understood by now that the biodiversity varies from region to region because of diverse conditions. Look at the images of a camel from the hot desert of Rajasthan (Fig. 2.11) and a camel from the cold desert of Ladakh (Fig. 2.12). What are the differences you observe between them? What advantages do these differences provide to these camels? The camel of the hot desert has long legs with wide hooves. Alex shares that his grandmother told him that the long legs and wide hooves help these camels to walk on the sandy desert without sinking into the sand. On the other hand, the height and legs of camels of a cold desert are comparatively shorter than those found in a hot desert. These short legs allow them to walk easily in mountainous regions.

Camels found in the hot desert have one hump each that helps them to survive during the scarcity of food. Camels found in the cold desert have two humps each. These two humps shrink in late winters because there is not much food available in the cold desert and they have to use food stored in their humps during that time. Moreover, they grow long hair from head to neck, which help them survive the cold winters of Ladakh. What other features can help camels to survive in the desert? Other students also start sharing their observations. Kashi from Rajasthan says that camels excrete small amounts of urine, their dung is dry, and they do not sweat. As camels do not lose much water from their bodies, they can survive for many days without drinking water. Maya talks about seeing plants with beautiful bright flowers, rhododendrons, in the Shola forests of Nilgiris. Here, rhododendrons are of shorter height and have smaller leaves to survive through the heavy winds on mountain tops. However, Pema, who is from Sikkim, mentions that she has observed rhododendrons in the nearby mountains to be taller (Fig. 2.13). So, even plants such as rhododendrons may exhibit different features in different regions to survive the conditions of those regions. Sagar tells his classmates that he went to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands with his parents for a special event. He saw huge whales and colourful fish in the ocean. His father explained that the streamlined body of fish helps them to swim in water. Fig. 2.13: Different features of rhododendrons Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 6__science__p45__c1", "text": "Diversity in the Living World 27 We have learnt that the plants and animals living in a particular region have special features that make them fit to survive there. The special features that enable plants and animals to survive in a particular region are called adaptations. The shape of the deodar tree and the height of the rhododendron are adaptations that enable them to survive in the mountainous regions. The place where plants and animals live is called their habitat. For example, the habitat of sea turtles is the sea or the ocean. The habitat of a camel is the hot or the cold desert, and the habitat of a rhododendron is the mountains. The habitat of plants and animals provides them food, water, air, shelter and other needs for their survival. Many types of plants and animals may share the same habitat. Habitat plays an important role in shaping the biodiversity of a region. What are the different ways in which you can group plants and animals based on their habitats? One way is to group them into those ‘that live on land’ and those ‘that live in water’. The plants and animals that live on land are said to live in terrestrial habitats. Some examples of terrestrial habitats are forests, deserts, grasslands, and mountains. Salim Ali (1896–1987) travelled across India to observe diversity in birds. He prepared a list of birds and documented their travel routes and habitats. He recorded the regions with high diversity of birds and took measures to conserve these regions. Keoladeo National Park in Bharatpur, Rajasthan and Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary in Mandya, Karnataka are examples of regions he preserved.

Some examples of aquatic habitats are ponds, lakes, rivers, and oceans. Some animals, such as frogs, can live in water as well as on land. These are called amphibians. What would happen if the habitat of a plant or an animal is damaged? What would happen if a goat does not get grass to eat? Can a fish survive without water? Check with your parents, grandparents, and neighbours to know about the plants, birds, insects or any other animal they used to see frequently in their childhood but do not see as often now. These changes often happen when habitats are damaged. The damage to habitats of plants and animals results in loss of their homes, food, and other resources. This leads to the loss of biodiversity. The population of the Bengal Tiger, Cheetah, and Great Indian Bustard has declined in India due to loss of natural habitats caused by human activities. The Government of India has initiated several projects to conserve our biodiversity. ‘Project Tiger’ was initiated in 1973 to protect the declining population of the Bengal Tiger. The ‘Cheetah Reintroduction Project’ was initiated in 2022 to restore the population of the Cheetah.

Glucose provides instant energy. Glucose is an example of a carbohydrate. Carbohydrates are one of the primary sources of energy in our diet. Cereals like wheat, rice, and maize, vegetables like potato and sweet potato, and fruits like banana, pineapple, and mango are some sources of carbohydrates (Fig. 3.2). Do you know that common sugar is also a type of carbohydrate? Why do you think we prefer to have laddoos as a part of our traditional diet in winters? Besan or wheat flour (aata) and ghee are among the main ingredients of laddoos along with goond (edible gum), nuts, and seeds. Ghee and various kinds of oils are grouped under another kind of food component, which is called fat. Yes, my grandma told me that laddoos rich in ghee and nuts provide energy to keep us warm. Sources of fats can be from plants or animals (Fig. 3.3). Nuts, such as groundnuts, walnuts, coconuts, and almonds, and seeds, such as pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds, are some sources of fat.

During a voyage in 1746, Scottish physician James Lind observed that sailors who consumed lemons and oranges recovered from these symptoms. Bleeding and swollen gums are symptoms of a disease called scurvy. Case 2 In the 1960s, Indian scientists found that among the human population in the Himalayan region and the Northern plains of India, symptoms of swelling at the front of the neck were prevalent. As per norms of the Government of India, an effort was made to supplement common salt with iodine for preparing iodised salt. Consumption of iodised salt visibly reduced the above symptoms. These symptoms were due to a deficiency of iodine in the soil of this region resulting in a lack of iodine in the local food and water supply. Swelling at the front of the neck is a symptom of a disease called goitre. The right amount of protein must be included in the diet of growing children for their proper growth and development.

What differences do you observe in raw and cooked vegetables? Have you ever noticed that vegetables sometimes lose their bright colour, or become softer and less crisp when cooked? Some nutrients like vitamin C and others are lost during cooking due to high heat. Would it not be wise to include fruits and uncooked vegetables into our diet? Washing cut or peeled vegetables and fruits may also result in the loss of some vitamins. However, it is highly recommended that all fruits and vegetables be thoroughly washed before consumption. Fruits and vegetables are rich in dietary fibres. Let us see how dietary fibres are beneficial for us. In addition to the essential nutrients, our body needs dietary fibres and water. Dietary fibres, also known as roughage, do not provide any nutrients to our body. However, they are an essential component of our food. They help our body get rid of undigested food and ensure smooth passage of stools. Roughage in our food is provided mainly by suitable plant products.

But in her story, a situation arose wherein the sailors got caught in a storm with an overcast sky and stars were not visible. Reshma could not take her story forward as she could not think of a way for sailors to find directions. She searched for information on the internet and her school library. She learnt that the travellers used a device, known as a magnetic compass, for finding directions. Reshma had seen pencil boxes and purses which had magnets to keep them closed.

A freely suspended magnet rests along the north-south direction because our Earth itself behaves like a giant magnet. Repeat this activity with a small iron bar in place of the bar magnet. What do you observe? Does it always rest along north-south direction? It does not. It can rest along any direction. This implies that only magnets rest along north-south direction. This activity provides us with a way to test whether a piece of metal is a magnet or not. The property of a freely suspended magnet to always rest along the north-south direction is used to find directions. Based on this, a small device called a magnetic compass was developed in olden days for finding directions. It has a magnet in the shape of a needle which can rotate freely (Fig. 4.6). The needle of a magnetic compass indicates the north-south direction. The compass is kept at the place where we wish to know the directions. After some time, the needle comes to rest in the north-south direction. The compass box is then gently rotated until the north and south marked on the dial are aligned with the needle. Now all directions at that place are as indicated on the dial. A magnetic compass is usually a small circular box with a transparent cover on it, as shown in Fig. 4.6. The magnet, in the shape of a needle, is mounted on a pin standing on the bottom of the box. This needle is balanced on the pin in such a manner that it can move around this point easily, that is, it can rotate freely.

If the ends of the scale are broken or the zero marking is not clear, it can still be used for measurement. With such a scale, use any other full mark of the scale, say, 1.0 cm (Fig. 5.6). Then you must subtract the reading of this mark from the reading at the other end. For example, in Fig. 5.6, the reading at one end is 1.0 cm and at the other end, it is 10.4 cm. Therefore, the length of the object is 10.4 cm–1.0 cm = 9.4 cm. Fig. 5.6: Correct method of placing the scale with broken end How do visually challenged students measure lengths?

About 4000 BCE onwards, Sindhu-Sarasvatī developed techniques of wheel- turned pottery production, pigmentation, application of protective or decorative coats (called ‘slips’) of multiple colours, decorative painting, etc. These techniques became further sophisticated during the Sindhu-Sarasvatī (also known as ‘Harappan’) Civilisation (2600–1900 BCE), with a bright red surface painted with black-coloured designs displaying geometric patterns, and aquatic and terrestrial animals. The clay used for making pots, dishes, bowls and other items was carefully selected and cleaned, sieved, kneaded, turned over a wheel and finally baked in kilns (baked clay is called ‘terracotta’).

Do any of these materials shine when light falls on them? Observe their texture (whether Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6 Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 6__science__p125__c1", "text": "107 rough or smooth), colour and other noticeable features, and record your observations in the notebook. Group the collected pieces based on their appearance. Materials that typically have shiny surfaces are said to have a lustrous appearance. Such materials with lustre are usually metals. Examples of metals include iron, copper, zinc, aluminium, gold, etc. However, some metals may lose their lustre and start to look dull or non-lustrous due to the effect of air and moisture on them. As a result, we often notice the lustre only on their freshly cut surfaces. Non-lustrous materials are those that do not have a shiny surface. Some examples of non-lustrous materials are paper, wood, rubber, jute, etc. “All that glitters is not gold” goes an old saying! Not all the materials that shine are metals. Surfaces of some materials are made shiny by polishing or coating them with thin layers of plastic, wax or any other material which makes them look shiny. These materials may not be metals. 6.3.2 Which materials are hard? When you press different objects or materials with your hands, some of them like stones, may be hard to compress, while others, like an eraser, can be easily compressed. Take a metal key and use it to scratch the surface of a piece of wood, aluminium, stone, iron, candle, chalk and any other material or object. Can some materials be scratched more easily than others? Materials which can be compressed or scratched easily are soft, while other materials which are difficult to compress or scratch are hard. However, these properties are relative in nature. For example, rubber is harder than sponge but softer than iron. Activity 6.5: Let us observe   Hold the objects given in Table 6.3 with your hands. Feel whether the objects are hard or soft.

Can we give a general name to anything that possesses these two properties? Anything that occupies space and has mass is called matter. The mass gives the quantity of matter, and the units to measure it are gram (g) and kilogram (kg). The space occupied by matter is its volume. The units to measure the volume are litre (L) and millilitre (mL). Kilogram is the unit of mass in the International System of Units (SI). Kilogram is abbreviated in lower case as kg. There is no space between ‘k’ and ‘g’ in kg, and no full stop after the symbol, except at the end of a sentence. While writing the mass, always leave a space between the number (numerical value) and the unit. For example, if we have mass of 7 kilograms, it would be written as 7 kg and not as 7 kgs. Similarly, litre is abbreviated as capital L and millilitre as mL. There is no space between ‘m’ and ‘L’ in mL. For example, if you have 500 millilitres of water, it would be written as 500 mL, m will be in lower case and L will be in upper case. The SI unit for volume is cubic metre, abbreviated as m3. The abbreviation is written with a superscript 3 to denote cubic metre. For example, if you have volume of 2 cubic metres, it would be written as 2 m3.

A hotter body has a higher temperature than a colder body. The difference in temperature between the two bodies tells us how hot a body is in comparison to another body.

Temperature in a digital thermometer is determined with the help of heat sensors. temperature when the thermometer is placed in contact with a person’s body. For measuring temperature, the clinical thermometers generally use a scale called the Celsius scale. On this scale, the unit of temperature is degree Celsius and is denoted by °C. They are non-contact thermometers, also called infrared thermometers. Such thermometers can measure temperature without touching a person’s body and thus reduce the risk of spreading disease.

But in this activity, did you find that the normal temperature of every person was 37.0 °C? Or did you find the temperature slightly higher or lower for some people? The temperature of every person may not be 37.0 °C. What we call normal temperature is the average body temperature of a large number of healthy people. A perfectly healthy person may, therefore, have a normal temperature slightly different from 37.0 °C. The body temperature is influenced by several factors, such as age, time of the day and activity level. You may try measuring your own temperature at different times of the day and on different days. Record the thermometer readings in your notebook. After a month, analyse your temperature record and see if there are any variations. If yes, try to think what might be the reasons for that. The temperature of human beings does not normally go below 35 °C or above 42 °C. For measuring the body temperature of small children or old people, the digital thermometer can also be placed in the armpit. The temperature measured this way is about 0.5 °C to 1 °C lower than the actual body temperature. There is another scale of temperature known as Fahrenheit scale. On this scale, the unit of temperature is degree Fahrenheit and is denoted by °F. A temperature measured as 37.0 °C on Celsius scale is equivalent to 98.6 °F on Fahrenheit scale. The Fahrenheit scale is not used in most scientific studies anymore. In scientific work, there is another scale of temperature known as Kelvin scale. On this scale, the unit for temperature is kelvin and is denoted by K. The SI unit of temperature is kelvin.

These forms are also called states. These different states of water show many differences in their behaviour. Water flows but ice does not. Water splashes but ice does not. 8.1 Investigating Water’s Disappearing Act It is a rainy morning. While going to school, Aavi and Thirav observe that there are a lot of water puddles in the playground. That evening, when they go to play, they are surprised to observe that some of the water in the puddles had disappeared. Have you ever noticed water in the puddles disappearing? Where does it go? Discuss with your friends. Where else have you seen water disappearing? Can you think of a possible reason why this happens? You might have observed that after washing the utensils, water left on the surface of the utensils, dries up after some time.

What do you infer? Is this activity enough to come to the conclusion that water does not seep through a steel plate? If water does not seep through the steel plate. Then, where has the water gone? This water gets converted into gaseous state called water vapour. The water vapour is another state of water. Let us think of another observation where you notice the water disappearing. While making dosa, we sprinkle some water on the hot pan and it disappears. Where does it go? Fig. 8.1: Steel plate with a tablespoon of water The water which is sprinkled on the hot pan gets converted into steam. Steam is actually water vapour, some part of which converts into water droplets. The process of conversion of water into its vapour state is called evaporation. The process of evaporation takes place continuously, even at room temperature. Can you think of other examples of evaporation? Drying of wet clothes, mopped floor, and sweat on our body are some examples of it. Now what do you think is the reason for the disappearance of water from the puddles? Is it due to: (i) seeping of water into the ground or (ii) evaporation of water or (iii) both of these? Hand sanitiser disappears as you rub it on your hands. What happens to it?

What do you think? When the water vapour present in the air comes in contact with a cold surface, it forms water droplets. The process of conversion of water vapour into its liquid state is called condensation. After understanding the concept of condensation of water, let us go back to Activity 8.3.

Water is a substance that can be observed in three different states in our daily life. In the solid state, it exists as ice. On heating, the ice melts and gets converted into its liquid state. On further heating, water gets converted into its gaseous state. Let us perform Activity 8.5 to identify the properties of different states of water.

{"id": "class 6__science__p169__c1", "text": "A Journey through States of Water 151 What are the differences in the properties of water in solid, liquid and gaseous states? Ice (solid state) retains its shape irrespective of the container in which it is placed while water takes the shape of the container. Ice does not flow or spread. Water (liquid state) flows and changes its shape. Water does not have a fixed shape. It takes up the shape of the container in which it is kept, but the volume of water remains constant. Does water also possess the property to spread? Yes, water also has the property to spread while keeping the volume constant. Water vapour (gaseous state) exhibits a property of spreading out in the entire available space. Gases do not possess a fixed shape. Water vapour exists even at room temperature; though it is invisible to us. It is present in the air around us. The water that evaporates during processes like drying of clothes or mopping of floors contribute to the water vapour in the air around us. You are now familiar with the three states of water. Some other substances also exhibit these states. For example, wax, oil and ghee. Let us look at some more examples of solids, liquids and gases. Look around and find some examples of solid substances. Some examples could be stones, wood and glass. What are the other examples of liquids you can think of? Here are two examples— milk and oil. Think of five more examples. Have you ever noticed that you can smell the food being cooked even without entering the kitchen? How does this smell reach us? It is because the smell of yummy food from cooking spreads through the air and reaches our nostrils, even if we are not in the kitchen. What are the other examples of gases you can think of? What about oxygen and carbon dioxide? 8.4 How can we change the States of Water? So far we have learnt that water can exist in solid, liquid and gaseous states. How can you change the state of water?

{"id": "class 6__science__p170__c1", "text": "Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6 152 How can you quickly change ice to its liquid state, water? If we have to change ice into water, and water into water vapour, we have to supply heat to it. If we want to change water into ice, what should be done? It can be done by placing water in a cold environment, such as a freezer. Water freezes and is converted into ice. If we take the ice out of the freezer, it melts and is converted into water. Can you think of any other example, besides water, that can change from solid to liquid? A candle, which is made of wax, is one such example. How can we turn candle wax into liquid state? How can we change the liquid wax back into solid state? We should cool the liquid wax to change it into a solid. What are the other liquids you have seen which get converted into a solid? Have you ever seen coconut oil getting converted into its solid state during the winter season? Hence, we can see that water and other substances change their states on heating or cooling.

How does this happen? When air moves higher above the Earth’s surface, it becomes cooler and cooler. At certain heights, the air gets so cool that the water vapour in it turns into droplets which are generally formed around dust particles. These small droplets float in the air and form clouds. Many droplets join together to form bigger drops of water. Some drops get so heavy that they start falling. These falling water drops are what we call rain. Fig. 8.8: A surahi Why does air containing water vapour go up in the atmosphere (thin layer of air that surrounds the Earth)? As we know, gas balloons containing lighter gases go up in the air.

The number of people using water is increasing with a rise in population. The increasing demand for water causes its shortage in many parts of the world. Hence, it is very important to use water wisely and avoid wasting it. Let us keep our water bodies free from pollution.

To keep them busy, Nani gives them a challenge of handpicking small stones from grains while keeping their eyes closed. The method of picking by hand from a mixture (when two or more substances are mixed) such as small stones and husk from wheat and rice is called handpicking. It is done on the basis of differences in size, colour and shape of the particles. If the particles to be removed are present in small quantities and can easily be picked by hand, handpicking proves to be a convenient method. At lunch, Malli and Valli are served steaming hot vegetable pulao. While eating the pulao, Nani observes that Malli is separating whole black peppers from the pulao and is placing them aside on his plate (Fig. 9.1). Valli playfully teases, “Wow! This is a handpicking method, nice one!” Nani tells them about the benefits of black pepper and encourages Malli to eat it. Later in the day, their Mama takes them to the fields where they observe bundles of harvested wheat stalks lying in the fields. Some stalks are spread in the sun for drying. Both of them pick up a stalk each and notice numerous grains attached to it. A group of farmers are beating the stalks on a large wooden log. Curiously, Valli asks Mama, “Why are they doing this?” Mama explains, “They are beating the stalks to separate the grains” (Fig. 9.2).

For instance, a car does not grow. Does it mean it is non-living? Now, which characteristics have you used to classify a car as non-living? Continue your discussion in a similar way to identify the essential characteristics of living beings. What are some common characteristics that make living beings very different from the non-living things? Let us learn about them. Can we consider movement as one of the characteristics to differentiate between the living and the non-living? List five things around you that can move on their own. Do you think that all five things that you have listed can be considered as living just because they can move on their own? However, unlike animals, plants do not move from one place to another. Do you consider them as living? Even though plants do not move from one place to another, they do show certain types of movements. Opening of flowers is one of the examples of movement in plants. Another example of movement in plants is seen in insectivorous plants. Insectivorous plants are dependent on insects for their nutrition. Drosera is one of the examples of an insectivorous plant. Drosera is featured with saucer-shaped leaves having many hair-like projections of unequal length with sticky ends. Whenever an insect enters the saucer, hairs move inward and trap the insect with their sticky ends. Try to observe the mechanism of movement in other insectivorous plants. Climbers also wind themselves around any object placed close to them. That means, even though plants do not move from one place to another, they do show some movements.

This is due to growth in your body. Plants and other living beings also grow. Can we consider growth as a characteristic of living beings? Living beings need food (nutrition) for their growth and development. List five living beings that require food to grow. Now, think of a process without which we cannot live. Count the number of breaths you take per minute after a normal walk, after a run, and after a few dance steps. Record the data and observe. Do you notice any difference in the number of breaths after each situation? Do you notice the process of breathing in other animals like dogs, cats, cows and buffaloes? Notice the movement of their abdomen while they are taking rest. In the process of breathing, when we inhale, the air moves from outside to inside our body. When we breathe out, the air moves from inside our body to outside. Breathing is part of a process called respiration. Do plants also respire? There are tiny pores called stomata on the surface of leaves. These pores help plants in taking air in and out. Interact with senior class students in your school and request if they can demonstrate stomata using a microscope in your class. All living beings respire. Have you noticed white patches forming on shirts around the armpits during summers? These patches are formed due to sweat. The sweat consists of water and salts removed by the body as waste products. Removal of waste products from the body is called excretion. Urine is also formed as a product of excretion in animals. Do you know that plants also excrete? You may notice plants excrete excess water and minerals in the form of small droplets on leaves. For example, grasses and roses. All living beings excrete. Let us look at another characteristic.

Stepping on a thorn and touching a hot object are stimuli. Any thing or any event that prompts living beings to respond is called a stimulus. List three stimuli (plural of stimulus) and your body’s instant response to them. Do plants also respond to stimuli? Yes, plants also respond to stimuli. For example, touch- me-not (mimosa, chhui-mui, lajjalu) plants fold their leaves when we touch them. Have you also observed that certain plants fold their leaves after sunset? Specifically, the leaves of certain plants facing each other tend to come together. This can be observed in the sleeping leaves of amla (Indian gooseberry) tree. All living beings respond to stimuli. Find a few more plants in your neighbourhood which fold their leaves after sunset. Why do the leaves of chhui-mui and amla plants respond in this way? Which stimulus could be responsible for their behaviour? Have you seen young ones of cats, dogs or other animals? List young ones of five different animals.

Do your observations match with your predictions? Write possible reasons in favour of your observations in Table 10.2. Based on your observations, state the conditions which favour seed germination. Which of the following are essential for seed germination– air, water and sunlight? Compare the available conditions in each pot. Germination of bean seeds requires the right amount of water and air. Why do seeds require these conditions for germination? Do you think that the absence of one or more of these conditions will affect seed germination? Let us understand how these conditions help in seed germination. The effects of the following conditions have been seen in Activity 10.2. Water: Seeds require water for germination. Water enables the seeds to carry out the processes necessary for their growth. The outer covering of the seed is called seed coat. Water softens the seed coat and helps the tiny embryo inside it to develop into a plant. Air and Soil: Seeds need air for germination. They use the air available in the spaces between soil particles. Moreover, spaces between the soil particles allow roots to grow easily. Light and/or dark conditions: We have learnt that for the bean seeds, presence of light is not essential for their germination. In general, most seeds do not require light for germination. But after germination, sunlight is required for further growth of the seedling. Germinated bean seed Seed Coat Embryo Reprint 2025-26"}

Mosquitoes pass through four stages in their life cycle— egg, larva, pupa and adult (Fig. 10.6). The adult mosquito that emerges from the pupa rests briefly on the surface of water and then flies away. The adult mosquito may survive for 10 to 15 days. We have seen that a mosquito begins its life as an egg (stage I), the egg develops into a larva (stage II), the larva grows into pupa (stage III), and the pupa transforms into an adult mosquito (stage IV). The adult female mosquito lays eggs directly on or near water, and the cycle continues. Significant changes occur in the appearance, body shape and structure during the various stages in the life cycle of a mosquito. The shape of the egg is quite different from the larva; the larva appears very different from the pupa. The pupa appears very distinct from the adult mosquito. Is it easy to imagine that a mosquito emerges from a pupa? The silk moth also passes through four life stages—egg, larva, pupa and adult. Eggs hatch into larvae, which then grow in size. Larvae secrete thread-like material which they wrap around themselves, before changing to pupae. These are the fibres that are used to make silk fabric. In India, the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) has set up several centres for silk production.

From this activity, we find that it is difficult to hold our breath for a long time. The air which we breathe in has oxygen. Our body needs oxygen to perform its functions. When we hold our breath for a long time, the body does not get enough oxygen to perform its functions. Thus, we need oxygen for our survival.

Waste from homes and industries pollute our water sources when it is dumped into them. Identify other human activities that lead to water pollution. Discuss with your friends in the class what you can do to reduce water pollution. Polluted water is not fit for consumption by living beings. As freshwater sources are limited, there is a shortage of water in many parts of India. At some places, people have to walk long distances to fetch drinking water. Everyone does not have the same kind of access to water. It is important for us to conserve water and use it judiciously. We must also prevent it from being polluted so that water remains fit for consumption by all living beings. In what ways can you conserve water? Water harvesting is one of the methods for conserving water. In many buildings, rainwater is collected and stored in large quantities for later use. This is called rainwater harvesting (Fig. 11.4a). Do you know that rainwater is also harvested in many homes, residential societies or schools? It is an age-old practice in India. For example, stepwells (Fig. 11.4b), commonly known as Bawadi in Rajasthan and Vav in Gujarat are built for water harvesting as a response to the scarcity of water in these regions. These stepwells have a unique system of water harvesting. They store not only rainwater but also water seeping from nearby lakes, ponds and rivers. The walls of the trenches (long deep holes dug in the ground) are lined with blocks of stones that allow seepage of water. Find traditional water harvesting practices in your locality.

We can use dried chillies when fresh ones are not available. I will give you some to take home. Do you know that the Sun is the main source of energy on Earth?

But it does not mean that it is getting energy from the Sun. The cow is eating grass. Grass leaves need sunlight to grow. So, the main source of energy is the Sun.

Let us explore. 11.4 Forests One morning, Ajji takes Bhoomi and Surya for a walk in the forest. They find a variety of herbs, shrubs and trees in the forest. Ajji explains, “Forests are large areas with dense growth of various types of plants.” On the way, they collect some nellikai (Kannada term for Indian gooseberries) that have fallen on the ground.

Forests are a natural home for many wild animals, including birds and insects. Forests provide food and shelter to them. In nature, every animal depends on other life forms for survival. The diversity of life forms ensures food for every living being. However, over the years, the forest cover has been decreasing, mainly due to human activities like large scale cutting of trees. It takes many years to grow a new forest or restore lost forests. Therefore, we must preserve and use forests responsibly so that they get enough time to regenerate. Van Mahotsav is a week- long event celebrated across the country during the month of July. It is a forest festival during which new plants and trees are planted, and awareness about respecting forests is raised. The aim of the event is to increase the green cover. You too can plan a Van Mahotsav in your community. From ancient times, India had a tradition of respecting, protecting and preserving forests. You have already learnt about sacred groves in the chapter ‘Diversity in the Living World’. Many efforts have been made by common people to prevent the cutting of trees, and thus, saving forests. One such effort is the famous Chipko movement. It started in the early 1970s in Uttarakhand (previously part of Uttar Pradesh). Local women actively participated in this movement. They encircled and hugged the trees to protect them from being felled. Do you know? What are the consequences of cutting a large forest area?

Ajji explains, “The roots of plants hold on to the soil and prevent it from being washed away. The leaves that fall from the trees decay and enrich the soil with nutrients. This soil is used by new plants and trees to grow. This is an example of recycling in nature.” Let us investigate the soil in more detail. 11.5 Soil, Rocks and Minerals Bhoomi, Surya and Ajji come back home from the forest. Bhoomi and Surya help Ajji in preparing the soil in the garden for planting some vegetables (Fig. 11.5). Ajji asks them to dig the soil gently and loosen the lumps. You have already learnt in the chapter ‘Living Creatures: Exploring their Characteristics’ that for plants to grow, the space between the soil particles not only provides sufficient air but also space for the roots to grow easily. Bhoomi and Surya could see small pebbles, the roots of plants and a few earthworms too in the soil. Do you realise that earthworms are natural agents that help in turning and loosening the soil?

They are formed essentially from the remains of microorganisms and plants that got buried deep inside the earth, and were converted to petroleum, natural gas and coal. It takes millions of years for these fuels to form. Natural gas is used for cooking and generating electricity. Nowadays, it is also used in the form of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) as a fuel for vehicles. It is a cleaner fuel than petrol or diesel. Coal is mainly used for the production of electricity.

Over-dependence on fossil fuels for transportation and as domestic fuels has resulted in large scale air pollution. 11.7 Natural Resources: renewable and non-renewable Nature’s treasures fulfill our needs. They are essential resources to sustain all life forms on the Earth. For example, we get heat and light from the Sun, water from rivers, and food from plants and animals. These resources which we get from nature are called natural resources. We also use natural resources to make many useful things for our convenience. For example, electric bulbs, furniture, solar panels, bicycles, etc., make our lives comfortable. All such resources created by human beings are called human-made resources.

The seeds from the droppings of animals and birds would enable new trees to grow, though it would take some years before we get fruits from these new trees. Thus, resources which get renewed, replenished or restored within a reasonable period of time are called renewable resources. Air, water and forest are some of the examples of renewable natural resources. Nature renews them. We should use our natural resources judiciously. On the other hand, fossil fuels take millions of years to form. They are found in limited quantities and once used, they get exhausted. They are not produced or replenished within a reasonable period of time. These resources are called non-renewable resources. Examples of non-renewable natural resources are minerals, soil, rocks, coal, petroleum and natural gas. 11.8 Resources we use It is time for Bhoomi and Surya to go back home after a wonderful holiday at their Ajji’s home. Their Amma (mother) comes to pick them up. Bhoomi and Surya show her the vegetable plants that have started to grow in the garden and the dried chillies given by Ajji to take home.

They can smell smoke from the vehicles. The air is polluted. Amma says, “Yes. When we use fossil fuels in our vehicles, smoke is generated. Now, there are vehicles which cause less pollution. For example, there are electric vehicles that do not release any smoke. So, people are making an effort to create alternatives.” Can you list some alternatives for reducing air pollution?

The weather in Nubra is almost cloudless. With almost no air or light pollution, the night sky is very clearly visible. Night after night, Yangdol and Dorjay observe the stars and experience an immense sense of awe.

Stars shine with their own light. Some groups of stars appear to form patterns which are like shapes of familiar things. Long ago, when watching stars in the night sky was a favourite pastime of our ancestors, they identified these star patterns with animals, things or characters in stories. Many cultures had names for patterns based on their own stories. These imaginary shapes helped them in recognising stars in the sky. Recognising stars and their patterns was a useful skill for navigation in the olden times. Before the arrival of modern technology or even before the invention of the magnetic compass, it helped people, particularly sailors and travellers, in finding directions at sea or on land. It is still used in emergencies as a backup method. In earlier times, groups of stars forming patterns were called constellations. Currently, the regions of sky, which include these groups of stars, are defined as constellations. However, since in constellations, the patterns of stars are often the most prominent, the term constellation is still commonly used for these groups of stars. Do we find patterns among the stars just for fun or is there some use of these patterns? Since different cultures denoted the constellation boundaries in different ways, an internationally agreed set of constellation boundaries were defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in the early twentieth century. 88 constellations were officially listed, thus, dividing the entire sky into 88 regions. These regions of sky are now defined as constellations. More to know! Some constellations are shown in Fig. 12.3. The stars are joined by imaginary lines, drawn for easy identification. The constellation Orion is often represented as a hunter. There are three stars in the middle, which represent the belt of the hunter. Some people imagine that the hunter Orion, followed by his dog (constellation Canis Major), is battling a bull (constellation Taurus). Canis Major contains a star Reprint 2025-26"}

If you stay in a big city, you may find that the sky is rarely clear and only a few stars are seen in the night sky. This is due to light pollution, smoke and dust. The presence of excessive artificial light at night time is referred to as light pollution. In villages or areas where there is less light pollution, a larger number of stars can be seen. Also, your house may be surrounded by tall buildings and trees, which may block your view. The night sky is best viewed from open dark areas. Light pollution is growing sharply globally. This is reducing our ability to enjoy and study objects in the night sky. Some dark sky reserves and parks have been established around the world. Light pollution in the reserves is controlled to preserve dark skies for research. There are a few organisations which are working to educate people about reducing light pollution. Do you know? Not all stars and constellations are visible from all places on Earth and on all nights in a year. For example, the Pole Star is not visible from the southern hemisphere of Earth. To identify a star or a constellation, you need to know how a particular constellation looks like and where to look for it in the night sky. To get familiar with the pattern of a constellation you may use images such as Fig. 12.3 and Fig. 12.4. To find out when and in which portion of the sky a star or a constellation will be visible from your location, you may take the help of sky mapping apps that can be downloaded on a mobile phone, or other online resources.

In India, the Sun is worshipped as Sūrya. The heat provided by the Sun keeps the Earth at a temperature that makes life possible. Sunlight is essential for plants to grow, which provide food and oxygen to animals, including humans. The Sun is responsible for climate, seasons, weather, water cycle, winds—all of which are important for sustaining life on the Earth. The distance of the Sun from the Earth is about 150 million km. A useful unit for expressing distances within the solar system is ‘astronomical unit’ (au) which is approximately the distance between the Sun and the Earth. The Sun produces heat and light, and is the main source of energy on the Earth (Fig. 12.6). How big is the Sun? It is about 100 times bigger than the Earth in diameter. And still, it looks so small because it is very far from the Earth. However, the Sun is much closer to us than the other stars hence it appears much bigger than the stars. As the stars (other than the Sun) are much farther away, they appear like points, even though some of those stars are much bigger Our Sun is also a star.

Mars is called the Red Planet because it appears red. This is because the soil on Mars is reddish in colour. A large portion of the Earth’s surface is covered with water and thus, it appears blue from the space. Due to this, the Earth is also called the Blue Planet. The four outermost planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune—are much larger compared to the Earth, and are mostly made of gases. These giant gaseous planets have large flat ring-like structures around them which are made of dust particles and rocky material. Planets get most of their energy from the Sun. So, the farther they are, the colder they are in general. The presence of an atmosphere on a planet can trap heat which can significantly change the temperature of a planet. That is why Venus, for example, is hotter than Mercury, although it is farther from the Sun. There is another object called Pluto that lies farther than Neptune, and revolves around the Sun. It is smaller than the Earth’s Moon. When it was discovered, it was called a planet of the Solar System.

{"id": "class 6__sst__p3__c1", "text": "iii Foreword Foreword The National Education Policy 2020 envisages a system of education in the country that is rooted in Indian ethos and its civilisational accomplishments in all domains of human endeavour and knowledge while at the same time preparing the students to constructively engage with the prospects and challenges of the twenty-first century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured the students’ inherent abilities touching upon all the five planes of human existence, the pañchakośhas, in the Foundational and the Preparatory Stages has paved the way for the progression of their learning further at the Middle Stage. Thus, the Middle Stage acts as a bridge between the Preparatory and the Secondary Stages, spanning three years from Grade 6 to Grade 8. This framework, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages — including at least two languages native to India — to Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-Being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy — a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality Reprint 2025-26"}

Various Curricular Area Groups, which were constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. This textbook of Social Science closely follows the vision of the NCF-SE 2023. It innovates in minimizing the text by focusing on core concepts and major developments. These are also conveyed through abundant pictures, drawings, maps and other graphics, which are brought to life by a pleasant and attractive overall design. The textbook seeks to keep students engaged through a variety of exercises, occasions for reflection, activities and projects, all of which invite them to explore and discover by themselves. The selection of five themes takes care of the important requirement of maintaining a multidisciplinary perspective. Cultural rootedness, another requirement, is thus not limited to the theme ‘Our Cultural Heritage and Knowledge Traditions’, but pervades the other themes as well. It is hoped that students and teachers alike will find using this textbook an enjoyable and enriching experience. However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years.

One of them is Social Science. You had a brush with it earlier, but from this Grade 6 onward you will discover more of this world of ours, beginning with our country, India. We have done our best to make this textbook stimulating:  Whenever possible, we have used your immediate environment — the world as you know it — as a starting point.  We have tried to keep the text to a minimum by focusing on the ‘big ideas’ — ideas you will encounter in your life for sure. Ideas that will help you understand India and the world.  We have encouraged you to reflect on these ideas or important facts — to explore, discover, think, create, ask questions and propose answers. Rote learning is not the goal of good education; understanding and reflection are.  We have included more illustrations than ever before, as they often convey a message better than long explanations. They also make the textbook more lively and pleasant to browse through.  We have selected five main themes — you will see them in the Table of Contents. This has enabled us to combine in a single theme inputs from several disciplines — whether history, geography, political science or economics. This brings us closer to real life.  Finally, we have given some emphasis to understanding India’s foundations. India is a young nation but an old civilisation. The former would not exist without the latter. Preparing this textbook has been a labour of love. If you have felt attracted to a few pages here and there, to some picture Reprint 2025-26"}

We wish you an enjoyable journey through Social Science and its rich insights into human life and society.    A note on the pronunciation of Sanskrit words Since this textbook is in English, we use the Roman alphabet. But we will also encounter some words in Sanskrit and a few other Indian languages. The Roman alphabet cannot make their pronunciation clear without some additional marks or signs, such as dashes, dots or accents, called ‘diacritical signs’ or ‘diacritics’. You can ignore all these signs if you wish, and you don’t need to remember them. However, as we are using only a few simple signs, you will find it easy to get used to them. You will also find that they help you pronounce Sanskrit words fairly correctly. Here is how they work:  A short dash (called ‘macron’) over a vowel makes it long. For instance, dāna is pronounced ‘daana’; līlā is pronounced ‘leelaa’; sūtra is sootra.  śh and ṣh are pronounced similar to ‘sh’ in ‘shall’ (there is a slight difference, since they correspond to श and ष in the Devanagari script; see next point). So śhāstra is pronounced ‘shaastra’; kṣhīra is ‘ksheera’.  Consonants with a dot below them (ḍ ṭ ṣh and ṇ mainly) are pronounced by hitting the tongue on the roof of the mouth; without a dot, they are pronounced with the tongue on the teeth. Examples of consonants pronounced with the tongue hitting the roof of the mouth: Āryabhaṭa, gaṇa, paṭhana (studying), pīṭha, goṣhṭhī (association, assembly), dhanāḍhya (rich), aṇu (atom).  Finally, ṛ is the Devanagari letter ऋ. We choose to write it as ṛi, although in some parts of India it is also pronounced as ṛu. So we write ‘Ṛig Veda’, for instance. Reprint 2025-26"}

On the other hand, the world is witnessing multiple wars, armed conflicts and rising social tensions, and our planet’s natural environment is under great stress. We live in an age of great possibilities but also great challenges. The world over, more and more people wonder, “How do we solve the problems facing humanity? How can our societies learn to live in peace and harmony? How can we protect this beautiful Earth which we all share — and protect it not only for ourselves but also for all the species that live on it?” These fundamental questions are simple, but the answers are not. They cannot be simple, because human societies are very diverse and complex. If we wish to find answers to such questions and help build a better future, we first need to understand our world, and human societies in particular. That is what Social Science is all about.

Social Science has many subdisciplines: geography, history, political science, economics, sociology, anthropology, archaeology, psychology and a few more. You need not feel intimidated by all these terms! While you will study some of these subdisciplines in the Secondary Stage, in the Middle Stage we have avoided this classification. Instead, we have opted for five broad themes. Let us briefly look at them. Theme A – India and the World: Land and the People This first theme includes the basics of the geographical world around us — some of the main features of our planet and the way to represent them on a map. Why is this theme important, when today we can get excellent maps on a mobile phone? Because it deals with much more than maps. It also asks how geographical features — oceans, mountains, rivers, etc. — have shaped entire civilisations throughout their histories. It is also, in India’s case, about how its natural setting has contributed to giving this ancient civilisation a unique identity. Theme B – Tapestry of the Past A tapestry is a large piece of canvas-like cloth usually kept as a wall hanging, with pictures and designs on it — sometimes a historical narrative. Our tapestry is where we will be painting scenes from the past, beginning with India’s past. But why should we be at all concerned with the past? Because it is the key to understanding the present, and the chapters in this theme will often make this connection clear. The past is a major source for our identities — it helps us understand who we are and where we come from. Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 6__sst__p25__c1", "text": "5 Introduction – Why Social Science? The past is still with us, in other words. And since history is unfortunately not all about happy developments, it is useful to understand where people, governments or rulers went wrong, and why. Only then can we hope to avoid repeating those errors. Theme C – Our Cultural Heritage and Knowledge Traditions It has often been said that India has a rich and ancient culture. True, but what are its main characteristics? Its guiding principles? How has it manifested itself in India’s history? And how can it help us to deal with issues of our times? These are some of the questions that this theme is exploring, with the objective that every student should understand some of the cultural foundations of our civilisation and learn to appreciate their value. Theme D – Governance and Democracy Citizens of any country should know how their political system functions. India, as the world’s largest democracy, has an elaborate system working at different levels. What are its chief characteristics and components? How do the citizens participate in the overall governance? What are their rights and also their duties or dharma? Are there different systems in other countries, and, if so, of what type? How are different countries supposed to interact? By studying this theme, we can become more responsible citizens, understand how the organs of the government function, and learn to have a say in the policies that affect us all, whether locally or nationally. Theme E – Economic Life Around Us No family can be happy without the essentials of daily living — at least food, clothing, shelter, access to water in a first stage; in a second, livelihood for adults and access to education for the younger ones.

What exactly is money? Where does it come from? How can it be increased? What economic activities can people engage themselves in? How are natural and human resources best managed? This theme will lay down some of the important concepts and practices that will enable us to answer these questions.    You will notice that there are many questions in the preceding paragraphs. This is as it should be — Social Science is also about the art of asking the right questions. Only then can we start looking for the right answers. This also explains the presence of ‘Big Questions’ at the start of each chapter in this book. You may also be intrigued to find a game of chess and some ancient Tamil poetry in chapters that apparently deal with geography; a discussion on the uses of the sari in a chapter on cultural heritage; the concept of sevā and the mention of festivals in chapters focusing on economics. This is deliberate. We believe in bringing elements from diverse fields together (you will learn later that this is called ‘multidisciplinarity’). This enriches our perspective. Indeed, life constantly mixes numerous elements together, so why should we not? By now, it should be clear that although Social Science makes constant use of the past, it seeks to make sense of the present so as to help us prepare a better future. It is an exploration and an adventure. Reprint 2025-26"}

Imagine that you just got off a train at the railway station, and you want to visit the bank marked on the map. Which way would you go? Are there other possible ways? Can you locate the public garden, the school and the museum? If you want to proceed from the bank to the market, which way will you go? This is where a map comes in handy! A map is like a treasure guide; it shows you where things are and how to get to them. Notice the four arrows in the top right corner of the map; we will soon see how they point to some specific directions and make maps even more helpful. Fig. 1.1. A map of an imaginary small city.

A Map and Its Components From this simple example, we understand that a map is a representation, or a drawing, of some area — it may be a small area (a village, a town, etc.), a bigger area (say, your district or state), or a very large area like India or even the whole world. In a map, you look at the surface as if you are viewing it from the top. An atlas is a book or collection of maps. As you will discover, there are several kinds of maps —  physical maps, which mainly show some natural features such as mountains, oceans and rivers (see an example in Fig. 5.2 in this textbook)  political maps, which show details of countries or states, boundaries, cities, etc. (for instance, a map of India with all its States, Union Territories and their capitals)  thematic maps, with a specific kind of information (examples include Fig. 6.3 and Fig. 8.1 in this textbook).

Let us now define them more precisely. Have you ever wondered how a huge place can fit on a small piece of paper? It is all thanks to the map’s scale. Let us go back to our map of a small city (Fig. 1.1). Each centimetre on the map, as printed here, represents a certain distance on the ground — let us suppose it is 500 metres; we say that the scale is 1 cm = 500 m. Now, turn to the map of India in Fig. 5.2 in Chapter 5 of this textbook. The scale is repre- sented in the bottom left corner by a ruler with ‘500’ written above its length and ‘km’ on the side. It simply means that this ruler, which measures 2.5 cm in the printed map, corresponds to 500 kilometres on the ground. So, the actual distance between two points represented on the map depends on the scale that the map is using. LET’S EXPLORE Æ Draw a simple map of a school’s playground. Let us assume it is a rectangle, 40 m in length and 30 m in width. Draw it precisely with your ruler on a scale of 1 cm = 10 m. Æ Now measure the diagonal of the rectangle. How many centimetres do you get? Using the scale, calculate the real length of the playground’s diagonal, in metres. Let us return to the four arrows at the top right of the small city’s map. They point to four directions, which are north, at the top, and, moving clockwise, east, south and west. These are called the cardinal directions, also cardinal points. Other than these, intermediate directions are also used — northeast (NE), southeast (SE), southwest (SW) and northwest (NW). Most maps simply have an arrow marked with the letter ‘N’, which points to the north direction. North South East West Northwest Southwest Northeast Southeast Reprint 2025-26"}

Æ Taking your school as the starting point, do you know approximately in which cardinal direction your home is located? Discuss with your teacher and your parents. Symbols are another important component of maps. Our map has small drawings of actual buildings and a few other elements, but there would not be enough space on the map of a large city or a country to draw them all. Instead, a symbol is used to represent these features — symbols for different kinds of buildings (for instance a railway station, a school, a post office), for roads and railway lines, and for natural elements such as a river, a pond or a forest. In that way, numerous details can be shown in the limited space available on a map. To make maps more easily understood by a variety of users, map makers use specific symbols. Different countries use different sets of symbols. The Survey of India, a government body, has fixed a set of symbols for maps of India (or parts of India). A small selection of them is shown in Fig. 1.2 on page 12. LET’S EXPLORE Draw a rough map of your locality or your village, including your home, school and a few other important landmarks.

It nearly has the shape of a sphere. (We say ‘nearly’ because it is not a perfect sphere, but is slightly flattened at the poles. However, in practice, we will consider it to be spherical.) Representing a sphere accurately on a flat sheet of paper is not possible. To understand why, peel an orange in such a way that you have just three or four large pieces of the skin; then try and flatten them on a table — you will see that you cannot do it without tearing them at the edges.

Because the globe and the Earth have the same spherical shape, a globe will better represent the geography of the Earth than a flat map. Let us now explore some of its features. a) Understanding coordinates Imagine a big market in a city or town, with neat rows of shops, all the same size. You want to meet a friend at a stationery shop inside the market. But your friend does not know where the shop is. So you would give directions like, “Meet me at 6 pm at the 7th shop in the 5th row from the entrance.” This will allow your friend to precisely determine your location. Now, consider a chessboard. To record moves by advanced players, letters are placed alongside the main pieces (from ‘a’ to ‘h’, see the image) and numbers (from 1 to 8) in between the two sides. This simple system allows players to mark each square and record every move. Here, the white side has just opened the game by moving the queen’s pawn two squares forward (a very common opening). So, the pawn is said to have moved from d2 to d4. LET’S EXPLORE Using the same terms, write down your move if you play black and respond with the same move. Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 6__sst__p34__c1", "text": "14 Exploring Society: India and Beyond India and the World: Land and the People The system used in these two examples may be called a system of coordinates. Thanks to their two coordinates, the stationery shop as well as the chess square on the chessboard can be precisely determined. A similar system of coordinates is used in the world of maps to determine the location of any place on a map. Let us see how this system works. b) Latitudes Let us return to the globe. It is easy to identify the North Pole and the South Pole on it. Rotate the globe; while it rotates, the fixed points at the top and bottom are the two poles. Halfway between them is the Equator; note the circle marking it (see Fig. 1.3). Imagine that you stand on the Equator and travel towards one of the poles; your distance from the Equator increases. Latitude measures this distance from the Equator. At any point of this travel, you can draw an imaginary line that runs east and west, parallel to the Equator. Such a line is called a parallel of latitude and it draws a circle around the Earth. Again, it is easy to note on the globe that the largest circle is the Equator, while the circles marked by the parallels of latitude grow smaller as we move northward or southward (Fig. 1.3). Latitudes are expressed in degrees; by convention, the Equator is latitude 0° (zero degree), while the latitudes of the two poles are 90° North and 90° South respectively; this is noted 90°N and 90°S. There is a connection between latitude and climate. Around the Equator, the climate is generally hot (it is also called ‘torrid’). As you travel away from the Equator towards one of the two poles (in other words, as your latitude increases), the climate becomes more moderate (or ‘temperate’). And closer to the North or South Pole, the climate grows colder (or ‘frigid’). You will learn in Science why this is so, and Reprint 2025-26"}

Slowly rotating the globe eastward, we can note that for some places on the Earth it is morning, while for others it is mid-day, evening or night — when it’s breakfast time in one country, it’s lunchtime in another and in a third country people are fast asleep! That is why by measuring the longitude of a place, we will also be measuring the time at that place. Let us see how. To measure longitudes, we need to define a reference point called the Prime Meridian (Fig. 1.3 on page 15). It is also called Greenwich Meridian because, in the year 1884, some nations decided that the meridian passing through Greenwich, an area of London in England, would become the international standard for the Prime Meridian. It is marked as 0° longitude. Just as latitude is a measure of the distance from the Equator if you travel towards one of the poles, longitude is a measure of the distance from the Prime Meridian if you travel along the Equator. Longitude, too, is measured in degrees. Westward or eastward, it increases in value from 0° to 180°, with the letter ‘W’ or ‘E’ added. For instance, using round figures, New York’s longitude is 74°W, while Delhi’s is 77°E and Tokyo’s is 140°E. DON’T MISS OUT As you can see on the globe of meridians of longitudes, 180°W and 180°E are the same longitude; so this longitude is noted 180°, omitting the letter W or E. Latitude and longitude together are the two coordinates of a place. With them, you are now able to locate any place on Earth! You can now understand a statement such as “Delhi lies at 29°N latitude and 77°E longitude” (these values are rounded off, not exact).

The same method can be used to calculate the local time of any place on the Earth. But it would not be convenient for a country to use many local times! That is why most countries adopt a standard time based on a meridian passing through them. Indian Standard Time (IST) is 5 hours 30 minutes (also noted 5.5 hours) ahead of the local time at Greenwich (called Greenwich Mean Time or GMT). LET’S EXPLORE Return to the two friends sitting in Gujarat and Assam. Use this example to explain the difference between local time and standard time. All these standard times are organised in time zones, which broadly follow the zones of 15° in the graph (Fig. 1.7). But let us consider the world map below (Fig. 1.8). We can see that the lines dividing the time zones are not fully straight. This is because they have to respect each country’s standard time and, therefore, tend to follow international borders. The numbers written inside some countries are the numbers of hours to be added to GMT to get their standard times if they have a positive sign, or subtracted from GMT if they have a negative sign.

Similarly, the globe in Fig. 1.9, centred on India, shows standard times with respect to GMT for a few countries.

This means that most of the Earth’s surface is actually covered with water — almost three-fourths of the surface, in fact. That is why, when seen from outer space, the Earth appears mostly blue. Indeed, early astronauts lovingly called the Earth the ‘blue planet’. The largest water bodies we see on the globe are called ‘oceans’.

Land, as you may have noticed, has many forms and features; its appearance changes a lot from one region to another. Suppose that you are travelling by road from the region known as Chhota Nagpur in Jharkhand, reach Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh, and go on to Almora in Uttarakhand. On the way, you will see very different landscapes. In fact, you will encounter three major landforms, which we will now explore.

Or within some 50 kilometres? Compare with other groups. Æ In the same groups, discuss a journey that any of you has made through a region of India. List the different landscapes seen on the way. Compare with other groups. A landform is a physical feature on the surface of our planet Earth. Landforms take shape over millions of years and have a significant connection with the environment and life. They can broadly be divided into three categories — mountains, plateaus and plains (Fig. 3.1). These landforms have different climates and are home to a variety of flora and fauna. Humans have adapted to all landforms, but the number of people living on different kinds of landforms varies throughout the world. Mountains Mountains are landforms that are much higher than the surrounding landscape. They can be recognised by a broad base, steep slopes and a narrow summit. Depending on their height, some mountains are covered with snow. At lower altitudes, the snow melts every summer and turns Altitude: The height of an object above sea level.

In the West, the conventional year for Jesus Christ’s birth has generally been taken to be the starting point for this calendar. Years are counted forward from this point and used to be marked with ‘AD’ (an abbreviation for a Latin phrase that refers to the years after Jesus’ birth). However, this is now called the Common Era or CE across the world. For example, 1947, the year India gained independence, can be written as 1947 AD (sometimes AD 1947) or 1947 CE. Similarly, the years before the conventional date for the birth of Jesus are counted backward and used to be marked with BC (or Before Christ). They are now called Before Common Era or BCE.

They used fire and started making objects that made their lives easier, like improved stone axes and blades, arrowheads and other tools. Aspects of their life are visible in rock paintings found in hundreds of caves all over the world. Some of those paintings depict simple figures or a few symbols; others are more detailed and represent scenes with animals or humans. In time, these early humans learned to make simple ornaments such as stone or shell beads, pendants made of animal teeth, and sometimes exchanged them with other groups. The First Crops Over long ages, the Earth’s climate has gone through many changes. At certain times, it was very cold and much of the Earth was covered with ice — this is called an ‘Ice Age’, as you will learn in greater detail in Science. Later, when the climate warmed up, this ice partly melted, and the resulting waters swelled the existing rivers and eventually drained into the oceans. The last Ice Age lasted from over 100,000 (one lakh) years ago to around 12,000 years ago. Afterwards, living conditions improved for humans; in many parts of the world, they started settling down and cultivating cereals and grains. They also domesticated animals such as cattle, goats, etc. With more food available, these communities grew in size and number, and often settled down near rivers. This was not only because of the availability of water, but also because the soil would be more fertile there. It made the process of growing crops easier.

Leaders or ‘chieftains’ were responsible for the well-being of the people, and everyone collectively worked towards the community’s welfare. For example, there was no sense of individual ownership; the lands were collectively sowed and harvested. As time went by, hamlets grew into sizeable villages that exchanged goods — mostly food, clothing and tools. Slowly, networks of communication and exchange were established among those villages, and some of them grew into small towns. New technologies appeared — for example pottery, for making pots and other clay objects; and the use of metal (copper first, iron later), which helped make durable tools, objects of daily use and ornaments. We will see in Chapter 6 how this stage prepared for the emergence of what is called ‘civilisation’.

Interestingly, it lists many regions, such as Kāshmīra (more or less today’s Kashmir), Kurukṣhetra (parts of Haryana today), Vanga (parts of Bengal), Prāgjyotiṣha (roughly today’s Assam), Kaccha (today’s Kutch), Kerala (more or less today’s Kerala), and so on.

But when do we come across a name for the entire Indian Subcontinent? Because ancient Indian texts are difficult to date, this is not an easy question to answer. The Mahābhārata uses the terms ‘Bhāratavarṣha’ and ‘Jambudvīpa’, and scholars generally agree that this long poem was written from a few centuries BCE onward. The first term, ‘Bhāratavarṣha’, clearly extends to the entire Subcontinent, and the text includes the names of numerous rivers and peoples. ‘Bhāratavarṣha’ means ‘the country of the Bharatas’. ‘Bharata’ is a name that first appears in the Ṛig Veda, where it refers to one of the main Vedic groups of people. In later literature, several kings named ‘Bharata’ are mentioned. The second term, ‘Jambudvīpa’, means ‘the island of the fruit of the jamun tree’. This is indeed a common tree native to India, also called ‘jambul tree’, ‘Malabar plum tree’, etc. ‘Jambudvīpa’ came to mean the Indian Subcontinent.

In the 6th century BCE, a Persian emperor launched a military campaign and gained control of the region of the Indus River, which, as we saw, was earlier called ‘Sindhu’. So, it is no surprise that in their earliest records and stone inscriptions, the Persians referred to India as ‘Hind’, ‘Hidu’ or ‘Hindu’, which are adaptations in their language of ‘Sindhu’. (Note that in ancient Persian, ‘Hindu’ is a purely geographical term; it does not refer here to the Hindu religion.) Based on these Persian sources, the ancient Greeks named the region ‘Indoi’ or ‘Indike’. They dropped the initial letter ‘h’ of ‘Hindu’ because this letter did not exist in their Greek language.

This made those plains fertile and, therefore, favourable to agriculture. A little further east, a few millenniums ago, another river, the Sarasvatī, used to flow from the foothills of the Himalayas through Haryana, Punjab, parts of Rajasthan and Gujarat (see Fig. 6.3). In this whole region, from about 3500 BCE, villages grew into towns, and with increasing trade and other exchanges, those towns further grew into cities. This transition happened around 2600 BCE. Archaeologists gave this civilisation several names — ‘Indus’, ‘Harappan’, ‘Indus-Sarasvatī’ or ‘Sindhu-Sarasvatī’ civilisation. We will use all these terms. Its inhabitants are called ‘Harappans’. It is one of the oldest civilisations in the world. Tributary: A river that flows into a larger river (or lake). For instance, the Yamuna is a tributary of the Ganga.

But there are also many sites along the Sarasvatī River, which today goes by the name of ‘Ghaggar’ in India and ‘Hakra’ in Pakistan (hence the name ‘Ghaggar-Hakra River’). This river is now seasonal, because it flows only during the rainy season. The Sarasvatī River is first mentioned in the Ṛig Veda, an ancient collection of prayers which we will read about in Chapter 7. In this text, Sarasvatī is worshipped both as a goddess and as a river flowing ‘from the mountain to the sea’. Later texts describe the river as drying up and eventually disappearing. Town-Planning Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, now in Pakistan, were the first two cities of this civilisation to be discovered; their identification goes back to 1924, a century ago. Several sites followed in the Indus plains, which is why the civilisation was initially called ‘Indus Valley civilisation’.

It is interesting to note that the Sarasvatī basin includes not only two major cities — Rakhigarhi and Ganweriwala — but also several smaller ones (Farmana in Haryana, Kalibangan in Rajasthan) and a few towns (Bhirrana and Banawali, both in Haryana); indeed, the map (Fig. 6.3 on page 89) makes clear the high density of sites in that region. The larger Harappan cities were built according to precise plans. They had wide streets (Fig. 6.4 and 6.5 on page 92), which were often oriented to the cardinal directions. Most cities seem to have been surrounded by fortifications and had two distinct parts — the ‘upper town’, where the local elite probably lived, and the ‘lower town’, where common people lived. Some large buildings seem to have been used for collective purposes — for instance, warehouses where goods to be transported were stored. Individual houses of various sizes lined the streets and smaller lanes. Interestingly, the quality of construction was the same for small and big houses. All those buildings were generally made of bricks. The purpose of some of the structures remains a matter of debate. This is the case of the famous ‘Great Bath’ in Mohenjo-daro (Fig. 6.6 on page 93), a small but elaborate tank which measured about 12 × 7 metres and had waterproofing materials (such as natural bitumen, a form of tar) applied on top of carefully laid-out bricks.

They exported ornaments, timber, some objects of daily use (Fig. 6.11 on page 98), probably also gold and cotton, and possibly some food items. The most favoured ornaments were beads of carnelian (Fig. 6.10 on page 98), a reddish semiprecious stone found mostly in Gujarat. Harappan craftspeople developed special tech- niques to drill them, so a string could pass through them, and to decorate them in various ways. They also worked conch shells into beautiful shell bangles, which requires sophisticated techniques as shell is a hard material.

Indeed, the Harappans do not seem to have kept any army or weapons of war; as far as the evidence goes, it seems to have been a relatively peaceful civilisation. Two factors are currently agreed upon. First, a climatic change which affected much of the world from 2200 BCE onward, causing reduced rainfall and a drier phase. This would have made agriculture more difficult and could have reduced food supply to the cities. Second, the Sarasvatī River dried up in its central basin; suddenly, cities there, such as Kalibangan or Banawali were abandoned. There could have been other factors, but these two remind us of how much we depend on climate and the environment for our well-being.

Some of these branches are about art, literature, science, medicine, religion, the art of governance, martial arts, and so on. There are also ‘schools of thought’, by which we mean groups of thinkers or spiritual seekers who share similar ideas about human life, the world, etc. Many archaeologists and scholars have pointed out that some of India’s cultural roots go all the way to the Indus or Harappan or Sindhu-Sarasvatī civilisation (which we visit in Chapter 6).

The word “Veda” comes from the Sanskrit vid which means ‘knowledge’ (hence vidyā, for instance). We briefly mentioned the Ṛig Veda in earlier chapters. In fact, there are four Vedas — the Ṛig Veda, the Yajur Veda, the Sāma Veda and the Atharva Veda. They are the most ancient texts of India, and indeed among the most ancient in the world. The Vedas consist of thousands of hymns — prayers in the form of poems and songs — that were recited orally, not written. Those hymns were composed in the Sapta Sindhava region (which we visit in Chapter 5). It is difficult to say when exactly the Ṛig Veda, the most ancient of the four, was composed; experts have proposed dates ranging from Spiritual: Concerned with the spirit or soul (ātman in Sanskrit and many Indian languages).

A group of texts known as ‘Upaniṣhads’ built upon Vedic concepts and introduced new ones, such as rebirth (taking birth again and again) and karma (our actions or their results). According to one school of thought, generally known as ‘Vedanta’, everything — human life, nature and the universe — is one divine essence called brahman (not to be confused with the god Brahmā) or sometimes just tat (‘that’).

So Uddālaka tested him with questions on the nature of brahman, which Śhvetaketu could not answer.

He also saw an ascetic, who appeared to be happy and at peace. Following this experience, Siddhārtha decided to give up his palace life, leaving behind his wife and son. Travelling on foot as an ascetic, meeting other ascetics and scholars, he searched for the root cause of suffering in human life. After meditating for many days under a pipal tree at Bodh Gaya (today in Bihar), he attained enlightenment; he realised that avidyā (ignorance) and attachment are the source of human suffering and conceived a method to remove these two causes. Siddhārtha, then, became known as the ‘Buddha’, which means the ‘enlightened’ or ‘awakened’ one. The Buddha started teaching what he had realised, including the idea of ahimsa, which is generally translated as ‘non- violence’, but originally means ‘non-hurting’ or ‘non-injuring’. He also insisted on a sincere inner discipline. The following saying of his expresses this simply: The Buddha teaching (Ajanta caves) Reprint 2025-26"}

Jainism Jainism is another important school of thought that became widespread at the same time, although its roots are said to be much more ancient. Just like Siddhārtha Gautama, Prince Vardhamāna was born into a royal family in the early 6th century BCE. His birthplace was near the city of Vaiśhālī, in modern-day Bihar. At the age of 30, he decided to leave his home and go in search of spiritual knowledge. He practised an ascetic discipline and, after 12 years, achieved ‘infinite knowledge’ or supreme wisdom. He became known as ‘Mahāvīra’, or ‘great hero’, and started preaching what he had realised. DON’T MISS OUT The word ‘Jain’ or jaina comes from jina, meaning ‘conqueror’. This does not refer to the conquest of territory or enemies, but to the conquest of ignorance and attachments, so as to reach enlightenment.

The first may be illustrated by this saying of Mahāvīra: “All breathing, existing, living, sentient creatures should not be slain, nor treated with violence, nor abused, nor tormented, nor driven away.” Let us define the last two in simple terms:  Anekāntavāda means ‘not just one’ aspect or perspective. That is, the truth has many aspects and cannot be fully described by any single statement.  Aparigraha means ‘non-possession’ and advises detachment from material possessions, limiting oneself to what is truly necessary in life. Jainism also insists on the interconnectedness and interdependence of all creatures, from humans to invisible organisms, as they support each other and cannot live without one another. Scientists studying nature, flora and fauna, have again and again confirmed this deep truth. The Jātaka tales, which have delighted generations of Indian children and adults, tell stories of the Buddha’s former births and express in simple terms the Buddhist values. In a well-known tale, the Buddha was the king of a large troop of monkeys. They lived near a huge tree which bore fruit of divine fragrance and taste.

The soldiers attacked the monkeys. The only way for the monkey-king to save his monkeys was to help them cross the stream, but they could not do so on their own. Being much larger than them, the monkey-king caught hold of a tree on the other bank and let them use his body as a bridge to cross the stream, although he was severely bruised in the process and eventually died. The king, who watched the scene from a distance, was greatly moved by the monkey-king’s selfless sacrifice. He thought about the role of a king with respect to his subjects. A Jain story Rohineya was an extraordinarily skilled burglar who evaded all attempts to catch him. On his way to a city, he accidentally heard a few sentences from a sermon that Mahāvīra was giving about achieving liberation from the ordinary life of ignorance. Reaching the city, Rohineya was recognised and arrested. He pretended to be a simple farmer. A minister devised a clever plan to force him to confess his identity. But Rohineya, remembering Mahāvīra’s words, was able to detect the minister’s plan and defeat it. Feeling remorseful, Rohineya approached Mahāvīra, confessed his crimes, returned the stolen treasures, and asked for forgiveness.

This is because there are many aspects to those schools and systems, which we will explore gradually — a philosophical aspect, a spiritual aspect, a religious aspect, an ethical aspect, a social aspect, to name a few. Many scholars agree that the word ‘religion’ is too limiting in the context of the Indian civilisation. There were yet other schools of thought at the time. For example, one of them, known as the ‘Chārvāka’ school (sometimes also ‘Lokāyata’), believed that this material world is the only thing that exists, and therefore there can be no life after death.

This is the ‘trunk’ of the tree we started this chapter with. Folk and Tribal Roots The cultural roots we have seen so far are well documented in many texts. India has also had rich ‘oral traditions’, that is, teachings or practices transmitted through everyday practice, without written texts (this is the case of the Vedas). Among them are numerous folk traditions, that is, transmitted by common people, and tribal traditions, transmitted by tribes. What is a tribe? There are many definitions for this social entity. Today, anthropologists usually consider a tribe to be a group of families or clans sharing a tradition of common descent, a culture and a language, living as a close-knit community under a chief and holding no private property. Interestingly, ancient India did not have a word for ‘tribe’ — tribes were just different janas that lived in a specific environment, such as forests or mountains. The Constitution of India uses the terms ‘tribes’ and ‘tribal communities’ in English, and janjāti in Hindi. According to official figures, in 2011 India had 705 tribes spread over most States, amounting to a population of about 104 million people — more than the populations of Australia and the United Kingdom together! In the 19th century, anthropologists studying tribes often described them as ‘primitive’ or ‘inferior’ to civilised people.

{"id": "class 6__sst__p141__c1", "text": "121 7 ― India’s Cultural Roots There has been a constant interaction between folk and tribal traditions, and the leading schools of thought such as those we mentioned in this chapter. Deities, concepts, legends and rituals have been freely exchanged in both directions. For instance, according to tradition, Jagannath, worshipped at Puri (Odisha), was originally a tribal deity; this is also the case with various forms of the mother-goddess worshipped across India. Some tribes, on the other hand, adopted Hindu deities long ago, and possess their own versions of the Mahābhārata and the Rāmāyaṇa — this has been well documented from India’s northeastern States, all the way to Tamil Nadu. How have such interactions taken place for so long and so naturally? It is, in the end, because folk, tribal and Hindu belief systems have many similar concepts. For instance, in all three, elements of nature such as mountains, rivers, trees, plants and animals, and some stones too, are regarded as sacred, because there is consciousness behind all of them. Indeed, tribes generally worship many deities associated with those natural elements. For the Toda tribals of the Nilgiris of Tamil Nadu, for instance (one of them is pictured in the image on the right), over thirty peaks of this mountain range are residences of a god or a goddess; those peaks are so sacred that the Todas avoid pointing to them with a finger.

This is also the case of the god Khandoba in parts of central India. In eastern India, the Munda and Santhal tribals, among others, worship Singbonga, a supreme deity who created this whole world. There are many more such examples. The Indian sociologist André Béteille summed up this situation in these words: “The thousands of castes and tribes on the Indian subcontinent have influenced each other in their religious beliefs and practices since the beginning of history and before. That the tribal religions have been influenced by Hinduism is widely accepted, but it is equally true that Hinduism, not only in its formative phase but throughout its evolution, has been influenced by tribal religions.” Clearly, the result of this long interaction has been mutual enrichment. In this manner, folk and tribal beliefs and practices also count among India’s cultural roots. We will further develop this point in the next chapter. Before we move on … Æ The Vedas, India’s earliest texts, gave rise to several schools of thought. Vedanta and Yoga are among the best known.

With over 1.4 billion inhabitants (about 18 percent of the world’s population), such diversity is not surprising! In the late 20th century, the Anthropological Survey of India, a national organisation, conducted a massive survey called ‘People of India project’ of 4,635 communities across all States of the country.

Indian literatures are extremely diverse (and among the most abundant in the world). Over centuries, despite differences in language, technique, etc., they have shared important themes and concerns. Who has not heard of the Pañchatantra, for example? This collection of delightful stories, with animals as the main characters, teaches us important life skills. The original Sanskrit text is at least 2,200 years old, but its stories have been adapted in almost every Indian language. In fact, they have travelled well beyond India, all the way to Southeast Asia, the Arab world and Europe, inspiring new collections of stories on the way — it is estimated that about 200 adaptations of the Pañchatantra exist in more than 50 languages! This illustrates how ‘one’ collection of stories has become ‘many’. The most striking case, however, is that of India’s two epics — the Rāmāyaṇa and the Mahābhārata. Epic: A long poem generally narrating the adventures of heroes and other great figures of the past. These two long Sanskrit poems, which together might fill some 7,000 pages in their original versions, narrate the stories of heroes who fight to re-establish dharma. In the Mahābhārata, the Pāṇḍavas, with Kṛiṣhṇa’s help, fight their own cousins, the Kauravas, to recover their kingdom. In the Rāmāyaṇa, Rāma, with the help of his brother Lakṣhmaṇa and of Hanuman, defeats the demon Rāvaṇa, who had kidnapped his wife Sītā.

The anthropologist K.S. Singh directed the ‘People of India’ project we referred to earlier (see page 126). In the case of the Mahābhārata, he observed, “There is hardly a place in the country which the epic heroes such as the Pandavas, did not visit according to folklores.” And the same may be said of the Rāmāyaṇa.

When a large number of people live together, there can be disagreements and disorder, and rules become necessary to maintain order and harmony in the society. There are probably some simple rules at home that you are expected to follow. The school where you study has rules too — some for students, others for teachers. In higher classes, students appearing for examinations must follow certain rules. Drivers on the road are expected to obey traffic rules. People employed in all kinds of jobs also need to follow the rules set by their employer, while the employers must also follow rules which they have committed to their employees. What would happen if no one followed those rules? A simple answer is that society would not be able to function.

The group of individuals or the system that makes the rules and ensures that they are followed is called a government. Some of the more important rules are called laws.

Three Organs of Government All over the world, digital technologies have been transforming the way societies function. In India, till about 30 years ago, people who wanted to transfer money to a distant relative would have to queue up at the Post Office to send a money order after filling up a form; or if they had to send a payment to some business, they would queue up at their bank to obtain a demand draft, which would then have to be sent by post. You have probably never heard these terms (‘money order’ or ‘demand draft’), because today we have digital means of sending across money instantly! However, this has also created a new class of criminals who, without even leaving their desks, find digital ways of stealing people’s money. This has led many governments to pass new laws in order to fight such criminal activities (called ‘cybercrime’). Some of those criminals, who believe in robbing innocent people of their hard-earned money instead of using their skills to contribute to the society, have been arrested and convicted in court. They are usually fined as well as jailed for some years. Through this example, we can see how the three branches or ‘organs’ of a government work together:  The legislature is the organ that makes new laws (or ‘legislates’). Sometimes it also updates or removes Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 6__sst__p174__c1", "text": "154 Exploring Society: India and Beyond Governance and Democracy existing laws. This is done by an assembly of represen- tatives of the people. We will soon see how the Indian system works.  The executive is the organ that implements (or ‘executes’) the laws. This includes the head of state (who may be a president, a prime minister or a chief minister), the ministers and any agency responsible for enforcing ‘law and order’. (In our example above, that agency is the cyber police.)  The judiciary is the system of courts which decides whether someone has broken the law and, if so, what course of action should be taken, including punishment if necessary. Sometimes it also examines whether a decision taken by the executive is right, or whether a law passed by the legislature is well conceived and fair to all. LET’S EXPLORE Explain how the three government organs are at work in the case of the cybercriminals described above. How do they intervene? In a good system of governance, these three organs must be kept separate, although they interact with each other and work together. This separation is called the ‘separation of powers’ (Fig. 10.3). It is intended to provide a system of checks and balances. This means that each organ of the government can check what the other is doing and restore balance if one organ acts beyond its expected role.

In many countries, including India, it functions at three levels or tiers — local, state or regional, and national. Each level deals with different matters. To use a comparison, if a bulb in your home is not lighting up, you will first check the bulb, switch, fuse, etc. If that does not work, you may call an electrician, and if it is found that the problem is not within your home, you may need to go to the Electricity Board and file a complaint. These are also three levels of dealing with a problem.

If it involves several towns and many villages, the State Government will step in and send rescue teams to help affected people. But if it’s a massive flood affecting vast areas, the Central Government may also come to help by sending relief supplies, the army, etc. These are the three levels again.

This is one of the foundation stones of the system of governance adopted by most countries of the world — democracy. The word ‘democracy’ comes from two Greek words — dēmos meaning ‘people’, and kratos meaning ‘rule’ or ‘power’; so ‘democracy’ literally means the ‘rule of the people’. But can all people actually rule? It is clearly not possible. Imagine there is a problem that your class wants to bring to the attention of your school’s principal — maybe there is something wrong with the classroom, or with the school’s infrastructure, or perhaps you would like to propose a certain date for a field trip. Will the entire class go to the principal? It would clearly not be practical. In many schools, classes have a ‘class monitor’ or ‘class representative’, whom the whole class elected; even if there is none, one representative can be selected for this specific purpose. It will be enough to send the representative to the principal. It is the same principle at the State or national levels ̶ through elections, people vote for representatives, who will be the elected members of their respective assemblies. They are generally called ‘Members of Legislative Assembly’ (or MLAs) at the State level, and ‘Member of Parliament’ (or MPs) at the national level.

The class discusses the pros and cons — distance, time, cost, availability of basic facilities, etc. It becomes difficult to arrive at a decision.

The Child-Friendly Panchayat Initiative creates opportunities for children to express their ideas and opinions on matters that concern their wellbeing. Steps are being taken in several States to encourage the participation of children in Bal Sabhas and Bal Panchayats on a regular basis, while village elders try to find solutions to their concerns. In Maharashtra, for example, a few Bal Panchayats have worked to eliminate child labour and child marriage. They have brought many children back to school. The Bal Panchayat members get together to convince parents and other adults to send their wards back to school, and not to arrange marriages for girls who should be studying. Several Gram Panchayats have won awards for taking child-friendly initiatives.

The Panchayat Samiti at the block level is the link between the Gram Panchayat and the Zila Parishad at the district level. The members of these institutions are elected by the local people, but they may have other members like Sarpanchs of the villages in the area and local members of the State Legislative Assembly. The composition of the Panchayat Samitis differs from State to State, but their role in strengthening the participation of local people remains the same. They coordinate matters across Gram Panchayats, for instance, by collecting development plans from all Gram Panchayats and putting them together to present them at the District or State levels respectively. This facilitates the allotment of funds for such development projects and for government schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, which promotes the construction of all-weather roads in rural areas.

The secondary sector includes the construction of buildings, roads, etc., and providing utilities like water, electricity, gas and other such necessities. It also includes the manufacturing of products in factories and production units to process raw material from the primary sector into some other form that can be further sold or consumed. Some examples of secondary sector activities include the processing of grains obtained from agricultural fields to make flour in mills, extraction of oil from groundnut and processing of tea leaves to derive tea. Similarly, wood from the forest is converted into furniture and paper, cotton is used to make clothes, and steel from iron ore is used to make automobiles like cars, trucks, etc. Automobile factory Textile factory Secondary sector: The group of activities that involves processing of raw materials derived from primary sector into products for sale or consumption.

These include services that we may not be able to see but which still play a very important role. For example, the driver of a truck transports grains and vegetables from the farm to a factory or the market. The fruit or vegetable vendors sell the farm produce to household consumers. Similarly, doctors, nurses, teachers, lawyers and pilots provide their services to those who need them. There are technicians who repair and service electronic items including mobile phones and televisions, mechanics who repair vehicles like cars and tractors, and electricians who ensure regular supply of electricity. Their services make our lives easier.

Let us go on an imaginary excursion to a village in Anand district of Gujarat to study an interesting example where we will understand how the three sectors are interconnected and support each other. Dairy: A place where milk is collected and stored. Services at airports Retail stores Dairy cooperative: from farm to plate These days, farmers in Gujarat greet the day with the clinking of milk pails and the happy moos of their best friends, their cows or buffaloes! Cows have a special place in the lives of the farmers and their families. The farmers milk the cows and sell their milk to the dairy nearby. At the end of the month, they get paid for the milk based on its quantity and quality. However, this was not the case about 50 years ago. This is the amazing story of a milk cooperative named Anand Milk Union Limited (AMUL). In the early 1940s, farmers in Anand district would sell milk to the neighbouring villages. Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 6__sst__p223__c1", "text": "203 14 ― Economic Activities Around Us Cooperative: A group of people who voluntarily come together to meet their economic and social needs in a formal way. They own the cooperative and decisions are taken by the members collectively. Middlemen: Persons who buy goods from producers and sell them to consumers. The middlemen charge a fee for this service. They would have to cycle or walk to nearby villages to sell the milk under scorching heat. As you know, milk spoils or curdles very fast in hot weather. The farmers had to sell the milk quickly before it could spoil. This was a lot of effort for the small amount of money they would earn. So, they depended on people called middlemen, who would buy the milk in bulk at meagre prices from the farmers and sell it in the market. Many times, the farmers felt cheated and harassed by the middlemen. One day, the farmers collectively approached Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, a prominent national leader, with their problems. He advised them to form a cooperative to become independent and stop relying on the middlemen. As a cooperative, the farmers would be able to buy and sell milk as a group, taking care of the entire operation of milk collection, processing and distribution themselves. The farmers took Sardar Patel’s advice. AMUL was set up in 1946 under the leadership of Tribhuvandas Patel (lawyer and freedom fighter) and Dr. Varghese Kurien (an engineer who was working at a dairy factory in Mumbai).

{"id": "class 6__sst__p224__c1", "text": "204 Exploring Society: India and Beyond Economic Life Around Us This initiative brought farmers, including women, together and gave them control over the production and sale of milk. The milk producers collectively made their own decisions on all matters such as production, pasteurisation and sale of milk. The tasks were shared by everyone, which helped raise their income gradually. They did not need the middlemen anymore and became like one big family! As more and more farmers began to see the benefits of the cooperative, it continued to grow. The quantity of milk that was being collected was so huge that the farmers decided to make other products out of it. They set up a factory in Anand, and began to produce butter and milk powder. Today, the cooperative has a wide range of products made at many milk processing plants and factories all over India. Can you name a few? The products are then transported and sold in both small and large retail shops all over the country. In fact, they also export the products to several countries around the world. Is it not amazing? In this fascinating story, the farmers of this cooperative milk their cows to sell the milk later. This kind of economic activity is called a primary sector economic activity because the product (milk) is derived directly from a natural source (cows/livestock). Pasteurisation: A process by which milk is preserved through heating to a specific temperature to kill harmful bacteria. Factory: Building or group of buildings where goods are manufactured, or various components are put together, to make a final product. Retail: The sale of goods in small quantities for use by the end consumer rather than for resale.

Milk is then processed and converted from one form (liquid) into another — milk powder, ghee, cheese, butter and many others in the factories. These economic activities are called secondary sector economic activities. What does AMUL do with all the products it makes? It sells them in various places. AMUL uses lorries and trucks, as well as railway, air and shipping services, to transport its products. It has set up retail stores and supplies milk and milk products to other shops in towns, cities and villages all over Gujarat, as well as in different states across India.

{"id": "class 6__vocational education__p3__c1", "text": "Foreword The National Education Policy 2020 envisages a system of education in the country that is rooted in Indian ethos and its civilisational accomplishments in all domains of human endeavour and knowledge, while at the same time preparing the students to constructively engage with the prospects and challenges of the 21st century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured the students’ inherent abilities and touching upon all the five planes of human existence, the pañchakośhas, in the Foundational and the Preparatory Stages have paved the way for the progression of their learning further at the Middle Stage. Thus, the Middle Stage acts as a bridge between the Preparatory and the Secondary Stages, spanning three years from Grade 6 to 8. The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages, including at least two languages native to India, Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education, promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy— a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establishing conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks.

{"id": "class 6__vocational education__p4__c1", "text": "iv Kaushal Bodh, the Activity Book of Vocational Education for Grade 6, is one of these. Its content comprises projects related to three work forms— life forms, machines and materials, and human services. The projects will help students to develop knowledge, skills, attitude and values alongside ecological sensitivity, gender sensitivity, digital skills, and life skills. For all practical purposes, it has, to my mind, succeeded in its curricular goals: first, to foster natural curiosity among students through a proper selection of project; and second, develop among them the core competencies, such as communication, creativity, critical thinking and green skill and vocational skills, such as application of tools, and procedures for design and developing products by intelligently designing various activities, thereby seamlessly integrating content and pedagogy within meaningful contexts. However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries, laboratories and workshops play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this activity book and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years. \b Dinesh Prasad Saklani Director New Delhi National Council of Educational July, 2024 Research and Training Reprint 2025-26"}

In the National Curriculum Framework 2023 (NCF-SE 2023), work has been categorised under three broad forms: work with life forms, work with machines and materials, and work in human services. The intent at this stage is to provide vocational exposure to the students through a wide range of activities categorised into three forms of work. To achieve this, students are expected to take up nine projects across Grades 6 to 8, i.e., three projects in each Grade and one from each form of work. The textual material developed for the Middle Stage will take children well beyond the Preparatory Stage. Curricular goals, competencies, and learning outcomes have been the guiding principles while developing the textbook. The following Curricular Goals (CG) given in the activity book cover a range of competencies. CG-1: Develops in-depth basic skills and allied knowledge of work and their associated materials or procedures; CG-2: Understands the place and usefulness of vocational skills and vocations in the world of work; CG-3: Develops essential values while working across areas; and CG-4: Develops basic skills and allied knowledge to run and contribute to a home. A variety of activities have been included in the Activity Book to cover the above curricular goals. The Activity Book contains six illustrative projects, two for each form of work. One project maybe taken up by students or preferably, the school can design other projects based on local considerations. The illustrative projects are described as follows: Project 1 is on developing a School Kitchen Garden. Students will engage in creating and maintaining a kitchen garden on school grounds or in pots.

Project 2 is on preparing a biodiversity register. Students will be studying a variety of life within the school premises or nearby areas and documenting the various living things. They will learn to identify different species of plants, animals, and insects, understanding their roles in the ecosystem. This project will enhance their observational skills, knowledge of biodiversity, and the significance of conservation. It will also instill a sense of environmental stewardship and the importance of protecting natural habitats. Project 3 is on Maker Skills.

{"id": "class 6__vocational education__p14__c1", "text": "Approach and Principles This Activity Book is designed to align with the approach to Vocational Education outlined in the National Curriculum Framework 2023 (NCF-SE 2023). In the NCF-SE 2023, work has been categorised in three broad forms: Work with Life Forms, Work with Machines and Materials, and Work in Human Services. • Work with Life Forms involves working with plants and animals. For example, developing a vegetable garden and taking care of animals. • Work with Machines and Materials involves working with materials (such as, paper, wood, clay and fabric) and using basic tools (such as, scissors and garden fork, knife, hammer, screwdriver, etc.) and machines (such as, bottle opener, ramp slide, wood screw, crane, bulldozer, etc.) • Work in Human Services involves interaction with people to understand their needs and how we can help them. It involves communication and understanding the processes and resources for providing a particular service. For example, healthcare, social services, education, food services, community service, etc. These ‘Forms of Work’ act as a guiding concept for developing the curriculum, syllabus and materials for the Middle Stage (Grades 6 to 8). The intent at this stage is to provide students exposure to a wide range of work. To achieve this, students are required to take up nine projects across Grades 6 to 8: three projects, one from each form of work, in each Grade. The choice of projects is left entirely to schools. The NCF-SE 2023, and indeed this Activity Book, encourages schools to select projects based on local considerations and availability of resources. Two examples each of projects from the Forms of Work that students can take up in Grade 6 are detailed in the Activity Book. It must be emphasised that these examples are meant to serve as illustrations of how projects can be designed and the key aspects that must be addressed. To this end, a template for designing a project other than the examples has also been provided in the Activity Book (Annexure 1). Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 6__vocational education__p15__c1", "text": "xv The following principles have informed the design of this Activity Book: 1. Smooth introduction to Vocational Education: This is the first time that Vocational Education will be introduced in the Middle Stage. The Activity Book must aim to make this transition as smooth as possible without prescribing to either the teacher or the student. 2. Illustrations of projects requiring varied resources: The Activity Book must illustrate projects that can be taken up by schools with different kinds of resources in terms of availability of experts as well as tools and materials. 3. Alignment to learning outcomes: The Activity Book must be designed to ensure attainment of the learning outcomes for Grade 6 and eventually the competencies for the Middle Stage. 4. Consistency across projects: The same format must be followed across all projects. This will ensure that each project presents a familiar sequence and outcomes. 5. Coherence within projects: While projects will comprise various activities, all these activities must lead to learning how to ‘do’ something. In other words, the activities must be linked and lead to progression of learning. 6. Ownership of students: The Activity Book must ‘speak’ to students. It must also give them opportunities to record their own learning and reflection based on the activities they will take up. 7. Guidance for teachers: The Activity Book must provide a framework for teachers who will be taking up Vocational Education for the first time. It must guide them in their expectations from students. It must also guide them to understand what is expected from them in the NCF-SE 2023. 8. Value integration: The Activity Book must offer students opportunities to ‘do’ different things, record small successes, take and give feedback, work with peers, try and re-try, answer questions, reflect, in short, and ‘experience’ the values related to work. 9. Approach of conducting projects: The focus must be on ‘doing’ with some element of preparation, and recording and reflections. Learning should emerge from the process of doing the activities. To this end, as far as possible, the initial activities must be rooted in what students are doing at present and what they can easily observe around themselves. Reprint 2025-26"}

{"id": "class 6__vocational education__p17__c1", "text": "Note for Teachers and School Heads Teachers are pivotal to achieving the goals set out in the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 introduces Vocational Education as a distinct subject starting in Grade 6. The purpose of this subject is to promote ‘learning by doing’, ‘dignity of labour’, and the development of vocational capacities through exposure to a wide range of work. Successful implementation will aid in developing responsible and confident adults who value all professions. Vocational Education in schools also offers a robust medium for holistic learning by offering students opportunities to apply conceptual learning in other curricular areas to real-life situations. In Grade 6, students will take up one project in each of the ‘Forms of Work’. The sequence of these projects is not important, so long as all the projects are completed within the academic year. These projects can be taken up at the same time or one after the other. Groups of students may also take up different projects, which depends on the nature of the project and other factors, such as the number of students, resources available, and so on. Please note that it is important to identify concepts across curricular areas that students need to know (e.g., life cycle of plants and biodiversity in the project on Life Forms) and ensure that they have been covered before starting the project. In this Activity Book, the projects are designed as per the Learning Outcomes for Vocational Education in Grade 6. The focus is on the following: 1. Using physical tools/equipment for carrying out different processes to perform authentic tasks. 2. Gaining clarity about what is to be done and reaching the final outcome through breaking down the task into smaller activities. 3. Understanding how to prepare materials and use tools and equipment, while following safety measures and protocols. 4. Connecting the activities done in school to the world of work. 5. Assessing work done in terms of quantity and quality. 6. Applying what is learnt in school to daily life. 7. Working collaboratively in groups while ensuring individual participation in each activity. Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 6__vocational education__p18__c1", "text": "xviii In doing the above, students will be able to develop values related to work, particularly respect for all work. They will realise the importance of the dignity of labour, which means that no work is considered superior and therefore, no work or person should be discriminated against on any basis. Pedagogy and Assessment Projects comprise a set of activities that are generally expected to be completed in a group or individually, as required. Resources for projects (e.g., tools, equipment, materials, use of workspaces, etc.) and resource persons or master instructors (e.g., mechanics, farmers, craftspersons, artisans, persons working in technology, and experts in the field) must be drawn from the community. Exposure visits and interactions with professionals are built into the project to enable students to observe and understand work in real settings. The total time allotted to Vocational Education is 110 hours or 165 periods in one academic year, excluding time for assessment, school events, bagless days and similar activities (Section 4.3 of the NCF-SE 2023). These periods may be distributed across the week as two blocks of two periods on weekdays and one period on Saturday. Each project is expected to be completed in about 30 hours (approximately 55 periods of 40 minutes each). This duration is to ensure a long-term engagement that allows students to complete a set of interrelated activities. It also gives them time for trial and error, to try out things differently, and to extend their learning into other activities. The focus of the projects must be creativity and demonstration of skills, and the process of ‘doing’ rather than the ‘product’ or outcome. Working in groups and observing people with expertise is important to foster an appreciation for teamwork, creativity, sensitivity, persistence, and other important values related to work. Students must be active throughout, as they take up activities that are directly connected to real life and the world of work. They must be able to integrate learning from other curricular areas into the projects. Prevalent biases must be addressed, for example, by not assigning specific work roles to a particular gender or to students from a specific social groups. All students must participate in all activities. To ensure the participation of students with disabilities, projects can be adapted or an entirely different project maybe developed.

{"id": "class 6__vocational education__p19__c1", "text": "xix The Activity Book is designed to enable continuous assessment by teachers, as well as self and peer-assessment by students. The questions and formats for recording require students to assess their own progress, share their learning and reflections, and record their answers as they move from one activity to the next. Students must also maintain a portfolio in order to help them see their own progress, and record the processes and products related to the projects. It may contain any work done by students, including additional notes, presentations, sketches or photographs (besides those in the Activity Book) related to the project, and products they have created. Students can be continuously assessed by observing them during activities, asking them questions, and reviewing their Activity Books. Assessing the inculcation of values related to work (e.g., initiative, persistence and focus, responsibility, discipline, eye for detail, curiosity and creativity, empathy and sensitivity, and willingness to do physical work) is particularly important. Students must be observed while at work to assess the same. Checklists and rubrics that outline specific behaviours and attitudes related to work values may be developed by the teachers. Annexure 2 contains the competencies to be developed across the Middle Stage and the learning outcomes to be achieved in Grade 6. While this is true for all subjects, the role of feedback is particularly important in Vocational Education. Students must be encouraged and motivated by recognition of their work and their creativity. This approach ensures that all students are able to complete their work successfully through ongoing guidance, which in turn is motivating. Summative assessment for Grade 6 can, for example, comprise a viva voce, presentation, role play, simulation, group discussion, presentations, and the review of students’ responses to prompts or questions in the Activity Book. If you wish to use a paper-pencil test, it could include situational questions, concept maps, flowcharts, questions related to learning from visits, and Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs). Each project also has a set of questions in the last section. These questions address key aspects of learning and concepts that are strengthened while doing the activities. To reiterate, the focus must be on assessing capacities and understanding of processes. Weightage to Reprint 2025-26"}

The projects in this Activity Book are not mandatory, therefore schools are free to choose any one of these from each form of work or design an entirely different project. Students must also be encouraged to come up with ideas for projects. If you and the students decide to choose a project other than those in the Activity Book, the following must be kept in mind for all the Forms of Work: 1. Is the project appropriate for students in Grade 6? 2. Does the project helps students use learning from other subjects? 3. Is the project related to the work the students see around them? 4. Will the students be able to interact with persons who are experts in the work related to the project? 5. Will the students be able to get hands-on experience? 6.

The use of the Internet by the students must be supervised, and they must work in groups. Who will teach? Since the purpose of Vocational Education in the Middle Stage is to provide vocational exposure to students, and till such time that teacher education programmes offer specialisation in Vocational Education, existing teachers will take up the subject in the Middle Stage, with the support of resource persons/master instructors. In the absence of a Vocational Teacher, a teacher of any subject can take the lead in organising activities for projects in which they have some understanding and expertise. The Head of the School may nominate a Teacher Coordinator among the existing teachers to coordinate and schedule the activities of different projects to be undertaken at the Middle Stage.

Another new and exciting subject that you will study is Vocational Education. Vocational Education will help you learn about different kinds of work and how to ‘do’ work yourself. When you think about work, you must remember two things: (i) all work is important, and (ii) people work not only to make a living, but also to make life more joyful and interesting. In daily life, you see people doing various kinds of work. Some of the work is related to running a household while some is related to earning a living. Vocational Education prepares you to deal with practical things related to daily life and understand the world of work. This will happen through projects that you will do in school. These projects will give you an opportunity to work with your hands, work in groups with your peers, and learn the skills which help you become self-dependent in life. How to use the Activity Book? Read through the introduction of the project to get an idea of what you will be doing. Materials Needed Gather all the materials listed at the beginning of each activity. Follow the Steps 1. Each activity has clear, numbered steps. Follow them to complete each task. Take your time and make sure you understand each step before moving on. Take notes during field visits or interaction with experts. 2. Complete all the questions and tables given in the Activity Book, this will help you to both learn and check your understanding.

After finishing an activity, review your work. Make sure you have completed all the steps and check your answers. If the space in the Activity Book is not enough, please use a different notebook or loose sheets, which you can add to the portfolio. Ask for Help If you are unsure about any part of an activity, do not hesitate to ask a teacher, parent, or peers for help. Ask as many questions as needed if something is unclear. Collaboration and discussion can make learning more fun and effective. You can also get help from internet searches or using AI tools. AI stands for Artificial Intelligence and AI tools make our tasks easy by helping us find things or do something quickly. Some examples of AI tools are ChatGPT, tools for translation or for finding information about something. Please note that AI is not necessary for your projects; you can use it if you want. Take Breaks Do not rush through the activities. If you start feeling tired, take a short break. Be Creative Some activities may have open-ended questions or ask for your creative inputs. Let your imagination flow. Stay Positive Learning new things can be challenging. Stay positive and remember that practice makes you perfect. Reflect Think about what you have learned from each activity. Share your progress with peers and teachers and ask for their feedback.

Discuss your observations with your peers and teacher, and write about what you learnt about growing plants after your visit. Did you know? The science of agriculture and plant life was given a lot of importance in ancient Bharat as the main work was farming and the rearing of animals. The distilled wisdom and experience related to plant health, growth and treatment of diseases was documented in a treatise called ‘Vrikshayurveda’ (Ayurveda for trees). There were two texts by the same name of Vrikshayurveda, one written by Salihotra (approximately 400 BCE) and the second one by Surapala (1000 CE). The only existing copy of a palm leaf manuscript of Surapala’s Vrikshayurveda is preserved at Oxford University. The text deals with the cultivation of many species of plants, water management, soil conservation, fertilisers, various diseases affecting plants and their treatment. In the Vrikshayurveda, Surapala encourages the planting of sacred trees like Bilva (Bael or stone apple), Nyagrodha (banyan), Ashwattha (fig) and Neem. The text says that planting trees is one of the means to attain the goals of human life. Climate change, soil erosion and increasing health concerns have led to renewed interest in the traditional knowledge contained in texts like Vrikshayurveda. This knowledge can be used to maintain the health of the soil, promote good agricultural practices and preserve biodiversity. Reprint 2025-26"}

What factors did you consider when selecting a location for the garden? ................................................................................................................ ................................................................................................................ ............................................................................................................... ................................................................................................................ Plants need nutrients to grow. Nutrients refer to specific elements, such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potash that plants absorb from the soil or growth medium for their growth and development. Organic fertilisers, such as manure, compost, vermicompost and green manure and inorganic fertilisers, such as urea and superphosphate are applied to the plants for supplying nutrients. You can consider planting herbs or leafy vegetables that grow quickly. For example, you can grow herbs, like coriander, mint, spinach or leafy vegetables so that you can use the produce from your garden soon. These herbs and leafy vegetables are also very good for health as they are good source of vitamins and minerals. Now, select the plants for your kitchen garden and get the seeds or seedlings for sowing or planting. Activity 3: Making vermicompost In this activity, you will learn how to make vermicompost. There are many methods of preparing vermicompost. One such method is described below. You can also search for other methods on the Internet or ask farmers and other experts for advice. 1. Vermicompost is prepared in a bin made of plastic, wood or any other water-resistant material. The bin must be covered with tarpaulin or piece of old thick cloth. Holes must be made in its bottom to drain out extra water. 2. The compost bin should be filled with waste, such as kitchen waste, fallen leaves and other garden waste or any Reprint 2025-26"}

You can use any organic waste from the midday meal in your school, or bring it from home or a nearby Dhaba or restaurant. These layers of waste are called ‘bedding materials’. 3. Now add water to moisten the bedding material. Do this as per the instructions of the teacher. 4. Red earthworms (Eisenia fetida) should be introduced on top of the bedding material and allowed to burrow into it (Figure 1.7a). You can get them from a farm or nursery. 5. The earthworms must be fed by adding kitchen scraps, such as fruit and vegetable peelings, coffee grounds, eggshells, and non-greasy food waste to the bin. Avoid adding meat, dairy or oily foods, and citrus fruits, as they can attract pests or harm the worms. 6. The bedding should be kept moist by spraying it with water as needed, but not waterlogged. It should be covered with a lid to retain moisture and prevent pests. 7. Vermicompost from the bottom of the bin can be used once it becomes dark, crumbly, and earthy smelling, which usually happen within a few months (Figure 1.7b).

Before planting seeds, read the instructions on the seed packets to understand the recommended planting depth, spacing, and season for planting. You can also use farm seeds preserved from the previous harvest by farmers or gardeners, in which case please ask them for guidance. If you are transplanting seedlings, read any labels or tags that came with them for specific care instructions. If labels or tags are not available, ask the person who gave you the seedlings for guidance. 1. Sowing Seeds Sow seeds as per the sequence below: (a) Make furrows or small holes in the soil according to the recommended spacing for sowing the seeds. If you are making your kitchen garden in pots, you will have to know the number of seeds or seedlings to be placed in each pot. The number of seeds or seedlings to be placed in each pot is decided by certain factors, including the type of plant, the size of pot and the desired plant growth. (b) Drop seeds into the furrows or holes. If the seeds are very small, sprinkle them evenly over the soil surface (Figure 1.9). (c) Cover the seeds lightly with soil, following the recommended planting depth. (d) Gently pat down the soil to ensure good seed-to-soil contact.

The hole should be slightly larger than the length of the roots of the seedlings. (b) Carefully remove seedlings from their containers, being mindful not to damage the roots. (c) Place each seedling into the prepared hole. The soil level around the seedling should match the soil level in its original container. (d) Gently fill the holes with soil, pressing lightly around the base of each seedling to secure the plant in its place. Write the name of the plant and date of sowing on labels with the help of a permanent marker. These labels can be made of old plastic bags stuck on waste cardboard or even chart paper. Place the labels at the beginning of each row or section of the garden or in each pot to identify the date they were planted. This will help you keep track of your plants as they grow.

General protection of plants include making a fence, companion planting, sanitation, weeding, wind protection, and using organic pesticides against pests and diseases. 1. Making a fence You need to keep the plants safe from other animals and people who may step on them. You can do this by making a fence around your kitchen garden. (a) The fence can be made using bamboo or locally available material. (b) Measure the dimensions of the area that needs to be fenced. (c) Draw a sketch of the area and decide where fence is to be placed. (d) Collect locally available materials, like bamboo, old pipes or old wooden sticks for using them as ‘poles’ and use a strong string to bind the poles and make the fence. Reprint 2025-26"}

Steps for Plant Care and Maintenance (a) Support your plants and creepers by staking: Staking plants is a common practice to provide support and stability, especially for tall or weak stem plants that may otherwise become top-heavy and fall over (Figure 1.11). Plants, such as tomatoes, cucumbers, peas and beans require staking. First, you will need ‘stakes’. You can use bamboo, a thin old branch that has fallen off a tree, or an old metal or plastic pipe as a stake. The height and thickness of the stake should be decided according to the length and weight of the plant. Now, using a string tie the plant with the stake.

Decide how the plants will be watered. You can use, a mug and bucket, watering can, or a pipe or something else (Figure 1.12). Develop a schedule to ensure plants receive sufficient water, especially during dry spells. New plants need more frequent watering. Water the plants in early morning or late afternoon to minimise water loss due to evaporation.

Figure 1.13: Removing weeds in a plant bed using hand cultivator 1. Take 500 gram of neem leaves (if possible, you can ask an expert at the local Krishi Vigyan Kendra or Agriculture Research Centre to recommend any other bitter plant leaves), wash them and chop or break them into smaller pieces. You will experience a nice fragrance as the leaves are broken up. 2. Mix the neem leaves with 5 litres of water. 3. Put the mixture in a jerry can/large size bottle and leave it for around 14 days. 4. Separate suspended solids from liquid using a strainer. 5. You can spray this pesticide on your plants using a spray bottle. Decorate Your Garden Your garden must look beautiful with plants growing neatly in rows and with proper layout and decoration. Think of ways in which you can beautify your garden and act on them. Some things you can do to decorate your kitchen garden are as follows: 1. Use stones to make the flower beds or pots look neat. You can paint these stones using attractive colours. 2. Make decorative items that can be kept outside in the garden, like painted clay pots, paintings made on stones, or using old objects lying around the school to make ‘sculptures’. 3. You can even make a scarecrow to keep the garden safe from birds.

{"id": "class 6__vocational education__p63__c1", "text": "35 Biodiversity Register The diversity of living things, known as biodiversity, comprises the variety of life forms on earth. It includes plants, animals, birds, fish, insects, and even microorganisms that are found everywhere, including soil (see Figure 2.1). You have learnt about the diversity of living things around us in Science. A biodiversity register is used for documenting the diversity of living things in an area. It contains information about habitat, which includes the landscape and types of soil, scientific and local names of living things, what animals eat, living things that may harm others, and other different kinds of information. Recording biodiversity is crucial because as habitats transform due to factors, such as land clearance for construction or agriculture, or shifts in climate, many species face extinction or become endangered. This interconnectedness means that the loss of any plant or species affects the ecosystems, including humans. Biodiversity registers also provide people with information that is useful, for example, local knowledge related to crop plants and animals, plants that can be used for their medicinal value, pests that affect plants, when to plant crops, and so on. You can create your own ‘mini’ biodiversity register by systematically recording the biodiversity around yourself. In case you come across a plant, insect, bird or animal that you are not familiar with, then you can get information by: i. Talking to teachers/elders/family members/experts ii. Looking up books in the library iii. Searching for the information with the help of the Internet on the computer iv. Using applications on mobile phones. Terms used in the biodiversity register Scientific name: A name given to living things that is the same across languages. Names differ across languages, but a scientific name ensures that people, especially scientists know that they are referring to the same living thing. Reprint 2025-26"}

Cropping season: It is the season in which a particular crop is grown. Season of fruiting: This refers to the season when fruit trees produce fruits. Source of seeds/plants: This refers to how new plants grow, whether from seeds, seedlings, bulbs, stem cuttings or any other method. Affected crop: Crop that had been damaged by pests, e.g., diseases that affect plants, insects that eat the leaves or fruits, or any other reason. Host: It is a plant or animal on which other plants or animals live. For example, dogs are hosts for fleas, who suck their blood, and some plants are hosts for caterpillars, who grow by eating leaves and fruits. Pests: These are insects, birds or animals that are harmful to plants. Pesticide: Pesticides are used to prevent or control harm to hosts by pests. They can be in the form of liquid, solid or gases. Weedicide: Weedicides are used to prevent or control harm to plants by weeds. GI tag: A Geographical Indication (GI) tag is given by the government and recognised all over the world. For plants, it means that the plant is grown in a specific geography and all the produce from that area is of a high standard. For example, we have many varieties of rice in our country – some with GI tags are Navara rice from Kerala, Basmati from Uttarakhand, and Gobind Bhog rice from West Bengal. Another example is of Jalgaon bananas from Maharashtra. What will I be able to do? At the end of the project, you will be able to: 1.

Look around and observe the living things you can spot. You will find that each one of the plants supports a tiny cosmos full of insects, spiders, squirrels, birds, and other creatures that feed on it and seek shelter amongst its leaves and branches (Figure 2.2). You will record some of your observations and related information in your biodiversity register. Before you begin writing on your biodiversity register, complete table 2.1. This will help you in remembering the living organisms you often observe and where you see them (e.g., near a water body, in a farmland, or in a park).

The person is a practitioner of traditional tribal medicine, since they use medicinal herbs and other related plants. You must prepare questions to ask the experts. Some examples are as follows: 1. Where can we find different kinds of plants in our locality? 2. How do we know whether the plants growing in the locality have been there for a long time or were brought from other places? 3. Are there plants that are no longer found in the locality? 4. Which kind of plants should we be growing more to support biodiversity? 5.

Learning on the Internet You can look up the steps to make the toys given in the Activity Book by searching on the Internet with the search keywords: ‘DIY + XX (name of toy)’ (DIY means ‘Do It Yourself’). If you want to see videos, you can add the word ‘video’ to the search keywords. Internet safety Ask your teacher for help while using the Internet, be careful not to upload or download anything, and do not share personal information anywhere. Activity 2: Using levers to make toys A lever is a fixed bar or handle that moves around a fixed point, called the hinge/fulcrum. A simple example of using a lever is when you use a spoon to open the lid of a tin. The tip of the spoon is fixed under the lid, and you apply force at the other end. Another example is that of a seesaw in the playground. Some toys you can make using a lever are catapult, lazy tongs and robotic arm scissors. The simple catapult you will make has a single lever while the lazy tongs and robotic arms have multiple levers.

You will now explore how simple machines are used to create a bigger machine. A bicycle is made using different simple machines, such as wheels, wheels and axles, levers and pulleys (Figure 3.10). In this activity, you will learn about the parts of a bicycle and how to keep them functioning. Bicycles have many moving parts that work together to accomplish a task (Table 3.2). All the parts (wheels, gears, pedal, etc.) of a bicycle work together to transform the effort of a rider into motion. Figure 3.10: Parts of a bicycle Table 3.2: Parts of a bicycle and their function Part Function Brake Pads They are placed around wheels and they grab them to resist their motion.

They allow the wheel to spin around the axle. Kickstand It enables the bicycle to stand upright. Cycle light It improves visibility and safety. Pedals These are the point of contact for the rider’s feet to apply force. Rims They support the tyres, and provide braking surface (rim brakes). Saddle This is where the rider sits. Seatpost This connects the saddle to the frame, usually of adjustable height. Spokes They connect the rim to the hub and provide strength and stability. Tyres They provide traction and cushioning. Some common problems and solutions related to bicycles are: 1. Rusting of parts: You can clean the parts using sandpaper and apply oil or paint, as appropriate. 2. Loose parts: You can fix them using the appropriate tools.

You might have wondered how these games, animojis or videos of moving figures (both humans and animals) and objects are made. People called ‘programmers’ use something called ‘coding’ to do this. This project will help you create your own online games and animations. Designing games and animations require a blend of creativity and technology. It all begins with an idea. Designers then develop and refine their ideas before they actually start the work. This is made possible by artists who create visual elements, and programmers who do the coding. You can create your own animations and games using ‘Scratch’ (Figure 4.2).

These blocks allow you ‘write’ programmes to create animated figures, design games, and create your own wallpaper (Figure 4.3). Coding allows us to communicate with computers and smartphones. When you click on a button and the computer or smartphone responds, your click is translated into instructions in a language the machine understands. A series of instructions to computers or smartphones are called a programme. There are many languages with which you can communicate with computers, like Javascript, Python and C++. Among these languages, there are visual programming languages in which a series of programming instructions are clubbed into ‘blocks’.

Storyboard A storyboard helps in planning what will be shown on the screen during a game or animation. It is like a roadmap. You can make it on paper or use the computer to create a document with the details of your plan. You can sketch your characters, detail how they will respond to commands, and show the sequence of actions, in short. Everything that is in your head can go into the storyboard. Making a storyboard is important to ensure a detailed plan so that you do not have to stop and think as you start making your game or animation. Reprint 2025-26"}

Among these sources are artefacts, objects made by humans that are old, unique and beautiful and related to our traditions and culture. These artefacts can be ancient or a part of our lives and societies in the present. A museum is a place in which artefacts are kept. Museums help us understand our history and culture (Figure 5.1). They show us what ancient people wore, what kind of work they did, what kind of artwork they created (e.g., paintings and sculptures), and what they wrote (manuscripts). Museums help us build the past in our minds, and see things, which we may never be able to otherwise. Museums also help us to learn about the present culture and work of different groups of people in the country and the world. They display artefacts related to art, traditions (Figure 5.2), architecture, and science. For example, the National Science Centres/Museums spread across India help us to learn about things that no longer exist, such as dinosaurs, and also about things that we can expect in the future. There are even some curious objects that defy what we think or we know, like a 1200 kg granite ball that spins on water at the National Science Centre in Delhi.

Work with your peers to take responsibility for five artefacts for the museum. Discuss and finalise a brief description of each of the artefacts. Write the final descriptions neatly on labels. Discuss how these labels will be placed, whether on display boards or pasted on charts next to the artefacts (table 5.3). 3. Set up tables, stands, and display boards. Ensure artefacts are securely displayed and labelled. 4. Create posters, flyers, and social media posts to promote the exhibition. 5. Send out invitations to parents, family, friends, school staff and community members. Invite your friends and family. 6.

{"id": "class 6__vocational education__p154__c1", "text": "126 Kaushal Bodh— Grade 6 We all enjoy eating! Some of us also enjoy cooking. Cooking involves many methods like boiling, baking, steaming, grilling and frying. Raw food is heated to a high temperature, which changes the food, kills germs, improves texture and flavour, and makes it tastier and easier to eat. We often use a gas or other type of stove for cooking — the heat cooks the food. We also use different utensils, depending on what we are preparing. But did you know that we can cook without fire as well? Additionally, we also eat some foods without heating. Besides raw fruits, we eat certain raw vegetables. Only those vegetables that do not need cooking to be edible, can be eaten raw. For instance, can you eat raw potatoes? Raw vegetables maintain their maximum nutritional value since they are not exposed to heat, which can break down nutrients. Preparing food items and dishes without the use of fire or heat opens up a world of creativity and nutrition. The use of fresh, uncooked ingredients to create healthy meals involves techniques, for making salads and refreshing smoothies to inventive dips and desserts, and the possibilities are endless. This approach not only preserves the nutritional value of the ingredients but also encourages a closer connection to the food we consume, promoting mindful eating and a healthy lifestyle. Cooking also gives pleasure and develops a sense of pride. It also helps us to understand the importance of teamwork and cooperation as people who work in kitchen, like chef, cook, specialist cook, dish washer, kitchen porter and others have to work together. Do you help out when someone is cooking at home? Nutritional Value of Food You must have learnt about different components of food, nutritional value, balanced diet and related concepts in Science. A diet rich in essential nutrients, especially those coming from raw fruits and vegetables, helps us in maintaining a healthy body and mind. Reprint 2025-26"}
