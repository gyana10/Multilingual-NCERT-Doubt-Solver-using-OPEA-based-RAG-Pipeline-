{"id": "class 8__eng__p3__c1", "text": "FOREWORD The National Education Policy 2020 envisages a system of education in the country that is rooted in Indian ethos and its civilisational accomplishments in all domains of human endeavour and knowledge, while at the same time preparing students to constructively engage with the prospects and challenges of the twenty-first century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured students’ inherent abilities, touching upon all the five planes of human existence, the pañchakośas in the Foundational and the Preparatory Stages have paved the way for the progression of their learning further at the Middle Stage. Thus, the Middle Stage acts as a bridge between the Preparatory and the Secondary Stages, spanning three years from Grade 6 to Grade 8. The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow as they advance in lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects in three languages—including at least two languages native to India—Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy—a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. Poorvi, the English language textbook for Grade 8 is one of these. Its content comprises stories, poems, and narratives that ensure a reflection of their social, cultural, and geographical landscapes wherein students are sure to find traces of their lived experiences."}
{"id": "class 8__eng__p4__c1", "text": "iv Poorvi also weaves into its contents snippets from the vast treasure-trove of Indian Knowledge Systems, India’s artistic and cultural heritage, and embeds values alongside ecological sensitivity, gender equality, digital skills, etc. For all practical purposes, it has, to my mind, succeeded in its Curricular Goals: first, to foster natural curiosity among students through a proper selection of content, and second, develop among them the core competencies in listening, speaking, reading, and writing by intelligently designing various activities around them, thereby seamlessly integrating vocabulary and grammar within meaningful contexts. However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook, and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years. Dinesh Prasad Saklani Director New Delhi National Council of Educational May 2025 Research and Training"}
{"id": "class 8__eng__p5__c1", "text": "Poorvi, textbook of English for Grade 8, has been developed in alignment with the vision of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023. Language education is essential for effective communication, aesthetic expression, and appreciation. Reasoning and critical thinking are closely linked with language use, and these are valuable capacities to be developed. Language development plays an important role in the development of perceptual and practical concepts, and also enables us to check our experiences with others to ensure that we have a shared meaning emerging from these experiences. The textual material developed for the Middle Stage will take children well beyond the Preparatory Stage. Curricular Goals, competencies, and learning outcomes have been the guiding principles in developing the textbook. The Curricular Goals (CG) cover a range of competencies. The NCF-SE 2023 has stated the following Curricular Goals: CG-1: Develops independent reading, comprehension, and summarising skills of a variety of texts (stories, poems, extracts of plays, essays, articles, and news reports). CG-2: Attains the ability to write about thoughts, feelings, and experiences of social events. CG-3: Develops the capacity for effective communication using language skills for questioning, describing, analysing, and responding. CG-4: Explores different literary devices and forms of literature. CG-5: Develops the ability to recognise basic linguistic aspects (word and sentence structure) and use them in oral and written expression. CG-6: Develops an appreciation of the distinctive features of the language, including its alphabet and script, sounds, rhymes, puns, and other wordplays and games unique to the language (pp. 245–246). The Curricular Goals have been covered through a variety of themes and an array of activities. There are five thematic units that comprise stories, poems, conversations, and narrative and descriptive pieces. Themes, such as wit and wisdom, values and dispositions, mystery and magic, environment, and science and curiosity have been included. Cross-cutting themes, such as Indian Knowledge Systems, values, heritage, gender sensitivity, and inclusion have been integrated into all the units. Each unit has three literary pieces―story, poem, and conversation, or non-fictional writing. There are in-text questions, ‘Let us discuss’ to assess comprehension of the text. The end-of-the-text questions given in ‘Let us think and reflect’ are designed to encourage critical thinking, reasoning, responding, analysing, and more. ABOUT THE BOOK"}
{"id": "class 8__eng__p6__c1", "text": "vi Unit 1—‘Wit and Wisdom’ celebrates intelligence, humour, and critical thinking. ‘The Wit that Won Hearts’ introduces students to the kingdom of Krishnadeva Raya and legendary courtier Tenali Rama known for his wit and problem-solving skills. The poem, ‘A Concrete Example’ by Reginald Arkell highlights irony and satire in everyday situations. A rock garden may be a thing of beauty for someone, and it may not catch the attention of someone else. The play, ‘Wisdom Paves the Way’ presents a thought-provoking scenario where different perspectives lead to unique solutions. It appreciates the role of wisdom, reasoning, and critical thinking in resolving conflicts. Unit 2—‘Values and Dispositions’ emphasises that true strength lies in courage, kindness, and responsibility. ‘A Tale of Valour: Major Somnath Sharma and The Battle of Badgam’ teaches students the values of courage, duty, and patriotism, showing how selflessness and commitment to one’s country can make a lasting impact. The poem, ‘Somebody’s Mother’ by Mary Dow Brine, focuses on values of kindness, empathy, and the importance of helping others. It teaches that small acts of kindness can bring great comfort to those in need. ‘Verghese Kurien – I Too Had a Dream’ encourages young people to not only pursue personal success but also contribute to the greater good of the society, reinforcing the value of serving one’s community with honesty and perseverance. Unit 3—‘Mystery and Magic’ highlights the power of intelligence, the wonders of creativity and the breathtaking marvels of nature. ‘The Case of the Fifth Word’ by Donald J. Sobol emphasises that keen attention to detail and critical thinking can help uncover hidden truths and solve mysteries. The poem, ‘The Magic Brush of Dreams’, revolves around creativity, kindness, and the power of art. The poem teaches that talent should be used for good, emphasising generosity and the impact of imagination in shaping the world. ‘Spectacular Wonders’, explores India’s unique and mysterious natural wonders, highlighting the enigmatic charm that each place unfolds. Unit 4—‘Environment’ encourages students to nurture a bond with nature and express gratitude for the bountiful gifts it offers. ‘The Cherry Tree’ by Ruskin Bond is a story that emphasises the importance of nurturing and the rewards of perseverance. It also teaches us to appreciate the small miracles of life and value our deep connection with nature. The poem, ‘Harvest Hymn’ by Sarojini Naidu, reflects the hardwork of farmers and their deep faith in the land and the divine forces. It signifies the harmony between humans and nature, portraying the harvest as a sacred and joyous occasion. ‘Waiting for the Rain’, by Kamakshi Balasubramanian, is a story that captures the vagaries of nature, and its impact on farming. It also highlights the wisdom in understanding the natural cycle of renewal and balance."}
{"id": "class 8__eng__p7__c1", "text": "vii Unit 5—‘Science and Curiosity’ sparks curiosity about the wonders of science, technology, and discovery. ‘Feathered Friend’ by Arthur C. Clarke explores companionship beyond human relationships through the story of a bird in space. The poem, ‘Magnifying Glass’ by Walter de la Mare, encourages students to explore perception and mystery. ‘Bibha Chowdhuri: The Beam of Light that Lit the Path for Women in Indian Science’ highlights renowned scientists and their contributions, promoting discussions on scientific advancements. These literary pieces serve not only as sources of entertainment but also as repositories of valuable life lessons, fostering personal growth, and equipping children with skills to navigate social situations with confidence. By resonating with children’s daily experiences, the selected pieces promote positive values such as resilience, empathy, and emotional intelligence, thereby exerting a profound impact on their overall development. The primary focus lies in cultivating competencies in listening, speaking, reading, and writing while concurrently developing vocabulary and grammar in context. Language learning truly comes to life when connected to the immediate environment of learners, allowing them to express their thoughts, feelings, and experiences through experiential learning. All the activities are conveniently colour coded under headings, such as ‘Let us discuss’, ‘Let us think and reflect’, ‘Let us learn’, ‘Let us listen’, ‘Let us speak’, ‘Let us write’, and ‘Let us explore’. ‘Let us Explore’ extends learning beyond the text, staying within the unit’s theme. It aims to connect students with the Indian Knowledge System, fostering an appreciation for our rich heritage and culture, encouraging students to delve deeper, engage in meaningful discussions, and broaden their understanding. In-text activities and exercises at the end of each chapter are thoughtfully designed to be engaging, fostering joyful learning experiences while serving as tools for assessment and learning. Illustrations have been carefully crafted to depict the relevant context and enhance comprehension. We sincerely hope that students will enjoy doing these activities, and develop language competencies.

Poorvi The textbook of English for Grade 8 is titled Poorvi after the Indian rāga ‘Poorvi’. This rāga is said to promote harmony and serenity. It is associated with dusk, specifically sunset time (Sandhi Prakash). Each rāga in Indian music carries its own emotional significance and is symbolically connected to certain seasons, times of day, and moods. Rāgas are believed to evoke specific emotions in listeners. Poorvi is an ancient and traditional Hindustani classical rāga that originated in eastern India. It is typically performed during the fourth prahar of the day, between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. It evokes a sense of calmness and contemplation in the journey of learners, symbolising a harmonious blend of traditional and modern learning."}

Among its many illustrious rulers, King Krishnadeva Raya (ruled 1509–29 CE) stood out as a wise and powerful monarch. His reign is often referred to as the Golden Era of the Vijayanagara Empire, a time when art, literature, and architecture flourished. A great patron of learning, Krishnadeva Raya was not only an eminent warrior but also a gifted poet. His works, such as the epic Amuktamalyada and the Sanskrit drama Jambavati Parinayam, are acclaimed even today."}
{"id": "class 8__eng__p19__c1", "text": "Wit and Wisdom 3 Krishnadeva Raya’s court was home to eight celebrated poets, collectively known as the Ashtadiggajas. These poets, including Allasani Peddana and Tenali Ramakrishna, enriched the literary tradition with their masterpieces. Tenali Ramakrishna, in particular, was known for his quick wit and humour, earning him a special place in the king’s court as both a poet and a witty advisor. His clever solutions to seemingly insurmountable problems made him a beloved figure in the empire’s history. Even the wisest rulers face moments of disharmony, and at one such time, the king had a quarrel with his queen, Thirumalambal, over a seemingly trivial matter. For weeks, he did not utter a single word to her, and in his frustration, stopped visiting her altogether. His absence cast a shadow over the palace, and the once cheerful corridors seemed quiet and forlorn. Thirumalambal, distraught and upset, tried her best to resolve the issue but failed. With no other alternative, she insurmountable: undefeatable trivial: unimportant forlorn: lonely distraught: upset decided to seek the help of Tenali Rama, the court’s brilliant and witty poet.

But this needs a well-planned approach, and I may need time to find the right strategy.” The queen, who had placed her last hope in Rama, agreed and thanked him profusely. The next morning, the royal court was bustling with activity. Ministers, scholars, and courtiers filled the courtroom, its intricately carved pillars towering towards the high ceiling. Rays of sunlight streamed through the open windows, illuminating the floor adorned with exquisite rugs. Despite the lively chatter, a tension hung in the air. The king sat on his ornate throne, his expression stern, his sharp eyes scanning the room. It was evident that the unresolved quarrel still gnawed at him."}
{"id": "class 8__eng__p21__c1", "text": "Wit and Wisdom 5 The court discussion was centred on improving paddy cultivation in the empire. One by one, the ministers rose to present their ideas. Some suggested expanding irrigation networks, while others advocated for better manure. Amid these suggestions, Tenali Rama stood quietly at the edge of the court, observing everyone with an amused smile. Finally, the king called upon Rama. The chatter in the court died down as all eyes turned to him. Rama approached the throne, carrying a plateful of paddy seeds. Bowing low, he began, “Your Majesty, I bring you a revolutionary type of paddy seeds. If these are sown, the yield will be three times greater than the current results.” A murmur swept through the room. One of the courtiers, known for his sarcasm, whispered just loud enough to be heard, “I wonder if these are magic seeds! Next, he’ll claim they grow without water.” Another muttered, “Perhaps he found them on the moon!” Snickers rippled through the court. The king frowned, unimpressed. “That sounds absurd,” he muttered. “Such cultivation would need special soil, manure, and pest and insect repellents. If, by chance, something were to go wrong, our farmers would suffer.” Rama smiled, unfazed. “That may be true, Your Majesty, but the real issue lies not with the seeds themselves but with the person who sows them.” yield: (here) harvest sarcasm: mockery snickers: suppressed laughter absurd: illogical unfazed: not worried"}

The king’s eyebrows furrowed. “What is wrong with the person who sows the seeds? Speak clearly, Rama!” he roared. Rama glanced around the court, his sharp gaze meeting the sceptical eyes of the courtiers. “If one were to sow seeds without proper care, no one would reap a good harvest,” he said, pausing for effect. “And what if the person had a habit of yawning while sowing? Wouldn’t the seeds scatter unevenly?” The court erupted into laughter, the earlier sarcasm replaced by genuine amusement. Even the king, caught off guard, sighed and instinctively yawned. Rama watched him keenly, then continued, “Your Majesty, is there anyone in this world who does not yawn? It is as natural as breathing.” The king’s expression shifted as realisation dawned.

A Lesson in Responsibility One bright Monday morning, I woke up to the sounds of birds chirping loudly. For once, I wasn’t late for school. My uniform was neatly laid out, and my homework was already packed in my bag. I felt proud of myself for being so organised. But little did I know, the day would still teach me an important lesson. During the morning assembly, our teacher, Mrs. Rao, announced a surprise Science quiz. My heart skipped a beat. I had studied the chapter a week ago, but I had forgotten to revise it over the weekend. As I sat at my desk with the question paper in front of me, I froze. The questions looked familiar, yet I couldn’t recall the answers clearly. I tried my best to focus, but it wasn’t enough. Later, when the results were announced, I scored much lower than I expected. Disappointed, I spoke to Mrs. Rao after the class. She smiled and said, “It’s not about how much you know but how consistently you prepare. Small efforts add up every day.” Her words stayed with me. From that day on, I made it a habit to revise my lessons regularly, even if there wasn’t an immediate test. Responsibility isn’t just about being on time or finishing tasks—it’s about being ready for what’s unexpected. Now, work in pairs and check () if the following features are present in the narrative essay. 1.

As you listen, fill in the blanks for the following sentences given below by selecting the correct options. Hello everybody! Today I’ll be narrating a story about a quick-witted courtier in the kingdom of Vijayanagara. A renowned scholar, proud of his abilities, once visited the kingdom of Vijayanagara. You see, he wanted to challenge the scholarsinthecourtofKingKrishnadevaRaya.Thecourtscholars did not want to accept the challenge as they were worried of being defeated by the visitor. Besides this, they were also afraid that the king would be angry if they refused to face the scholar. They knew that only the quick-witted Tenali Rama would be able to manage the situation. So, naturally, they asked him for a solution. As expected, Rama told them that he would accept the challenge. The next day, Rama arrived at the palace. Rama and the challenger sat facing each other. There was a bundle wrapped in silk kept near Rama. He placed his hand on the bundle and said to the visitor, “Let us start by discussing the merits of tila-kashta-mahisha-bandhana”. The visitor was taken aback. He had read thousands of works. But he had never heard of this work. He had no idea what to say. The scholar had to accept his defeat. Ashamed, he quietly left the palace. Now, the king was curious to know about the great work Rama had mentioned. Rama smiled and removed the silk cloth. There was a huge bundle of sticks tied with a thick rope! The king was puzzled and asked for an explanation. Rama told him, “O king! til is sesame; kashta is stick, tilakashta means sticks of sesame plants”. Then, displaying the rope Rama said, “This is the rope used to tie a buffalo—mahisha means buffalo, bandhana means the rope used for tying—so, this is tila-kashta-mahisha-bandhana.”"}

Hello everyone! The Rock Garden is a spacious open-air exhibition. It is a proof of human creativity with waste materials. This garden was created by Nek Chand, in 1957. This is the reason the garden is also known as Nek Chand’s Rock Garden. The garden was featured on an Indian postage stamp in 1983 and Nek Chand was awarded the Padma Shri a year later. The Rock Garden is spread across a massive 40-acre wonderland. Do you know why I say this? Well, it is because it has several colourful sculptures and mosaic of art pieces. What is unique about the Rock Garden is that it is divided into three distinct phases. Each area reveals a unique collection of installations including terracotta pots, light fixtures, and even broken toilet pots, that have been transformed into extraordinary masterpieces. You will be surprised to know that the borders of the Rock Garden are lined with around 5,000 statues. The Rock Garden is truly a place that celebrates the best from waste.

At that time, Major Somnath Sharma’s left hand was in plaster, but he insisted on being with his company while in combat. He knew that this mission would be very challenging and told his senior officers, “I know my men better than anyone else, and if they are going into action, they are not going in without me.” These words highlighted his commitment to his men and his country. Before their arrival in Srinagar, there had been unfounded rumours of tribal movement towards the village of Badgam, less than 5 kilometres away from the Srinagar airport. The village was on a higher altitude than the airfield, and access was through the village. Hence, it was important for Indian forces to retain control of the area in order to protect troops and facilitate supplies arriving via air. In reality, the enemy had started arriving in Badgam in small groups to avoid detection. On 03 November 1947, several companies, including Major Somnath Sharma’s D Company, were sent to patrol and assess emerging threats in and around the village. Throughout the day, the valley was eerily silent. Around afternoon, the companies were ordered to return one by one. D company with 90 soldiers was the last, and they were expected to return by 2:00 p.m. When the enemy (tribal guerrilla invaders), under the command of the Pakistani army, saw that only a small group combat: a battle unfounded: not based on reason or facts eerily: in a strange, frightening and mysterious way"}

Their initial attack was met with stiff resistance by Major Somnath and his men. However, Major Somnath correctly visualised that the first attack was just a distraction. Shortly thereafter, a major attack came from another side. By then, Major Somnath Sharma and his 90 soldiers were facing about 500 invaders. The Pakistani invaders sought to capture the Srinagar airfield and its surrounding areas. It was clear to Major Somnath Sharma that defending Srinagar town, the airfield, and the wider valley was indeed difficult until reinforcements arrived. After assessing the situation, he requested air strikes. He bravely laid out ground panels to guide the aircraft towards their target. The aerial attacks were successful in hitting the tribal invaders, but they still outnumbered D Company by almost seven to one, the attack on the positions occupied by Major Somnath’s men continued. Vastly outnumbered and facing devastating fire, Major Somnath Sharma and his men stood resolute.

We are heavily outnumbered. We are under devastating fire. I shall not withdraw an inch but will fight to the last man and the last round”. Just a few minutes later, when he was crouched in a trench next to a machine gun operator, in order to help him load the gun, his position was hit by a mortar shell, killing him instantly. Despite losing their Major and faced with the overwhelming numerical superiority of the enemy, the heroic actions of late Major Somnath Sharma motivated his men to hold on to their position for over six more hours before being overrun by the enemy. Their brave resistance provided time for reinforcements to arrive, including flying in soldiers from the Punjab regiment to Srinagar. The heroic deeds of Major Somnath and his men thoroughly demotivated the enemy, causing more than 300 casualties, including injuring their leader. In many significant ways, D Company’s sacrifice and Major Somnath’s leadership saved Srinagar for India. The 4 KUMAON battalion was awarded the Battle Honour, Srinagar. Major Somnath laid down his life for the nation at the young age of 24. For this act of conspicuous bravery, Major Somnath Sharma was awarded the Param Vir Chakra (PVC).

His father, Major General Amar Nath Sharma, had served the nation with distinction. Young Somnath was also deeply inspired by the valorous tales of the Mahabharata, imparted to him by his grandfather. From his early education at Sherwood College, Nainital, to his rigorous training at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Major Somnath Sharma’s life was a testament to discipline and dedication. Commissioned into the 8th Battalion, 19th Hyderabad Regiment in 1942, he served with distinction during World War II in the Arakan Campaign in Burma, earning mentions in despatches for his bravery. However, it was during the Indo–Pakistan War of 1947–1948, particulary in the battle of Badgam, that the legacy of Major Somnath Sharma was truly forged. The life and sacrifice of Major Somnath Sharma embody the highest ideals of duty, honour, and patriotism. He has been a source of inspiration for soldiers and citizens alike.

I have trouble even remembering! In today’s fast-paced world we have become so addicted to instant communication that we prefer to use a telephone. But speaking on the telephone only gives us an immediate but fleeting joy. Writing is different. Writing— even if it is a letter—not only conveys our present concerns and views of the events taking place around us but it becomes a possession that can be treasured and re-read over the years, with great, abiding pleasure. You may not wish to read it all right away but, perhaps, a couple of decades or more from now, you will pick up these jottings of mine again and they will give you a deeper understanding of what I have done, and the reasons I pursued a life of service to our nation’s farmers. You will then discover in them a valuable reminder of the days just before the world entered the twenty-first century. And you may want to share my memories with those of your generation, or even younger, to provide a glimpse of the world your grandparents lived in and knew. I started my working life soon after our country became independent. The noblest task in those days was to contribute in whatever way we could towards building an India of our dreams—a nation where our people would not only hold their heads high in freedom but would be free from hunger and poverty. A nation where our people could live with equal respect and love for one another. A nation that would eventually be counted among the foremost nations of the world. It was then that I realised, in humility, that choosing to lead one kind of life means putting aside the desire to pursue other options. This transformation took place within me fifty years ago, when I agreed to work for a small cooperative of dairy farmers who were trying to gain control over their lives. To be quite honest, service to our nation’s farmers was not the career I had envisioned for myself. But somehow, a series of events swept me along and put me in a certain time with a choice that would transform my life. I could have pursued a career in metallurgy and become the"}

Or, opted for a commission in the Indian Army and maybe retired as a general. Or, I could have left for the US and gone on to become a highly successful NRI. Yet, I chose none of these because somewhere, deep down, I knew I could make a more meaningful contribution by working here in Anand, Gujarat. Your grandmother too made an important choice. She knew, in those days, life in Anand could not offer even the simple comforts that we take for granted today. However, she ardently supported my choice to live and work in Anand. That choice of your grandmother to stand by me has given me an everlasting strength, always ensuring that I shouldered my responsibilities with poise. Whenever I have received any recognition for my contributions towards the progress of our country, I always emphasised that it is a recognition of the achievements of many people with whom I had a privilege to be associated with. I would like to stress even more strongly that my contributions have been possible only because I have consistently adhered to certain values. Values that I have inherited from my parents and other family elders; values that I saw in my mentor and supporter here in Anand—Tribhuvandas Patel. I have often spoken of integrity as the most important of these values, realising that integrity—and personal integrity, at that—is being honest to yourself. If you are always honest to yourself, it does not take much effort in always being honest with others. I have also learnt what I am sure you, too, will find out some day. Life is a privilege and to waste it would be wrong. In living this privilege called ‘life’, you must accept responsibility for yourself, always use your talents to the best of your ability and contribute somehow to the common good. That common good will present itself to you in many forms every day. If you look around you, you will find there is a lot waiting to be done: your friend may need some help, your teacher could be looking for a volunteer, or the community you live in will need you to make a contribution. I hope that you, too, will discover, as I did, that failure is not about not succeeding. Rather, it is about not putting in your best effort and not contributing, however modestly, to the common good. In life you, too, will discover as I did, that anything can go wrong at any time and mostly does. Yet, there is little correlation between the circumstances of people’s lives and how happy they are. Most of us compare ourselves with someone we think is happier—a relative, an acquaintance, or often, someone we barely know. But when we start looking closely we realise that what we saw were only images of perfection. And that will help us understand and cherish what we have, rather than what we don’t have."}

The em dash (—) is used to add extra information or to show a change in thought within a sentence.

Financial literacy is an essential lifelong skill that should be taught to children from an early age. Preparing children with financial literacy skills is an investment for their future well-being. By imparting an understanding of money, saving, budgeting, and wise spending, we empower them to navigate the financial world with confidence as they grow up. Whether it is managing a cooperative society, a start-up, or a household budget, financial literacy is an ongoing learning process that evolves as children grow and their understanding deepens. An introduction to concepts of saving, budgeting, investing, and responsible spending equips them with essential life skills. Children learn best through practical examples. Real-life situations help them understand the value of money and the importance of making wise financial choices. Thinking critically before spending helps cultivate responsible habits. The concept of saving and investing can be explained through relatable examples, such as planting seeds that grow into trees bearing fruit. As children grow older, they will learn to differentiate between needs and wants, compare prices before making a purchase and understand importance of financial literacy. Discuss in groups. 1. The importance of learning about money and saving from a young age. Share one example of it. 2. Imagine you received some money as a gift. How would you decide whether to save it, spend it, or invest it? What factors would you consider? 3. If you were in charge of planning a small event at school with a limited budget, how would you manage the money? 4. Why is financial literacy important for everyone?"}

As you listen, complete the sentences by filling in the blanks with one or two exact words or phrases you hear. Hello, everyone! Let me tell you about the Param Vir Chakra. It is one of the most prestigious awards in India and signifies the ‘Wheel of the Ultimate Brave.’ This award is granted for ‘exemplary bravery in the presence of the enemy.’ This means that this award is given to someone who shows extraordinary courage and bravery while fighting the enemy. The medal was instituted as a Gallantry Medal with retrospective effect from 15 August 1947 by Dr. Rajendra Prasad, the then President of India. The medal was designed by Mrs. Savitri Khanolkar, who drew inspiration from Sage Dadhichi, a Vedic rishi, who made the ultimate sacrifice by giving up his body so that the gods could create a deadly weapon called Vajra, or Thunderbolt, from his spine. The Param Vir Chakra is cast in bronze. At its centre, on a raised circle, is the State Emblem of India. Surrounding it are four replicas of Indra’s Vajra, lined with lotus flowers. That, my dear friends, is the Param Vir Chakra, a true symbol of bravery. Thank you. TRANSCRIPTS"}

As you listen, arrange the pictures in the correct sequence of events that took place. Now, for the special broadcast, we bring you the story of a young hero whose courage has captured the nation’s heart. On a fateful morning in Rajouri, young Rohan Ramchandra Bahir, a 15-year-old student, became a local hero when he fearlessly saved the life of a woman who had fallen into the Domri River while washing clothes. The 43-year-old woman was struggling to stay afloat in the strong currents, when Rohan, without a moment’s hesitation, leapt into the river, putting his own life at risk. With great determination and courage, Rohan managed to reach the woman and pull her to safety, despite the dangerous conditions of the river. Onlookers who witnessed the incident were in awe of the young boy’s bravery. Rohan’s selfless act did not go unnoticed. His incredible courage was recognised at Vigyan Bhawan, where he was honoured with the prestigious Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar 2023 by the President of India, Droupadi Murmu. This remarkable young boy is now a symbol of heroism in his community, and his story is an inspiration to all. We commend Rohan for his bravery and for showing that age is no barrier when it comes to saving lives.

Evelyn Glennie’s loss of hearing had been gradual. By the time she was 11 her performance in school had deteriorated and her headmistress urged her parents to take her to a specialist. It was then discovered that her hearing was severely impaired as a result of gradual nerve damage. “Everything suddenly looked black,” says Evelyn. But Evelyn was not going to give up. She was determined to lead a normal life and pursue her interest in music. One day she noticed a girl playing a xylophone and decided that she wanted to play it too. Most of the teachers discouraged her but percussionist Ron Forbes spotted her potential. He began by tuning two large drums to different notes. “Don’t listen through your ears,” he would say, “try to sense it some other way.” Says Evelyn, “Suddenly I realised I could feel the higher drum from the waist up and the lower one from the waist down.” Forbes repeated the exercise, and soon Evelyn discovered that she could sense certain notes in different parts of her body. “I had learnt to open my mind and body to sounds and vibrations.” She explains, “It pours in through every part of my body. It tingles in the skin, my cheekbones and even in my hair.” The rest was sheer determination and hard work. She never looked back from that point onwards. And she got right to the top, the world’s most sought-after multi percussionist with a mastery of some thousand instruments."}

Encyclopedia and his mother knew what that meant. He had a mystery he could not solve. “Tim Nolan died yesterday,” he announced in a matter-of-fact manner. “That name is familiar,” Mrs. Brown said. “Wasn’t he mixed up in a jewellery robbery a few years ago?” “Five years ago,” Chief Brown replied. “Two masked men held up the Diamond Mart on Sixth Avenue. They got away with a million dollars worth of jewellery.” “I thought Tim Nolan was arrested,” Mrs. Brown said. “He was questioned, not arrested,” Chief Brown corrected. “I always believed that Nolan and a friend, a man named Daniel Davenport, pulled the hold-ups. There wasn’t any proof, though.” Encyclopedia sat quietly. He knew his mother and father were discussing the case for his benefit. His father filled in the facts. “Nolan and Davenport had met,” Chief Brown said, “while both were in prison in South Carolina. They became friendly because of shared interests.

He took out his pocket notebook and leafed through the pages. “I copied what Nolan wrote on the sheet,” he said. “Here it is.” He handed the notebook to Mrs. Brown. She read what he had copied. “It has Davenport’s name and address,” she said, “and a few words I don’t understand.” She handed the notebook to Encyclopedia. “What do you make of the four words, Leroy?” Encyclopedia read the four words below Davenport’s name and address: Nom Utes Sweden Hurts. Mrs. Brown looked at him hopefully. Usually he needed to ask only one question to solve a case before dessert. They were still on the soup. Encyclopedia leaned back and closed his eyes when he did his hardest thinking.

Davenport will understand it easily. Still, it wouldn’t make much sense to someone who isn’t looking for a hiding place.” “Leroy!” Mrs. Brown exclaimed. “What do the four words mean?” “You already guessed, Mom.

Then he used the other letters to form words. So, Nom = Monday, Utes = Tuesday, Sweden = Wednesday and Hurts = Thursday. The unwritten fifth word was Fir, or Friday.

This ancient landform, consisting of a giant hole, came into existence when a colossal meteorite, blazing at an extremely high speed, crashed into the Earth, leaving behind a stunning mark. It is the only crater in India formed in basaltic rock by a meteorite impact and ranks as the third largest in the world, placing it among the top five largest craters globally.

It also instructs visitors to park vehicles in the box marked with a white point on the road, which is known as the Magnetic Road. When the vehicles are parked at the indicated spot, they begin moving forward at a speed of almost 20km/h. This unusual place creates an optical illusion where vehicles appear to roll uphill, a sight that has left tourists in disbelief for years, caused by the peculiar alignment of surrounding slopes and the horizon line. 5.

The Sundarbans is one such mangrove forest spread over 1,400 kms in West Bengal, lying in the delta of rivers, such as the Ganga, the Brahmaputra, and the Meghna.

In the given sentences, the highlighted words ‘living’, ‘striking’, and ‘rugged’ are examples of verbs used as adjectives. Such verbs are called participles. Participles are verb forms that can function as adjectives, and they come in two types: present participles (‘living’ and ‘striking’) usually ending in –ing, and past participles (‘rugged’) usually ending in -ed, -d, -t, -en, or –n. (though irregular verbs may vary) Present participles are used to describe ongoing or continuous actions. For example, People have seen these lights moving quickly in random directions but often hanging out in one spot for a while before fading. Past participles usually describe actions that have already been completed. For example, When the vehicles are parked at the indicated spot, they begin moving forward at a speed of almost 20km/h.

As you listen, mark true or false for the statements 1–4. Hello everyone! In today’s episode, we’ll be discussing some simple but effective ways to improve our observation skills. Being observant isn’t just about seeing, it’s about truly noticing details in the world around us. Whether it’s in daily life or in the workplace, observation skills can help us become more aware, make better decisions, and even improve memory. Let’s get started! First, slow down and take your time. Rushing through tasks often leads to missed details. When you take time to focus on what’s in front of you, you’re more likely to notice features you might otherwise overlook. When you pause and observe, the details become clearer. Anothereffectivemethodistoengageallyoursenses.Observation isn’t just about seeing; it’s also about hearing, smelling, touching, and even tasting. The more senses you engage, the more information you absorb. For example, when you’re in a new environment, don’t just look around—pay attention to sounds, smells, and textures too. A third tip is to ask questions. Curious people tend to be better observers because they actively try to understand what they’re noticing. Asking questions about what you see, like “Why is this here?” or “What purpose does it serve?” forces your brain to think critically about what you’re observing. Next, take notes or make sketches. Writing down what you observe can help reinforce details in your memory. Even quick sketches of an object or place can strengthen your understanding of its features. TRANSCRIPTS"}

They were a little sweet, a little sour; small, bright red cherries, which had come all the way from the Kashmir Valley. Here in the Himalayan foothills where Rakesh lived, there were not many fruit trees. The soil was stony, and the dry cold winds stunted the growth of most plants. But on the more sheltered slopes there were forests of oak and deodar. Rakesh lived with his grandfather on the outskirts of Mussoorie, just where the forest began. His father and mother lived in a small village fifty miles away, where they grew maize and rice and barley in narrow terraced fields on the lower slopes of the mountain. But there were no schools in the village, and Rakesh’s parents were keen that he should go to school. As soon as he was of school-going age, they sent him to stay with his grandfather in Mussoorie. He had a little cottage outside the town. Rakesh was on his way home from school when he bought the cherries. He paid fifty paise for the bunch. It took him about half-an-hour to walk home, and by the time he reached the cottage there were only three cherries left. ‘Have a cherry, Grandfather,’ he said, as soon as he saw his grandfather in the garden. Grandfather took one cherry and Rakesh promptly ate the other two. He kept the last seed in his mouth for some time, stunted: stopped (from growing to the usual size) outskirts: the areas that form the edge of a town or city"}

If you want luck, you must put it to some use.’ ‘What can I do with a seed?’ ‘Plant it.’ So Rakesh found a small space and began to dig up a flowerbed. ‘Hey, not there,’ said Grandfather. ‘I’ve sown mustard in that bed. Plant it in that shady corner, where it won’t be disturbed.’ Rakesh went to a corner of the garden where the earth was soft and yielding. He did not have to dig. He pressed the seed into the soil with his thumb and it went right in. Then he had his lunch, and ran off to play cricket with his friends, and forgot all about the cherry seed. When it was winter in the hills, a cold wind blew down from the snows and went whoo-whoo-whoo in the deodar trees, and the garden was dry and bare.

Rakesh found the newspaper very dull— especially after the stories—but Grandfather wanted all the news... They knew it was spring when the wild duck flew north again, to Siberia. Early in the morning, when he got up to chop wood and light a fire, Rakesh saw the V-shaped formation streaming northward, the calls of the birds carrying clearly through the thin mountain air. One morning in the garden he bent to pick up what he thought was a small twig and found to his surprise that it was well rooted. He stared at it for a moment, then ran to fetch Grandfather, calling, ‘Dada, come and look, the cherry tree has come up!’ ‘What cherry tree?’ asked Grandfather, who had forgotten about it. ‘The seed we planted last year—look, it’s come up!’ Rakesh went down on his haunches, while Grandfather bent almost double and peered down at the tiny tree. It was about four inches high. ‘Yes, it’s a cherry tree,’ said Grandfather. ‘You should water it now and then.’ Rakesh ran indoors and came back with a bucket of water. ‘Don’t drown it!’ said Grandfather.

That year the monsoon rains came early and Rakesh plodded to and from school in raincoat and chappals. Ferns sprang from the trunks of trees, strange-looking lilies came up in the long grass, and even when it wasn’t raining the trees dripped and mist came curling up the valley. The cherry tree grew quickly in this season. It was about two feet high when a goat entered the garden and ate all the leaves.

She did not try to avoid the tree: one sweep, and the cherry tree was cut in two. When Grandfather saw what had happened, he went after the woman and scolded her; but the damage could not be repaired. ‘Maybe it will die now,’ said Rakesh. ‘Maybe,’ said Grandfather. But the cherry tree had no intention of dying. By the time summer came round again, it had sent out several new shoots with tender green leaves. Rakesh had grown taller too.

Even when there was rain, Rakesh would sometimes water the tree. He wanted it to know that he was there. One day he found a bright green praying-mantis perched on a branch, peering at him with bulging eyes. Rakesh let it remain there; it was the cherry tree’s first visitor. The next visitor was a hairy caterpillar, who started making a meal of the leaves. Rakesh removed it quickly and dropped it on a heap of dry leaves. ‘Come back when you’re a butterfly,’ he said. Winter came early. The cherry tree bent low with the weight of snow. Field-mice sought shelter in the roof of the cottage. The road from the valley was blocked, and for several days there was no newspaper, and this made Grandfather quite grumpy. His stories began to have unhappy endings. In February it was Rakesh’s birthday. He was nine—and the tree was four, but almost as tall as Rakesh. One morning, when the sun came out, Grandfather came into the garden to let some warmth ‘get into my bones,’ as he put it. He stopped in front of the cherry tree, stared at it for a few moments, and then called out, ‘Rakesh! Come and look! Come quickly before it falls!’ Rakesh and Grandfather gazed at the tree as though it had performed a miracle. There was a pale pink blossom at the end of a branch. The following year there were more blossoms. And suddenly the tree was taller than Rakesh, even though it was less than half his age.

In the cherry tree, bees came to feed on the nectar in the blossoms, and tiny birds pecked at the blossoms and broke them off. But the tree kept blossoming right through the spring, and there were always more blossoms than birds. That summer there were small cherries on the tree. Rakesh tasted one and spat it out. ‘It’s too sour,’ he said. ‘They’ll be better next year,’ said Grandfather. But the birds liked them—especially the bigger birds, such as the bulbuls and scarlet minivets—and they flitted in and out of the foliage, feasting on the cherries. On a warm sunny afternoon, when even the bees looked sleepy, Rakesh was looking for Grandfather without finding him in any of his favourite places around the house. Then he looked out of the bedroom window and saw Grandfather reclining on a cane chair under the cherry tree. ‘There’s just the right amount of shade here,’ said Grandfather. ‘And I like looking at the leaves.’ ‘They’re pretty leaves,’ said Rakesh. ‘And they are always ready to dance, if there’s a breeze.’ After Grandfather had come indoors, Rakesh went into the garden and lay down on the grass beneath the tree.

As you listen, number the events in the correct order in which they happen. Hello everyone! Did you know that rice is actually a type of grass, and the part we eat is its seed? Let me tell you about the process of cultivating rice. It all starts with preparing the land. First, the soil has to be ploughed. Rice is typically grown in fertile soil that holds a lot of water. The most important step in preparing the soil is to soak it with plenty of water. This step is called puddling. Once the nursery bed is prepared, the seeds can be planted. After that, we sow the seeds on the soil’s surface. Paddy farmers have to ensure that their fields stay flooded with water because irrigation is crucial. It takes around 4 to 5 weeks for the seeds to grow into seedlings. After this comes the most important step—transplanting. The seedlings that were prepared in the nursery bed are uprooted and then transplanted into the flooded field. In around 120 days, the rice plants are fully grown. At this point, the crops are harvested by cutting them. Following this, the seeds are separated from the plant. This is called threshing. To reduce the moisture content even more, the separated grains are dried. This ensures that they can be stored or processed further. Through a process called milling, the rice is separated from the outer covering on it. Finally, the rice reaches the market, and that’s where we get it to make all kinds of delicious foods. Whether it’s Appam, Pulao, Khichdi, or Daal Bhaat, rice is a big part of many meals. II Now listen to the talk again. As you listen, choose the correct option to answer the questions that follow."}

Actually he was a wiry little fellow, like most of the early spacers, and managed to qualify easily for the 150-pound bonus that kept so many of us on a reducing diet. Had he been built otherwise, his chances of getting a job in space would have been very slim. Sven was one of our best construction men, and excelled at the tricky and specialised work of collecting assorted girders as they floated around in free fall, making them do the slow-motion, three-dimensional ballet that would get them into their right positions, and fusing the pieces together when they were precisely dovetailed into the intended pattern: it was a skilled and difficult job, for a space suit is not the most convenient of garbs in which to work. However, Sven’s team had one great advantage over the construction groups you see putting up skyscrapers down on Earth. They could step back and admire their handiwork without being abruptly parted from it by gravity. Don’t ask me why Sven wanted a pet, or why he chose the one he did.

Claribel weighed practically nothing, her food requirements were tiny—and she was not worried, as most animals would have been, by the absence of gravity. I first became aware that Claribel was aboard when I was sitting in the little cubbyhole laughingly called my office, checking through my lists of technical stores to decide what items we’d be running out of next. When I heard the musical whistle beside my ear, I assumed that it had come over the station intercom, and waited for an announcement to follow. It didn’t; instead, there was a long and involved pattern of melody that made me look up with such a start that I forgot all about the angle beam just behind my head. When the stars had ceased to explode before my eyes, I had my first view of Claribel. She was a small yellow canary, hanging in the air as motionless as a hummingbird—and with much less effort, for her wings were quietly folded along her sides. We stared at each other for a minute; then, before I had quite recovered my wits, she did a curious kind of backward loop I’m sure no earthbound canary had ever managed, and departed with a few leisurely flicks. It was quite obvious that she’d already learned how to operate in the absence of gravity, and did not believe in doing unnecessary work. Sven didn’t confess to her ownership for several days, and by that time it no longer mattered, because Claribel was a general pet. He had smuggled her up on the last ferry from Earth, when he came back from leave—partly, he claimed, out of sheer scientific curiosity. He wanted to see just how a bird would operate when it had no weight but could still use its wings. Claribel thrived and grew fat. On the whole, we had little trouble concealing our guest when VIPs from Earth came visiting. A space station has more hiding places than you can count; the only problem was that Claribel got rather noisy when she was upset, and we sometimes had to think fast to explain the curious peeps and whistles that came from ventilating shafts and storage bulkheads. There were a couple of narrow escapes—but then who would dream of looking for a canary in a space station? aboard: on an aircraft cubbyhole: a small enclosed space or room ceased: stopped canary: a popular bird which people love to keep as pets; found in open areas with small trees and shrubs wits: ability to think quickly flicks: sudden, quick movements concealing: hiding ventilating shafts: passageways or ducts that allow fresh air in a closed space bulkheads: dividing walls or barriers between separate compartments in an aircraft"}

I’ve never listened to a canary’s heart,” he added rather apologetically. “Give her a shot of oxygen,” suggested somebody, pointing to the green-banded emergency cylinder in its recess beside the door. Everyone agreed that this was an excellent idea, and Claribel was tucked snugly into a face mask that was large enough to serve as a complete oxygen tent for her. To our delighted surprise, she revived at once. Beaming broadly, Sven removed the mask, and she hopped onto his finger. She gave her series of “Come to the cookhouse, boys” trills—then promptly keeled over again. “I don’t get it,” lamented Sven. “What’s wrong with her? She’s never done this before.” For the last few minutes, something had been tugging at my memory. My mind seemed to be very sluggish that morning, as if I was still unable to cast off the burden of sleep. I felt that I could do with some of that oxygen—but before I could reach the mask, understanding exploded in my brain. I whirled on the duty engineer and said urgently: “Jim!” There’s something wrong with the air! That’s why Claribel’s passed out.

You may find out more information about it from the internet. 1. Write: Astronauts use a special Space Pen which has a cartridge with ink combined with resin. The ink remains solid until friction with the ball at the point of the pen liquefies it. It works in all positions, in extreme heat and cold, and in atmospheres ranging from pure oxygen to vacuum. 2. Exercise: Astronauts use resistance exercise equipment. Weight training is done by applying a load using vacuum cylinders. Running on the treadmill is made possible with the bodies held down using rubber straps. 3. Eat: Astronauts eat preserved foods which is dried, canned, vacuum-packed, and frozen. These can be prepared by adding cold or hot water, and some can be heated in an oven. They also eat ready-to-eat items, such as nuts, breads, and fruits. 4. Sleep: Astronauts can sleep on a floor, wall, or ceiling as there’s no distinction between up and down but they may gradually float away while sleeping. Therefore, they need to restrain their bodies in small sleeping compartments or sleeping bags. III Did you know that animals can save humans from natural calamities? Animals can sense natural calamities. Read the following examples and decide if this is true. • In 2004, before a tsunami could hit the coastline of Indonesia, some animals made efforts to flee—elephants ran for higher ground, flamingos abandoned low-lying nesting areas, and dogs refused to go outdoors. • Minutes before the Naples quake of 1805, oxen, sheep, dogs, and geese started making alarm calls in unison. • Migratory birds crossing the Pacific are able to dodge storms and other hazards. • In the Gulf of Mexico, sharks sense the drop in barometric pressure that precedes hurricanes and tend to swim to deeper waters as a result. Dolphins have also been observed swimming away from storm-prone areas. Scientists have studied this behaviour and found that when severe stresses arise in deep rock before the earthquake, ultra-low frequency electromagnetic waves are generated that animals can sense.

Today, the women behind ISRO’s Mars Orbiter Mission and Chandrayaan-3 are celebrated for their brilliance and achievements. However, the foundation was laid by early pioneers like Bibha Chowdhuri—India’s first woman physicist—who carved a path in the male-dominated field of physics. At a time when Indian women struggled to seek knowledge and equitable access to education, Bibha Chowdhuri emerged as a rare beam of light—a woman who defied the odds and lit a path for others to follow. Born in 1913 in Kolkata, in an India that still followed the traditional path. Bibha’s story was anything but ordinary. She was a scientist who rose not only against the societal expectations of women but also amidst the towering giants of science—men whose names the world would come to celebrate, while hers was whispered only in the halls of those who recognised her brilliance. Bibha’s persistence eventually earned her a place at the Bose Institute. She had already begun to chip away at the walls of exclusion, becoming the first Indian woman to excel in high-energy particle physics. Breaking Boundaries In 1945, Bibha’s academic journey took her to the University of Manchester. Under the guidance of the celebrated Nobel Laureate, Patrick M.S. Blackett, she delved deeper into the field of cosmic rays. Her Ph.D. thesis on cosmic rays earned local recognition, with newspapers introducing her as ‘India’s k"}
{"id": "class 8__eng__p251__c1", "text": "Science and Curiosity 235 New Woman Scientist—She has an eye for Cosmic Rays’. This title reflected the awe she inspired in a world still sceptical of her capabilities. In an era marked by towering scientific discoveries, Bibha was often on the cusp of greatness but remained in the shadows of her male counterparts. Her most notable contribution was the discovery of pi-mesons, a subatomic particle. Her nomination for a Nobel Prize in 1950 by Erwin Schrödinger, though unsuccessful, reflected her remarkable talent. Her life, full of challenges and struggles, was marked by an uphill battle to be heard and seen in the field of science. Chowdhuri never received any awards during her lifetime, but continued her work tirelessly. In 1949, upon her return to India, she became the first woman faculty member at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), personally selected by Homi J. Bhabha. Chowdhuri’s contributions spanned across research institutes like the Physical Research Laboratory in Ahmedabad and the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics in Kolkata. This is where she continued her work on cosmic rays and subatomic particles. Through decades of crucial research, from Kolar Gold Mines to the Physical Research Laboratory under the mentorship of Vikram Sarabhai, Bibha’s work went on quietly, as she remained in the periphery of Indian scientific acclaim. She passed away in 1991, her story untold, her name largely forgotten. The Legacy of Bibha Chowdhuri and Today’s Women in Indian Science The stars are not meant to remain hidden forever. In 2019, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) honoured her legacy by renaming a star in the constellation Leo—HD 86081—as ‘Bibha,’ meaning ‘beam of light.’ Fittingly, she is now a ‘star in heaven,’ a symbol of the light she brought to Indian science.

In 2020, the Government of India declared a chair professorship in her name. Fast forward to the present day, and the advancements made by women in Indian science reflect Chowdhuri’s pioneering spirit and the progress she helped ignite. Women in ISRO, for instance, are no longer participants but leaders in missions that make global headlines. One such luminary is Dr. Ritu Karidhal Srivastava, popularly referred to as the ‘Rocket Woman of India.’ Her pivotal role in ISRO’s Mars Orbiter Mission and subsequent leadership in Chandrayaan-2 and Chandrayaan-3 reflect the leaps women have made in STEM in India. Over 50 women contributed to Chandrayaan-3, and their success is built upon the shoulders of pioneers like Bibha Chowdhuri. Their roles in developing autonomous systems for spacecraft and managing mission-critical operations highlight the capabilities of women in pushing India’s space programme forward. From Shadows to the Stars The journey from Bibha Chowdhuri’s era to today’s women scientists has been long and arduous, but it is also inspiring. The struggles Chowdhuri faced are a stark reminder of how far we’ve come—and how much further we have to go. But with every cosmic achievement—be it landing on the moon or reaching Mars—these women prove that the journey is well worth it. Bibha Chowdhuri’s legacy lives on. Her story continues to inspire young women to pursue their passions, break barriers, and leave their mark on the world.

{"id": "class 8__maths__p3__c1", "text": "FOREWORD The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 envisages a system of education in the country that is rooted in an Indian ethos and its civilisational accomplishments in all fields of knowledge and human endeavour. At the same time, it aims to prepare students to engage constructively with the opportunities and challenges of the twenty-first century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. By nurturing students’ inherent abilities across all five planes of human existence (pañchakośhas), the Foundational and Preparatory Stages set the Stage for further learning at the Middle Stage. Spanning Grades 6 to 8, the Middle Stage serves as a critical three-year bridge between the Preparatory and Secondary Stages. The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It aims to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages—including at least two languages native to India— to Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas, as these textbooks are intended to play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy’s role that helps strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups (CAGs), which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. Ganita Prakash, the textbook of mathematics for Grade 8 (Part 1) is designed to make learning fun, engaging, and meaningful. Aligned with NEP 2020 and NCF-SE 2023, the textbook continues to foster the spirit of experiential and inquiry-based learning, a spirit already introduced in the mathematics textbooks for Grades 6 and 7. It encourages students to ask questions, think critically, and understand concepts of mathematics through real-world contexts."}
{"id": "class 8__maths__p4__c1", "text": "iv The textbook makes efforts to encourage the students to observe and explore patterns around them and discover mathematical concepts on their own. The content is structured in a way that supports a joyful and progressive understanding of increasingly complex concepts, easing students into more advanced learning. The content attempts to integrate mathematics with other subject areas, such as Science, Social Science with cross-cutting themes like environmental education, value education, inclusive education, and Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS). At most of the places the concept begins with either a story or a puzzle that not only makes students think but also feels the importance of the concept. However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook, and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years. \b Dinesh Prasad Saklani \b Director New Delhi\b National Council of Educational June 2025\b Research and Training"}
{"id": "class 8__maths__p5__c1", "text": "ABOUT THE BOOK Mathematics helps students develop not only basic arithmetic skills, but also the crucial capacities of logical reasoning, creative problem-solving, and clear and precise communication (both oral and written). Mathematical knowledge also plays a crucial role in understanding concepts in other school subjects, such as Science and Social Science, and even Arts, Physical Education, and Vocational Education. Learning Mathematics contributes to the development of capacities to make informed choices and decisions. Understanding numbers and quantitative arguments is necessary for effective and meaningful democratic and economic participation. Mathematics thus plays an important role in achieving the overall aims of school education. Mathematics at the Middle Stage is a major challenge and performs the dual role of being both close to the experience and environment of a learner and being abstract. It performs the role of developing intuition, while also maintaining and emphasising rigour. It is enhancing critical and logical thinking, while also developing artistry and creativity, and a sense of elegance and aesthetics. Mathematics provides students with plenty of opportunities to explore and discover concepts on their own while also teaching the best-known methods in the global repertoire of mathematics. This textbook attempts to address the goals and challenges of learning mathematics. The writers have aimed to strike a judicious balance between informal and formal definitions and methods in helping students to develop both intuition and rigour. The textbook also provides numerous opportunities for student-student and student–teacher interaction in the classroom to promote active and experiential learning. A number of questions, puzzles, and interactive exercises are posed throughout the textbook to encourage constant exploration. Many of the questions are open-ended to stimulate classroom discussion. The Chapter 1: ‘A Square and A Cube’ is an introduction to the special types of numbers called squares and cubes through engaging explorations, and contexts. Chapter 2: ‘Power Play’ considers short and logical ways of expressing very large numbers, and discusses how they can be written and read without ambiguity. Chapter 3: ‘A Story of Numbers’ reveals how the idea of number and number representation evolved over the course of time, across different places in the world, to finally reach its modern efficient form. Chapter 4: ‘Quadrilaterals’ discusses some interesting types of four-sided figures and problems based on them. Chapter 5: ‘Number Play’ shows different properties of numbers studied by the students with a balance of engaging activities"}

Chapter 6: ‘We Distribute, Yet Things Multiply’ covers aspects related to Algebra, and in particular, the distributive law. Chapter 7: ‘Proportional Reasoning’ explores a new way to compare two quantities using daily life situations. In all the chapters, an attempt has been made to emphasise connections with other subjects including Art, History and Science. By weaving storytelling and hands-on activities together, as done in Grades 6 and 7, we hope that an immersive learning experience will be created that ignites curiosity and fosters a love for mathematics. It is hoped that teachers would give students the opportunity to discuss, play, engage with each other and provide logical arguments for different ideas, and find loopholes in arguments presented. This is necessary for the learners to eventually develop the ability to understand what it means to prove something and also become confident about the underlying concepts. The mathematics classroom should not expect a blind application of algorithms but should rather encourage students to find many different ways to solve problems. As per the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, computational thinking has also been gently introduced through puzzles, games, and interactive exercises that encourage students on these aspects. Indian rootedness has also been kept in mind while giving contexts for different concepts. The contributions of Indian mathematicians have also been given as part of a problem-solving approach to make students aware of India’s rich mathematical heritage and its global contributions to mathematics. The concepts and problems in this textbook are related to daily life situations. An attempt has been made to use contexts and materials that students are familiar with. Learning material sheets have been given at the back of the book that may be photocopied and used in the classroom. Exercises or activities are often given to encourage peer group efforts and discussions. However, this textbook intends to address the learning needs of a diverse group of students in the classroom. We have tried to link concepts learnt in initial chapters with ideas in subsequent chapters, to show the connectedness and unity of mathematics. We hope that teachers can revise these concepts in a spiralling way so that students are able to appreciate the entire conceptual structure of mathematics. We hope that teachers may focus more on the ideas of squares and cubes, exponents, evolution of numbers and other notions that are new to the students, and are foundational for further learning. Finally, this textbook aims to be more than just a textbook — it is a passport to a world of mathematical discovery and exploration.

This task calls for providing a fertile environment that allows for the flowering of mathematical thinking in the minds of students. Classrooms,where students just listen and write down whatever is being told to them or written on the board, are deficient in the conditions required for learning mathematics. Instead, classrooms need to be places where students are engaged in playing with mathematical concepts, finding and discussing patterns, and developing creative strategies together to solve problems. Students should also be posing problems to each other and discussing possible solutions with each other. In fact, these are the very conditions that have led to the development of the entire field of mathematics so far, and so one cannot expect students to pick up mathematical thinking and understanding without these conditions. Fortunately, it is not difficult to create such conditions in the classroom. It just requires an interesting question, problem, pattern, or challenge to be thrown open to the students on a regular basis, and sufficient time to be given to them to play with, discuss, and work on it as a class or in pairs or groups. Along with it, an environment that accepts mistakes and acknowledges their importance in learning needs to be nurtured. While creating the spark for initiating mathematical thinking in classrooms is not difficult, sustaining it may be challenging and may involve efforts from your side. Nevertheless, even if just the first part of throwing open a question, problem, pattern, or challenge is done at least once or twice a week, accompanied by sufficient waiting time from your side for students to play, discuss, and work on it, it can have a great positive impact on how the students view and approach mathematics. It should be noted that this positive impact will not happen overnight. That takes time and depends on various factors such as the number of opportunities you give for problem solving, your patience, and the encouragement you give to the students. To support you in posing problems, all the problems or questions in this book are marked using the icons and . These icons are indicators of potential opportunities to start off a process of problem-solving and exploration in the classroom. You will find some of the problems labelled ‘ Math Talk ’. Such questions can especially be made as topics for classroom discussion."}

These can be brought out during classroom discussions, both where the owl is present and also in other similar situations. In this grade, justification/proofs of mathematical statements find an increased presence. Students should be gently encouraged to deduce properties and not be forced to do it. Whenever students face challenges in doing it, encourage them to experiment and observe, and use their intuition in figuring out properties. Providing justification/ proof is a skill that takes time to develop. To develop students’ mathematical thinking and understanding of concepts, a sufficient number of problems are given. Trying to ‘cover’ all of them must not happen at the cost of students not getting to spend quality time on playing with and discussing them. It is important to understand that the exploratory problems are not only for promoting problem solving skills; they also serve in strengthening procedural fluency when children start engaging in exploration. Efforts must be made in making students independent learners. One essential aspect required for this is an ability to read and understand mathematical text. To promote this skill, students should be encouraged to read the book by themselves and in groups. Give opportunities to them to interpret what they read and express it to others. This will also address the big problem that students face in speaking mathematics and interpreting word problems. This textbook contains a number of open-ended problems. It also contains new treatments of certain concepts. If you are not able to solve them or follow some of them immediately, it is perfectly okay! Not everyone knows everything. Along with trying to understand and reflect upon such content,it will be very useful to take it to the classroom and open it up for discussion.

Her son Khoisnam and their 99 relatives were invited to the reading of her will. She wanted to leave all of her ratnas to her son, but she knew that if she did so, all their relatives would pester Khoisnam forever. She hoped that she had taught him everything he needed to know about solving puzzles. She left the following note in her will— “I have created a puzzle. If all 100 of you answer it at the same time, you will share the ratnas equally. However, if you are the first one to solve the problem, you will get to keep the entire inheritance to yourself. Good luck.” The minister took Khoisnam and his 99 relatives to a secret room in the mansion containing 100 lockers. The minister explained— “Each person is assigned a number from 1 to 100. • Person 1 opens every locker. • \u0007Person 2 toggles every 2nd locker (i.e., closes it if it is open, opens it if it is closed). • Person 3 toggles every 3rd locker (3rd, 6th, 9th, … and so on). • Person 4 toggles every 4th locker (4th, 8th, 12th, … and so on). This continues until all 100 get their turn. In the end, only some lockers remain open. The open lockers reveal the code to the fortune in the safe.” Before the process begins, Khoisnam realises that he already knows which lockers will be open at the end. How did he figure out the answer? Hint: Find out how many times each locker is toggled. A SQUARE AND A CUBE 1"}
{"id": "class 8__maths__p18__c1", "text": "Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 2 If a locker is toggled an odd number of times, it will be open. Otherwise, it will be closed. The number of times a locker is toggled is the same as the number of factors of the locker number. For example, for locker #6, Person 1 opens it, Person 2 closes it, Person 3 opens it and Person 6 closes it. The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 6 are factors of 6. If the number of factors is even, the locker will be toggled by an even number of people and it will eventually be closed. Note that each factor of a number has a ‛partner factor’ so that the product of the pair of factors yields the given number. Here, 1 and 6 form a pair of partner factors of 6, and 2 and 3 form another pair. Does every number have an even number of factors? We see in some cases, like 2 × 2, that the numbers in the pair are the same. Can you use this insight to find more numbers with an odd number of factors? For instance, 36 has a factor pair 6 × 6 where both numbers are 6. Does this number have an odd number of factors? If every factor of 36 other than 6 has a different factor as its partner, then we can be sure that 36 has an odd number of factors. Check if this is true. Hence all the following numbers have an odd number of factors — 1 × 1, 2 × 2, 3 × 3, 4 × 4, ... A number that can be expressed as the product of a number with itself is called a square number, or simply a square. The only numbers that have an odd number of factors are the squares, because they each have one factor which, when multiplied by itself, equals the number. Therefore, every locker whose number is a square will remain open. 6: 1 × 6 2 × 3 Factors are 1, 2, 3 and 6. 1: 1 × 1 The only factor is 1. 4: 1 × 4 2 × 2 Factors are 1, 2 and 4. 9: 1 × 9 3 × 3 Factors are 1, 3 and 9."}

We know that the number of unit squares in a square (the area of a square) is the product of its sides. The table below gives the areas of squares with different sides. We use the following notation for squares. 1 × 1 = 12 = 1 2 × 2 = 22 = 4 3 × 3 = 32 = 9, 4 × 4 = 42 = 16 5 × 5 = 52 = 25. ... In general, for any number n, we write n × n = n2, which is read as ‛n squared’. Can we have a square of sidelength 3 5 or 2.5 units? Yes, there area in square units are ( 3 5) 2 = ( 3 5) × ( 3 5) = ( 9 25), and (2.5) 2 = (2.5) × (2.5) = 6.25. Khoisnam immediately collects word clues from these 10 lockers and reads, “The passcode consists of the first five locker numbers that were touched exactly twice.” Which are these five lockers? The lockers that are toggled twice are the prime numbers, since each prime number has 1 and the number itself as factors. So, the code is 2-3-5-7-11. Sidelength (in units) Area (in sq units) 1 1 × 1 = 1 sq. unit 2 2 × 2 = 4 sq. units 3 3 × 3 = 9 sq. units 4 4 × 4 = 16 sq. units 5 5 × 5 = 25 sq. units 10 10 × 10 = 100 sq. units"}

The picture below explains why each subsequent inverted L gives the next odd number: We see that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n2. Alternatively, every square is a sum of successive odd numbers starting from 1. Also, we can find out whether a number is a perfect square by successively subtracting odd numbers. Consider the number 25, successively subtract 1, 3, 5, ... until you get or cross over 0, This means 25 = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 and is thus a perfect square. Since we subtracted the first five odd numbers, 25 = 52. Using the pattern above, find 362, given that 352 = 1225. From the question we know that 1225 is the sum of the first 35 odd numbers. To find 362, we need to add the 36th odd number to 1225. How do we find the 36th odd number? The 1st odd number is 1, 2nd odd number is 3, 3rd number is 5, …, 6th odd number is 11 and so on. What is the nth odd number? The nth odd number is 2n–1. Therefore, the 36th odd number is 71. By adding 71 to 1225, we get 1296, which is 362.

In general, if y= x2 then x is the square root of y. What is the square root of 64? We know that 8 × 8 is 64. So, 8 is the square root of 64. What about – 8 × – 8 ? That is 64 too! 82 = 64, and (– 8)2 = 64. So, the square roots of 64 are + 8 and – 8. Every perfect square has two integer square roots. One is positive and the other is negative. The square root of a number is denoted by Thus, 64 8 =± and 100 10 =± . Note that 8 8 2 =± and 10 10 2 =± . In general, n n 2 =± . In this chapter, we shall only consider the positive square root. Given a number, such as 576 or 327, how do we find out if it is a perfect square? If it is a perfect square, how can we find its square root? We know that perfect squares end in 1, 4, 9, 6, 5, or an even number of zeros. But, it is not certain that a number that satisfies this condition is a square. We can clearly say that 327 is not a perfect square. However, we cannot be sure that 576 is a perfect square. 1. We can list all the square numbers in sequence and find out whether 576 occurs among them. We know that 202 = 400, we can find squares of 21, 22, 23, … and so on until we get 576 or a number greater than 576. 202 = 400 212 = 441 222 = 484 232 = 529 242 = 576 \u0007However, this process becomes inefficient for larger numbers. 2. Recall that every square can be expressed as a sum of consecutive odd numbers starting from 1. Consider 81. \u0007 From 81, we successively subtracted consecutive odd numbers starting from 1 until we obtained 0 at the 9th step. Therefore 81 = 9. \u0007 Can we find the square root of 729 using this method? Yes, but it will be time-consuming. Math Talk 81 – 1 = 80 80 – 3 = 77 77 – 5 = 72 72 – 7 = 65 65 – 9 = 56 56 – 11 = 45 45 – 13 = 32 32 – 15 = 17 17 – 17 = 0"}
{"id": "class 8__maths__p25__c1", "text": "A Square and A Cube 9 3. We know that a perfect square is obtained by multiplying an integer by itself. Will looking at a number’s prime factorisation help in determining whether it is a perfect square? \u0007 Yes, if we can divide the prime factors of a number into two equal groups, then the product of the prime factors in either group combine to form the square root. Is 324 a perfect square? 324 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3. These can be grouped as 324 = (2 × 3 × 3) × (2 × 3 × 3). = (2 × 3 × 3)2 = 182. We can also write the prime factors in pairs. That is, 324 = (2 × 2) × (3 × 3) × (3 × 3), which shows that 324 is a perfect square. Thus, 324 = (2×3×3)2 = 182. Therefore, 324 =18. Is 156 a perfect square? The prime factorisation of 156 is 2 × 2 × 3 × 13. We cannot pair up these factors. Therefore, 156 is not a perfect square. Find whether 1156 and 2800 are perfect squares using prime factorisation. We can estimate the square root of larger perfect squares by looking at the closest perfect squares we are familiar with and then narrowing down the interval to search. For example, to find 1936 , we can reason as follows: (i) 1936 is between 1600 (402) and 2500 (502), so 40 < 1936 < 50. (ii) The last digit of 1936 is 6. So, the last digit of the square root must either be 4 or 6. It can be 44 or 46. (iii) If we calculate 452, we can compare it with 1936 to halve the interval to search from 40–50 to either 40–45 or 45–50. We can write 452 as (40 + 5) (40 + 5) = 402 + 2 × 40 × 5 + 52 = 1600 + 400 + 25 = 2025. (iv) 2025 > 1936. So, 40 < 1936 < 45 (v) From the observation in point b we can guess and then verify that 1936 is 44. Consider the following situations — Aribam and Bijou play a game.

Bijou is not able to answer because 250 is not a perfect square. Aribam asks Bijou if he can at least provide a number that is close to the square root of 250. For this, Bijou needs to estimate the square root of 250. We know that 100 < 250 < 400 and 100 = 10 and 400 = 20. So, 10 < 250 < 20. But, we are still not very close to the number whose square is 250. We know that 152 = 225 and 162 = 256. Therefore, 15 < 250 < 16. Since 256 is much closer to 250 than 225, 250 is approximately 16. We also know it is less than 16. Here is another problem that requires estimating square roots. Akhil has a square piece of cloth of area 125 cm2. He wants to know if he can cut out a square handkerchief of side 15 cm. If not, he wants to know the maximum size handkerchief that can be cut out from this piece of cloth with an integer side length. 125 is not a perfect square. The nearest perfect squares are 112 = 121 and 122 = 144. So the largest square handkerchief with integer side length that can be cut out from this piece of cloth has side length 11 cm.

H. Hardy at the University of Cambridge, Hardy had come to visit Ramanujan at a hospital when he was ill. Hardy had ridden in a taxicab numbered 1729 and he remarked that 1729 was ‘rather a dull number,’ adding that he hoped that this was not a bad sign. Ramanujan immediately replied, “No, Hardy, it is a very interesting number. It is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways”. 1729 = 13 + 123 = 93 + 103. Because of this story, 1729 has since been known as the Hardy– Ramanujan Number. And numbers that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways are called taxicab numbers. The next two taxicab numbers after 1729 are 4104 and 13832. Find the two ways in which each of these can be expressed as the sum of two positive cubes. How did Ramanujan know this? Well, he loved numbers. All through his life, he tinkered with numbers. During Ramanujan’s time in Cambridge, his colleagues often marveled at his ability to see deep patterns in numbers that seemed arbitrary to others. His colleague, John Littlewood, once said, “Every positive integer was one of his [Ramanujan's] personal friends”. Try This"}

Cube Roots We know that 8 = 23. We call 2 the cube root of 8 and denote this by 2 = 8 3 . More generally, if y = x3, then x is the cube root of y. This is denoted by x = y 3 . So, 8 3 = 23 3 = 2.

Another way is to check if the factors can be grouped into triplet(s): 3375 = (3 × 3 × 3) × (5 × 5 × 5) = 33 × 53. This means 3375 15 3 = . Is 500 a perfect cube? 500 = 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 × 5.

In ancient Sanskrit works the term varga was used both for the square figure or its area, as well as the square power, and the term ghana was used both for the solid cube as well as the product of a number with itself three times. The fourth power was called varga-varga . These terms were used in India at least from the third century BCE. Aryabhata (499 CE) states “A square figure of four equal sides and the number representing its area are called varga. The product of two equal quantities is also called varga.” Thus, the term varga for square power has its origin in the graphical representation of a square figure. Why is the word ‘root’ (the root of a plant) used for the mathematical operation √ (square root, cube root, etc.)? It is because, in ancient India, the Sanskrit word mula, meaning root of a plant, basis, cause, origin, etc., was used for the mathematical operations of taking roots. In Sanskrit, varga-mula (the basis, cause, origin of the square) was used for square-root and ghana-mula was used for cube-root. This use of mula for the mathematical concept of root was subsequently emulated in Arabic and Latin through their corresponding words for the root of a plant — jidhr and radix respectively. The term mula for root has been used in India at least from the first century BCE. Another term used was pada (foot, basis, cause, origin).

Roxie has 7 dresses, 2 hats, and 3 pairs of shoes. How many different ways can Roxie dress up? Hint: Try drawing a diagram like the one above. Estu and Roxie came across a safe containing old stamps and coins that their great-grandfather had collected. It was secured with a 5-digit password. Since nobody knew the password, they had no option except to try every password until it opened. They were unlucky and the lock only opened with the last password, after they had tried all possible combinations. How many passwords did they end up checking? Instead of a 5-digit lock, let us assume we have a 2-digit lock and try to find out how many passwords are possible. There are 10 options for the first digit (0 to 9). For each of these, there are 10 options for the second digit (If 0 is the first digit then 00, 01, 02, 03, …, 09 are possible). Therefore the total number of combinations for a 2-digit lock is 10 × 10 = 100. Now, suppose we have a 3-digit lock. For each of the earlier 100 (2-digit) passwords there are 10 choices for the third digit. So, there are 100 × 10 = 1000 combinations for a 3-digit lock. You can list them all: 000, 001, 002, ….., 997, 997, 999. If you can’t solve a problem, try to find a simpler version of the problem that you can solve.

(ii) The number of stars in our galaxy is 1,00,00,00,00,000. (iii) The mass of the Earth is 59,76,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,000 kg. As the number of digits increases, it becomes difficult to read the numbers correctly. We may miscount the number of zeroes or place commas incorrectly. We will then read the wrong value. It is like getting ₹5,000 when you were supposed to get ₹50,000. The number of zeroes is more important than the initial digits in several cases. Can we use the exponential notation to simplify and read these very large numbers correctly? For example, the number 5900 can be expressed as — 5900 = 590 × 10 = 590 × 101 = 59 × 100 = 59 × 102 = 5.9 × 1000 = 5.9 × 103 = 0.59 × 10000 = 0.59 × 104. Any number can be written as the product of a number between 1 and 10 and a power of 10. For example, 5900 = 5.9 × 103 20800 = 2.08 × 104 80,00,000 = 8 × 106 Write the large-number facts we read just before in this form. In scientific notation or scientific form (also called standard form), we write numbers as x × 10 y, where x ≥ 1 and x < 10 is the coefficient and y, the exponent, is any integer. Often, the exponent y is more important than the coefficient x. When we write the 2 crore population of Mumbai as 2 × 107, the 7 is more important than the 2. Indeed, if the 2 is changed to 3, the population increases by one-half, i.e., 2 crore to 3 crore, whereas if the 7 is changed to 8, the change in population is 10 times, i.e., 2 crores to 20 crores. Therefore, the standard form explicitly mentions the exponent, which indicates the number of digits. If we say that the population of Kohima is 1,42,395, then it gives the impression that we are quite sure about this number up to the units place. When we use large numbers, in most cases, we are more concerned about how big a quantity or measure is, rather than the exact value. If we are only sure that the population is around 1 lakh 42 thousand, we can write it as 1.42 × 105. If we can only be certain that it is around 1 lakh 40 thousand, we write it as 1.4 × 105.

Let us continue this journey. Nanjundappa wants to donate jaggery equal to Roxie’s weight and wheat equal to Estu’s weight. He is wondering how much it would cost. What would be the worth (in rupees) of the donated jaggery? What would be the worth (in rupees) of the donated wheat? In order to find out, let us first describe the relationships among the quantities present. Worth of jaggery (in rupees) = Roxie’s weight in kg × cost of 1 kg jaggery. Worth of wheat (in rupees) = Estu’s weight in kg × cost of 1 kg wheat. Make necessary and reasonable assumptions for the unknowns and find the answers. Remember, Roxie is 13 years old and Estu is 11 years old. Assuming Roxie’s weight to be 45 kg and the cost of 1 kg of jaggery to be ₹70, the worth of donated jaggery is 45 × 70 = ₹3150. Assuming Estu’s weight to be 50 kg and the cost of 1 kg of wheat to be ₹50, the worth of donated wheat is 50 × 50 = ₹2500. Roxie wonders, “Instead of jaggery if we use 1-rupee coins, how many coins are needed to equal my weight?”. How can we find out? For questions like these, you can consider following the steps suggested below. 1. Guessing: Make an instinctive (quick) guess of what the answer could be, without any calculations. The practice of offering goods equal to the weight of a person, called Tulābhāra or Tulābhāram, is quite old and is still followed in many places in Southern India. It is a symbol of bhakti (surrendering oneself), a token of gratitude; it also supports the community."}

Calculating using estimation and approximation — (i) Describe the relationships among the quantities that are needed to find the answer. (ii) Make reasonable assumptions and approximations if the required information is not available. (iii) Compute and find the answer (and check how close your guess was). Would the number of coins be in hundreds, thousands, lakhs, crores, or even more? Make an instinctive guess. Find the answer by making necessary and reasonable assumptions and approximations for the unknowns. Remember, we are not looking for an exact answer but a reasonably close estimate. Estu asks, “What if we use 5-rupee coins or 10-rupee notes instead? How much money could it be?” Make an instinctive guess first. Then find out (make necessary and reasonable assumptions about the unknown details and find the answers). Estu says, “When I become an adult, I would like to donate notebooks worth my weight every year”. Roxie says, “When I grow up, I would like to do annadāna (offering grains or meals) worth my weight every year”. How many people might benefit from each of these offerings in a year? Again, guess first before finding out. Roxie and Estu overheard someone saying — “We did pādayātra for about 400 km to reach this place! We arrived early this morning.” How long ago would they have started their journey? Find answers by making necessary assumptions and approximations. Do guess first before calculating to check how close your guess was! How about measuring to find out the weight of a 1-rupee coin? Initially, your guesses may be very far off from the answer and it is perfectly fine! You will get better at it like as you do it often and in different situations. Guessing and estimating can build intuition about numbers and various quantities. Math Talk Note to the Teacher: Assumptions can vary greatly at times, and as a result the answers computed using these you can also vary. This is perfectly alright. Modelling the situation properly is crucial, which can also be done in different ways sometimes. The accuracy of the assumed numbers or quantities can get better with exposure and practice."}

He looked at it and smiled. “Around 4000 years ago, there flourished a civilisation in a region called Mesopotamia, in the western part of Asia, containing a major part of the present-day Iraq and a few other neighbouring countries. This is one of the ways they wrote their numbers!” Reema’s eyes lit up, “Seriously? These strange symbols were numbers?” Her curiosity was sparked, and questions started swirling in her head. Since when have humans been counting? What was their need for counting? What were they counting? Since when have people been writing numbers in the modern form? How would the Mesopotamians have written 20? 50? 100?"}
{"id": "class 8__maths__p65__c1", "text": "A Story of Numbers 49 Sensing her curiosity, her father started telling her how the idea of number and number representation evolved over the course of time, across geographies, to finally reach its modern efficient form. Get ready to travel back in time with them! Humans had the need to count even as early as the Stone Age. They were counting to determine the quantity of food they had, the number of animals in their livestock, details regarding trades of goods, the number of offerings given in rituals, etc. They also wanted to keep track of the passing days, e.g., to know and predict when important events such as the new moon, full moon, or onset of a season would occur. However, when they said or wrote down such numbers, they didn’t make use of the numbers that we use today. The structure of the modern oral and written numbers that we use today had its origin thousands of years ago in India. Ancient Indian texts, such as the Yajurveda Samhita, mentioned names of numbers based on powers of 10, almost as we say them orally today. For example, they listed names for the numbers one (eka), ten (dasha), hundred (shata), thousand (sahasra), ten thousand (āyuta), etc., all the way up to 1012 and beyond. The way we write our numbers today — using the digits 0 through 9 — also originated and were developed in India, around 2000 years ago. The first known instance of numbers being written using ten digits, including the digit 0 (which was then notated as a dot), occurs in the Bakhshali manuscript (c. 3rd century CE). Aryabhata (c. 499 CE) was the first mathematician to fully explain, and do elaborate scientific computations with the Indian system of 10 symbols. The Indian number system was transmitted to the Arab world by around 800 CE. It was popularised in the Arab world by the great Persian mathematician Al-Khwārizmī (after whom the word ‘algorithm’ is named) through his book On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals (c. 825) and by the noted philosopher Al-Kindi through his work On the Use of the Hindu Numerals (c. 830). From the Arab world, the Hindu numerals were transmitted to Europe and to parts of Africa by around 1100 CE. Though Al-Khwārizmī’s work on calculation with Hindu numerals was translated into Latin, it was the Italian mathematician Fibonacci who around the year 1200 really made the case to Europe to adopt the Indian numerals. However, the Roman numerals were so ingrained in European thinking and writing at the time that the Indian numerals did not gain widespread use for several more centuries. But eventually, during the European Renaissance and by the 17th century, not adopting them became impossible or it would impede scientific progress. Zero in the Bakhshali manuscript"}

The idea seems so simple nowadays that its significance and profound importance is no longer appreciated. Its simplicity lies in the way it facilitated calculations and placed arithmetic foremost among useful inventions.” — Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749 – 1827) Their use then spread to every continent, and are now used in every corner of the world. Because European scholars learned the Indian numerals from the Arab world, they called them ‛Arabic numerals’ to reflect their European perspective. On the other hand, as noted above, Arab scholars, such as Al-Khwārizmī and Al-Kindi, called them ‛Hindu numerals’. During the period of European colonisation, the European term Arabic numbers became widely used. However, in recent years, this mistake is being corrected in many textbooks and documents around the world, including in Europe. The most commonly used terminologies for the numbers we use today are ‛Hindu numerals’, ‛Indian numerals’, and the transitional ‛Hindu-Arabic numerals’. It is worth noting that the word ‛Hindu’ here does not refer to a religion, but rather a geography/people from whom these numbers came. The shape of the digits 0, 1, 2, ..., 9 used to write numbers in the Indian number system today evolved over a period of time, as shown below: Evolution of the digits used in the Indian number system Prior to the global adoption of the Indian system of numerals, different groups of people used different methods of representing numbers.

We will not be looking at different systems in a chronological order, but rather an order that shows us the main stages in the development of the idea of number representation. But first, let us explore some of the foundational ideas needed to count and to determine the number of objects in a given collection. The Mechanism of Counting Imagine that we are living in the Stone Age, say, around ten thousand years ago. Suppose we have a herd of cows. Here are some natural questions that we might ask about our herd — Q1. \u0007How do we ensure that all cows have returned safely after grazing? Q2. Do we have fewer cows than our neighbour? Q3. \u0007If there are fewer, how many more cows would we need so that we have the same number of cows as our neighbour? We need to tackle these questions without the use of the number names or written numbers of the Hindu number system. How do we do it? Here are some possible methods. Method 1: We could tackle the questions by using pebbles, sticks or any object that is available in abundance. Let us choose sticks. For every cow in the herd, we could keep a stick. The final collection of sticks tells us the number of cows, which can be used to check if any cows have gone missing. Math Talk"}
{"id": "class 8__maths__p68__c1", "text": "Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 52 This way of associating each cow with a stick, such that no two cows are associated or mapped to the same stick is called a one-to-one mapping.

How will you use such sticks to answer the other two questions (Q2 and Q3)? Method 2: Instead of objects, we could use a standard sequence of sounds or names. For example, we could use the sounds of the letters of any language. While counting, we could make a one-to-one mapping between the objects and the letters: that is, associate each object to be counted with a letter, following the letter-order. This mapping can then be used to come up with a way of verbally representing numbers. For example, we get the following number representation if we use English letters ‘a’ to ‘z’.

{"id": "class 8__maths__p69__c1", "text": "A Story of Numbers 53 An obvious limitation of using only the letters of the English alphabet in this form is that it cannot be used to count collections having more than 26 objects. How many numbers can you represent in this way using the sounds of the letters of your language? Method 3: We could use a sequence of written symbols as follows. Do you see a way of extending this method to represent bigger numbers as well? How? From the discussion above, we see that for counting and finding the size of a collection, we need a standard sequence of objects, or names, or written symbols, that has a fixed order. Let us call this standard sequence a number system. A collection of objects can be counted by making a one-to-one mapping between them and the standard sequence, following the sequence order. Since there is no end to numbers, the challenge is to come up with an unending standard sequence/number system that is easy to count with. Using sticks gives an unending standard sequence/number system. However, it is not convenient to count larger collections, as we will need as many sticks as the number of objects being counted. Using the sounds of the letters of a language, as in Method 2, is convenient for the counting process but is not an unending standard sequence/number system. The standard sequence/number system given in Method 3 was actually the system used in Europe before it got replaced by the Hindu number system. It is called the Roman number system. It was widely used in Europe for centuries, and was convenient for many purposes, but had the similar drawback that one cannot write arbitrarily large numbers without introducing more and more symbols.

Some groups of people had numbers represented both by physical objects as well as by names, while others like the Chinese had all three forms of representation. The symbols occurring in a written number system are called numerals. For example, 0, 1, 5, 36, 193, etc., are some of the numerals occurring in the Hindu number system. Numerals representing ‘smaller’ numbers always had names, and so a number system composed of written symbols always went hand in hand with a number system composed of names, as is the case with the modern-day Hindu system. Figure it Out 1. Suppose you are using the number system that uses sticks to represent numbers, as in Method 1. Without using either the number names or the numerals of the Hindu number system, give a method for adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing two numbers or two collections of sticks. 2. One way of extending the number system in Method 2 is by using strings with more than one letter — for example, we could use ‘aa’ for 27. How can you extend this system to represent all the numbers? There are many ways of doing it! 3. Try making your own number system. 3.2 Some Early Number Systems I.

Tally Marks on Bones and Other Surfaces One of the oldest methods of number representation is by making notches — marks cut on a surface such as a bone or a wall of a cave. These marks are also called tally marks. In this method, a mark is made for each object that is being counted. So the final collection of marks represents the total number of objects. This method is very similar to the method of using sticks to count (Method 1), except for the fact that a mark is made instead of adding a stick. Archaeologists have discovered bones dating back more than 20,000 years that seem to have tally marks. The oldest known such bones with markings that are thought to represent numbers are the Ishango bone and the Lebombo bone. The Ishango bone, dating back 20,000 to 35,000 years, was discovered in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It features notches arranged in columns, possibly indicating calendrical systems. The Lebombo bone, discovered in South Africa, is an even older tally stick with 29 notches, estimated to be around 44,000 years old. It is considered one of the oldest mathematical artefacts, and may have served as a tally stick or lunar calendar. Lebombo bone Ishango bone"}

Number Names Obtained by Counting in Twos A group of indigenous people in Australia called the Gumulgal had the following words for their numbers. Can you see how their number names are formed? The number name for 3 is composed of number names of 2 and 1. The number name for 4 is composed of two occurrences of the number name for 2. Can you see how the names of the other numbers are formed? The numbers are counted in 2s, using which the number names are formed: 3 = 2 + 1, 4 = 2 + 2, 5 = 2 + 2 + 1, 6 = 2 + 2 + 2. Gumulgal called any number greater than 6 ras. There is a very interesting and puzzling historical phenomenon associated with this number system.

Historians have wondered how this happened. One theory is that these three groups of people may have had common ancestors, who used this number system. In course of time, their descendants migrated to these places. Even though the number system of Gumulgal had number names for numbers only till 6, we can see the emergence of an idea here. Counting in 2s is more efficient for representing numbers than, for example, a tally system. A general form which this idea has taken in different number systems is as follows: count in groups of a certain number (like 2 in the case of Gumulgal’s system), and use the word or symbol associated with this group size to represent bigger numbers. Some of the commonly used group sizes in different number systems have been 2, 5, 10 and 20. You can find the idea of counting by 5s in the Roman system (Table 1). One of the phenomena that could have led people to this idea might be the human limit for immediately knowing the size of a collection at a glance. Let us try out the following activity. Quickly count the number of objects in each of the following boxes: Up to what group size could you immediately see the number of objects without counting? Most humans find it difficult to count groups having 5 or more objects in a single glance. This limit of perception could have prompted people using tally marks to replace every group of, say, 5 marks, with a new symbol, as seen in the system shown in Table 1. This idea of counting in a certain group size and using it to represent numbers is an important idea in the history of the evolution of number systems. Math Talk"}

How would you represent a number like 1345 in a system that counts only by 5s? Even though counting in groups of a particular size and using it for number representation is more efficient than the tally system, this method can still become cumbersome for larger numbers. The next system shows a refinement of this idea. IV. The Roman Numerals We have already seen the Roman number system till 20 (Table 1). We have seen that it uses I for 1, V for 5, X for 10. To get the Roman numeral for any number till 39, it is first grouped into as many 10s as possible, the remaining is grouped into as many 5s as possible, and finally the remaining is grouped into 1s. Example: Let us take the number 27. 27 = 10 + 10 + 5 + 1 + 1 So, 27 in Roman numerals is XXVII. Instead of representing 50 as XXXXX, a new symbol is given to it: L. Following the way the number 4 is represented as 1 less than 5 — that is, as IV — 40 is represented as 10 less than 50 — that is, as XL. However, people using this system were not always consistent with this practice. Sometimes, 40 was also represented as XXXX. The Roman number system introduces newer symbols to represent certain bigger numbers. Let us call all these numbers that have a new basic symbol as landmark numbers.

It spread throughout Europe with the expansion of the Roman empire. Despite the relative efficiency of the Roman system, it doesn’t lend itself to an easy performance of arithmetic operations, particularly multiplication and division. Example: Try adding the following numbers without converting them to Hindu numerals: (a) CCXXXII + CCCCXIII Let us find the total number of Is, Xs, and Cs, and group them starting from the largest landmark number. Apparently, it looks like the largest landmark number is C, but note that 5 Cs (100s) make a D (500).

As has been seen, a process of multiplying two numbers involves the multiplication of landmark numbers. When the landmark numbers are powers of a number, then their product is another landmark number. This fact simplifies the process of multiplication. However, this is not the case with the Roman numerals, which is why multiplication using them is difficult. Thus, a number system whose landmark numbers are powers of a number, i.e., a number system with a base, is efficient not only in number representation but also in its utility in carrying out arithmetic operations. The idea of a number system with a base was a turning point in the history of the evolution of number systems. Our modern Hindu number system is built on this structure. Abacus that Makes Use of the Decimal System In around the 11th century, even the people still using the Roman numerals started using a calculating device — the abacus — constructed using a decimal system. It was a board with lines, as shown in the Fig. 3.1. Starting from the line that stood for 1, each successive line stood for a successive power of 10. Numbers were represented in it as follows: the given number was first grouped into the landmark numbers (powers of 10), in exactly the same way we have been grouping them so far. For each power of 10, as many counters were placed on its line as the number of times it occurred Fig. 3.1: Abacus"}

To get an idea of how the abacus was used for calculations, let us consider a simple addition problem: 2907 + 43. The two numbers were taken on either side of the vertical partition. How would you use this to find the sum? The counters along each line were brought together. What is to be done if the total in a line exceeded 10? Hint: In this problem, the 7 ones and the 3 ones together make 10 ones which contributes a counter to the line representing 10s. III. Shortcomings of the Egyptian System Despite being a number system that enabled relatively efficient number representations for numbers till a crore (107), and relatively easy computations, the Egyptian system had a drawback. If larger and larger numbers needed to be represented, then there was a need for inventing an unending sequence of symbols for higher and higher powers of 10.

The Mesopotamian Number System In the beginning, the number system used in ancient Mesopotamia had different symbols for different landmark numbers. In later times, it became a base-60 system, also called the sexagesimal system, with a very efficient number representation. It has puzzled many why they chose base 60. Different theories exist to explain this, ranging from the connection between 60 and the periods of some important events (like the length of their lunar month which had 30 days, or the time taken for the Sun to complete one revolution around the Earth when Earth is taken to be stationary), the ease of representing fractions (we will not go into this here), their earlier sequence of landmark numbers — 1, 10, 60, 600, 3600, 36000,… — getting reduced to only the powers of 60, and so on. The influence of the Mesopotamian sexagesimal system, also known as the Babylonian number system, can be seen even now in our units of time measurements — 1 hour = 60 minutes and 1 minute = 60 seconds. This system used the symbol for 1 and for 10. Let us now briefly pause on the study of their number system, and ideate on how one can build an efficient number system using the Mesopotamian features seen so far. Math Talk"}

We can simply represent this number as which can be read as ten 60s and one 40, just as we have written in the equation. Example: Let us try another number — 7530. 7530 = (2) ×3600 + (5) × 60 + 30 So, its representation would be Note that when a number is grouped into powers of 60 for its representation, no power of 60 can occur 60 or more times. If this happens, then 60 of them can be grouped to form the next power of 60. For example, consider the expression — (1) × 3600 + (70) × 60 + 2 = (1) × 602 + (60 + 10) × 60 + 2 = (1) × 602 + 602 + (10) × 60 + 2 = (2) × 602 + (10) × 60 + 2 Therefore, any number can be represented using the numerals from 1 – 59, along with the numerals for landmark numbers. Now, what if we make the representation even more compact by dropping the symbols for the different powers of 60 altogether?"}
{"id": "class 8__maths__p89__c1", "text": "A Story of Numbers 73 This is exactly what the Mesopotamians did! In their numeral, the rightmost set of symbols showed the number of 1s, the set of symbols to its left showed the number of 60s, the next showed the number of 3600s and so on. Whenever there was no occurrence of a power of 60, a blank space was given in that position. It does not seem that the Mesopotamians arrived at this idea in the same way we did. Some scholars suggest that the similarity of symbols given to the landmark numbers 1 and 60 in their earlier number system, and an accidental usage of them, might have made them stumble upon this idea. Figure it Out 1. Represent the following numbers in the Mesopotamian system — (i) 63 (ii) 132 (iii) 200 (iv) 60 (v) 3605 Thus, we can see how the Mesopotamian system removes the need for generating an unending sequence of symbols for the landmark numbers by making use of the positions where the symbols are written. Such a number system (having a base) that makes use of the position of each symbol in determining the landmark number that it is associated with is called a positional number system or a place value system. This idea of place value marks the highest point in the history of evolution of number systems, and gives a very elegant solution to the problem of representing the unending sequence of numbers using only a finite number of different symbols! The Mesopotamian system however cannot be considered a fully developed place value system. It has certain defects that lead to confusion while reading a number. Look at the representation of 60. What will be the representation for 3,600? While writing the numerals, the spacing between symbols was not given the way we are giving it here. It was also difficult to maintain a consistent spacing for blanks across different manuscripts written by different people. These created ambiguities. For example, consider the representations of the following numbers —"}
{"id": "class 8__maths__p90__c1", "text": "Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 74 Because of the ambiguity in finding which symbols correspond to which powers of 60, the same numeral can be read in different ways. Even in our representation which uses uniform spacing between symbols for different powers of 60, it is difficult to know the number of blanks between two sets of symbols, as in the representation of 36002. To address the issue arising out of blank spaces, the later Mesopotamians used a brilliant idea of assigning a ‘placeholder’ symbol to denote a blank space. This is like the 0 (zero) we use in our system. Thus, zero — the symbol that shows nothingness — is indispensable as a placeholder in a place value system in which numbers are written in an unambiguous manner. Even with the problem arising out of blank spaces solved, other ambiguities still remained in the system. For example, the placeholder symbol was primarily used in the middle of numbers and not at the end; so they would not use it to represent a number like (what we would write as) 3600. II. The Mayan Number System In Central America, there flourished a civilisation known as the Mayan civilisation that made great intellectual and cultural progress between the 3rd and 10th centuries CE.

Some scholars feel that this might have something to do with their calendars. They used a dot for 1, and a bar for 5. These were used to denote numbers from 1 to 19. The symbols associated with different landmark numbers were written one below the other with the lowermost set of symbols corresponding to the number of 1s, the set above corresponding to the number of 20s, the set above to the number of 360s and so on. Represent the following numbers using the Mayan system: (i) 77 (ii) 100 (iii) 361 (iv) 721 Because the Mayan system is not an actual base-20 system, it lacks the advantages that a system with a base has for computations. Nevertheless, their place value notation and their use of a placeholder symbol for zero is considered an important advance in the history of number systems. A curious fact is that we can still find the use of base-20 in the number names of some European languages. III. The Chinese Number System The Chinese used two number systems — a written system for recording quantities, and a system making use of rods for performing computations. The numerals in the rod-based number system are called rod numerals. Here we discuss the rod numerals, which are more efficient in writing and computing with numbers than the written system of the Chinese. The rod numerals developed in China by at least by 3rd century AD and were used till the 17th century. It was a decimal system (base-10). The symbols for 1 to 9 were as follows:"}

The use of 0 as a digit, and indeed as a number, was a breakthrough that truly changed the world of mathematics and science. In Indian mathematics, indeed, zero was not just used as a placeholder in the place value system, but was also given the status of a number in its own right, on par with other numbers. The arithmetic properties of the number 0 (e.g., that 0 plus any number is the same number, and that 0 times any number is zero) were explicitly used by Aryabhata in his Āryabhaṭīya in 499 CE to compute with and do elaborate scientific computations using Hindu numerals. The use of 0 as a number like any other number, on which one can perform the basic arithmetic operations, was codified by Brahmagupta in his work Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta in 628 CE, as we learned in an earlier grade. By introducing 0 as a number, along with the negative numbers, Brahmagupta created what in modern terms is called a ring, i.e., a set of numbers that is closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication (i.e., any two numbers in the set can be added, subtracted, or multiplied to get another number in that set). These new ideas laid the foundations for modern mathematics, and particularly for the areas of algebra and analysis. Hopefully, this gives you a sense of all the ideas that went into writing and computing with numbers in the way that we do today. The discovery of 0 and the resulting Indian number system is truly one of the greatest, most creative, and most influential inventions of all time — appearing constantly in our daily lives and forming the basis of much of modern science, technology, computing, accounting, surveying, and more.

The definition precisely states the conditions a quadrilateral has to satisfy to be called a rectangle. Are there other ways to define a rectangle? Let us consider the following problem related to the construction of rectangles. A Carpenter’s Problem A carpenter needs to put together two thin strips of wood, as shown in Fig. 1, so that when a thread is passed through their endpoints, it forms a rectangle. She already has one 8 cm long strip. What should be the length of the other strip? Where should they both be joined? Let us first model the structure that the carpenter has to make. The strips can be modelled as line segments. They are the diagonals of the quadrilateral formed by their endpoints.

Thus, the quadrilateral is a rectangle. Now we know how the wooden strips have to be put together to form the vertices of a rectangle! They should be equal and connected at their midpoints. This method is actually used in practice to make rectangles. Carpenters in Europe use this method to get a rectangular frame. It is also known that farmers in Mozambique, a country in Africa, use this method while constructing houses to get the base of the house in a rectangular shape. The Process of Finding Properties As we have been seeing from lower grades, properties of geometric objects such as parallel lines, angles, and triangles can be deduced through geometric reasoning. We will continue to deduce properties of special types of quadrilaterals in this chapter. Once you have deduced a property of a quadrilateral, it is good to verify it with a real-world quadrilateral, either the quadrilateral constructed on paper or simply a surface having the shape of the quadrilateral. If you are not able to figure out the property using deduction, you could experiment by taking real-world quadrilaterals and observing the property through measurement. Note that these observations give useful insights about the property, but with them, we can only form a conjecture, that is, a statement about which we are highly confident, but not yet sure if it always holds true. For example, constructing a few rectangles and observing through measurement that their diagonals bisect each other does not necessarily mean that this will always be the case — can we be sure that the 1000th rectangle we construct will also have this property? The only way we can be sure of this property is by justifying or proving the statement, just as we did in Deduction 2.

Thus, a rectangle can simply be defined as follows — Rectangle: A rectangle is a quadrilateral in which the angles are all 90°. Let us list the properties of a rectangle. Property 1: All the angles of a rectangle are 90°. Property 2: The opposite sides of a rectangle are equal. Are the opposite sides of a rectangle parallel? They definitely seem so. This fact can be justified using one of the transversal properties. Notice that AB acts as a transversal to AD and BC, and that ∠A + ∠B = 90° + 90° = 180°. When the sum of the internal angles on the same side of the transversal is 180°, the lines are parallel.

What do you observe about their parities? Repeat this with other sets of 4 numbers. Is there a way to explain why this happens? Hint: \u0007Think of the rules for parity of the sum or difference of two numbers. Explanation 1: Let us consider any of the 8 expressions formed by four numbers a, b, c, and d. When one of its signs is switched, its value always increases or decreases by an even number! Let us see why. Consider one of the expressions: a + b – c – d. Replacing +b by – b, we get a – b – c – d. By how much has the number changed? It has changed by (a + b – c – d) – (a – b – c – d) = a + b – c – d – a + b + c + d (notice how the signs changed when we opened the second set of brackets) = 2b (this is an even number). If the difference between two numbers is even, can they have different parities? No! So either both are even or both are odd. Now, let us see what happens when a negative sign is switched to a positive sign. Replace any negative sign in the expression a + b – c – d with a positive sign and find the difference between the two numbers. What do you conclude from this observation? Starting from any expression, we can get 7 expressions by switching one or more ‘+’ and ‘–’ signs. Thus, all the expressions have the same parity! Explanation 2: We know that odd ± odd = even even ± even = even odd ± even = odd. We have seen that the parity of a + b and a – b is the same, regardless of the parities of a and b. In short, a ± b have the same parity. By the same argument, a ± b + c and a ± b – c have the same parity. Extending this further, we can say that all the expressions a ± b ± c ± d have the same parity. Math Talk"}

We can justify this in two different ways — • We know 4m is even and 2q is even for any integers m and q. Therefore, their sum will also be even. • The expression 4m + 2q is equal to the expression 2(2m + q). Here, the expression 2(2m + q) means 2 times 2m + q. In other words, 2 is a factor of this expression. Therefore, this expression will always give an even number for any integers m and q. For example, if m = 4 and q = – 9, the expression 4m + 2q becomes 4 × 4 + 2 × (–9) = – 2, which is an even number. In the expression x 2 + 2, x 2 is even if x is even, and x 2 is odd if x is odd.

When you add an odd number to an even number we get a multiple of 6. We know that multiples of 6 are all even numbers. The sum of an odd number and an even number will be an odd number. Therefore, this statement is never true. We can also explain this algebraically. Suppose, (2n) + (2m + 1) = 6j, where 2n is an even number, 2m + 1 is an odd number, and 6j is a multiple of 6. Then 2n + 2m = 6j – 1 2 (n + m) = 6j – 1 which means 2(n + m), which is an even number, should be equal to 6j – 1, which is an odd number. This is never true. What Remains?

Let us revisit them. Divisibility by 10, 5, and 2: If the units digit of a number is ‘0’, then it is divisible by 10. Let us understand why this works through algebra. We can write the general form of a number in the Indian system using a set of letter-numbers. For example, a 5-digit number can be expressed as, edcba denoting e × 10000 + d × 1000 + c × 100 + b × 10 + a. The letter-numbers e, d, c, b, and a denote each digit of a 5-digit number. Any number can be written in general as … dcba, where the letter- numbers a, b, c and d represent the units, tens, hundreds and thousands digit, respectively, and so on. As a sum of place values, this number is — … +1000d + 100c + 10b + a. (For example, in the number 4075, d = 4, c = 0, b = 7, and a = 5.) We know that each place value, with the exception of the units place, is a multiple of 10. So, 10b, 100c, … all will be multiples of 10. Hence, the number will be divisible by 10 if and only if the units digit a is 0. Similarly, explain using algebra why the divisibility shortcuts for 5, 2, 4, and 8 work. Let us now examine shortcuts to check divisibility by some other numbers and explain why they work! A Shortcut for Divisibility by 9 Can you say, without actually calculating, which of these numbers are divisible by 9: 999, 909, 900, 90, 990? All of them."}
{"id": "class 8__maths__p140__c1", "text": "Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 124 Can we say that any number made up of only the digits ‘0’ and ‘9’, in any order, will always be divisible by 9? Yes, if each digit is either 0 or 9, then each term in its expanded form will be 9 × or 0 × (the ‘ ’ denotes a place value). This means each term will be a multiple of 9, for example, 99009 = 9 × 10000 + 9 × 1000 + 0 × 100 + 0 × 10 + 9 × 1. But this shortcut alone cannot identify all the multiples of 9. Unlike the numbers 2, 5, and 10, we cannot identify the multiples of 9 by just looking at the unit’s digit. 99 and 109 are two numbers with 9 as the units digit; but 99 is divisible by 9, while 109 is not. Is 10 divisible by 9? If not, what is the remainder? Check the divisibility of other multiples of 10 (10, 20, 30, ...) by 9. You will notice that for any multiple of 10, the remainder is the same as the number of tens. Similarly, look at the remainder when the multiples of 100 (100, 200, 300, … ) are divided by 9. What do you notice? The remainder is the same as the number of hundreds for any multiple of 100. Using this observation, find the remainder when 427 is divided by 9. We see that 427 has 4 hundreds; thus, its corresponding remainder (upon division by 9) would be 4. 427 has 2 tens, and its corresponding remainder would be 2. We have 7 units also remaining. Adding all the remainders, we get 4 + 2 + 7 = 13. We can make one more group of 9 with 13, leaving a remainder of 4. Therefore, 427 ÷ 9 gives a remainder of 4. 99 99 1 1 9 1 9 1 9 1 99 1 9 1 9 1 99 1 99 1 99 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 400 20 7 99 1 9 1 9 1 99 1 99 1 99 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 9 (Remainder)"}
{"id": "class 8__maths__p141__c1", "text": "Number Play 125 Will this work with bigger numbers? You can see that this is true for any place value: 1 = 0 + 1 10 = 9 + 1 100 = 99 + 1 1000 = 999 + 1 10000 = 9999 + 1, and so on. Each digit thus denotes the remainder when the corresponding place value is divided by 9. For example, to find the remainder of 7309 when divided by 9, we can just add all the digits — 7 + 3 + 0 + 9 — to get 19. This can be seen as follows: 7 × 1000 + 3 × 100 + 0 × 10 + 9 × 1 = 7 × (999 + 1) + 3 × (99 + 1) + 0 × (9 + 1) + 9 × (0+1) = (7 × 999 + 3 × 99 + 0 × 9 + 9 × 0) + (7 × 1 + 3 × 1 + 0 × 1 + 9 × 1) = (7 × 999 + 3 × 99 + 0 × 9 + 9 × 0) + (7 + 3 + 0 + 9). This means that the number 7309 is 19 more than some multiple of 9. The digits 1 and 9 can further be added to get 1 + 9 = 10. Now, we can say that 7309 is 10 more than a multiple of 9. And repeating this step for the number 10, we get the remainder to be 1 + 0 = 1, meaning 7309 is 1 more than a multiple of 9. Therefore, 7309 ÷ 9 gives a remainder of 1. A number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Also, we can add the digits of a number repeatedly till a single digit is obtained. This single digit is the remainder when the number is divided by 9. Look at each of the following statements. Which are correct and why? (i) If a number is divisible by 9, then the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. 9 1 99 1 999 1 9999 1 7 × 1000 3 × 100 9 × 1 999 1 999 1 999 1 999 1 999 1 999 1 999 1 99 1 99 1 99 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 7 × 999 3 × 99 9 3 7 999 999 999 999 999 999 999 99 99 99 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 This is a multiple of 9 So, we need to just consider this part (i.e., 7 + 3 + 9 = 19) This is a multiple of 9 So, we need to just consider this part"}

It is a strategy game for two players where the goal is to form lines of three pawns to eliminate the opponent’s pawns or block their movement. Gameplay 1. Each player starts with 9 pawns. The players take turns in placing their pawns on the marked intersections. An intersection can have at most one pawn. 2. Once all the pawns are placed, the players take turns to move one of their pawns to adjacent empty intersections to form lines of three. The line can be horizontal or vertical. 3. Once a player makes a line with their pawns they can remove any one of the opponent’s pawns as long as it is not a part of one of their lines. A player wins if the opponent has less than 3 pawns or is unable to make a move."}

Algebra can also be used to justify or prove claims and conjectures (like the many properties you saw in the previous chapter) and to solve problems of various kinds. Distributivity is a property relating multiplication and addition that is captured concisely using algebra. In this chapter, we explore different types of multiplication patterns and show how they can be described in the language of algebra by making use of distributivity. 6.1 Some Properties of Multiplication Increments in Products Consider the multiplication of two numbers, say, 23 × 27. 1. \u0007By how much does the product increase if the first number (23) is increased by 1? 2. \u0007What if the second number (27) is increased by 1? 3. \u0007How about when both numbers are increased by 1? Do you see a pattern that could help generalise our observations to the product of any two numbers?

We usually skip writing the ‘×’ symbol before or after brackets, just as in the case of expressions like 5a, xy, etc. We can also similarly expand (a + b) c using the distributive property as follows — (a + b) c = c (a + b) (commutativity of multiplication) = ca + cb (distributivity) = ac + bc (commutativity of multiplication) We can use the distributive property to find, in general, how much a product increases if one or both the numbers in the product are increased by 1. Suppose the initial two numbers are a and b. If one of the numbers, say b, is increased by 1, then we have — Now let us see what happens if both numbers in a product are increased by 1.

Then, by the distributive property, we have Thus, the product ab increases by a + b + 1 when each of a and b are increased by 1. What would we get if we had expanded (a + 1) (b + 1) by first taking (b + 1) as a single term? Try it? What happens when one of the numbers in a product is increased by 1 and the other is decreased by 1? Will there be any change in the product? Let us again take the product ab of two numbers a and b. If a is increased by 1 and b is decreased by 1, then their product will be (a + 1) (b – 1). Expanding this, we get Will the product always increase? Find 3 examples where the product decreases. What happens when a and b are negative integers? Check by substituting different values for a and b in each of the above cases. For example, a = –5, b = 8; a = –4, b = –5; etc. We have seen that integers also satisfy the distributive property, that is, if x, y and z are any three integers, then x (y + z) = xy + xz. Thus, the expressions we have for increase of products hold when the letter-numbers take on negative integer values as well. Recall that two algebraic expressions are equal if they take on the same values when their letter-numbers are replaced by numbers. These (a + 1) (b + 1) = (a + 1) b + (a + 1) 1 = ab + (b + a + 1) Increase (a + 1) (b + 1) = (a + 1) b + (a + 1) 1 Again applying the distributive property, we obtain (23 + 1) (27 + 1) = (23 + 1) 27 + (23 + 1) 1 = 23 × 27 + (27 + 23 + 1) Increase If a = 23, and, b = 27, we get (a + 1) (b – 1) = (a + 1) b – (a + 1) 1 = ab + b – (a + 1) = ab + b – a – 1 Increase (23 + 1) (27 – 1) = (23 + 1) 27 – (23 + 1) 1 = 23 × 27 + 27 – (23 + 1) = 23 × 27 + 27 – 23 – 1 Increase If a = 23, and b = 27, we get"}

Mathematical statements that express the equality of two algebraic expressions, such as a (b + 8) = ab + 8a, (a + 1) (b – 1) = ab + b – a – 1, etc., are called identities. By how much will the product of two numbers change if one of the numbers is increased by m and the other by n? If a and b are the initial numbers being multiplied, they become a + m and b + n. (a + m) (b + n) = (a + m)b + (a + m)n = ab + mb + an + mn The increase is an + bm + mn. Notice that the product is the sum of the product of each term of (a + m) with each term of (b + n).

Can you see how this identity can be used when one or both numbers are decreased? For example, let us reconsider the case when one number is increased by 1 and the other decreased by 1. Let us write the product (a + 1) (b – 1) as (a + 1) (b + (–1). Taking m = 1 and n = –1 in Identity 1, we have ab + (1) × b + a × (–1) + (1) × (–1) = ab + b – a – 1, which is the same expression that we obtain earlier. Use Identity 1 to find how the product changes when (i) one number is decreased by 2 and the other increased by 3; (ii) both numbers are decreased, one by 3 and the other by 4. Verify the answers by finding the products without converting the subtractions to additions. Generalising this, we can find the product (a + u) (b – v) as follows. (a + u) (b – v) = (a + u) b – (a + u) v = ab + ub – (av + uv) = ab + ub – av – uv. Check that this is the same as taking m = u and n = –v in Identity 1. As in Identity 1, the product (a + u) (b – v) is the sum of the product of each term of a + u (a and u) with each term of b – v (b and (–v)). Notice that the signs of the terms in the products can be determined using the usual rules of integer multiplication. Expand (i) (a – u) (b + v), (ii) (a – u) (b – v). We get (a – u) (b + v) = ab – ub + av – uv, and (a – u) (b – v) = ab – ub – av + uv. The distributive property is not restricted to two terms within a bracket. Example 1: Expand 3a 2 (a – b + 1 5). 3a 2 (a – b + 1 5) = (3a 2 × a) – (3a 2 × b) + (3a 2 × 1 5 ). The terms can be simplified as follows — 3a 2 × a = 3 2 × (a × a).

Can any two terms be added to get a single term? For example, can 3 2 a2 and 3 10 a be added to get a single term? We see that no two terms have exactly the same letter-numbers, which would have allowed them to be simplified into a single term. So, a further simplification of the expression is not possible. Recall that we call terms having the same letter-numbers like terms. Example 2: Expand (a + b) (a + b). We have (a + b) (a + b) = (a+b) a + (a + b)b = a × a + b × a + ab + b × b = a2 + ba + ab + b2 Since ba = ab, we have two terms having the same letter-numbers ab (or, that are like terms), and so can be added — ba + ab = ab + ab = 2ab So we get (a + b) (a + b) = a2 + 2ab + b2. Example 3: Expand (a + b) (a2 + 2ab + b2).

A Pinch of History The distributive property of multiplication over addition was implicit in the calculations of mathematicians in many ancient civilisations, particularly in ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, China, and India. For example, the mathematicians Euclid (in geometric form) and Āryabhaṭa (in algebraic form) used the distributive law in an implicit manner extensively in their mathematical and scientific works. The first explicit statement of the distributive property was given by Brahmagupta in his work Brahmasphuṭasiddhānta (Verse 12.55), who referred to the use of the property for multiplication as khaṇḍa-guṇanam (multiplication by parts). His verse states, “The multiplier is broken up into two or more parts whose sum is equal to it; the multiplicand is then multiplied by each of these and the results added”. That is, if there are two parts, then using letter symbols this is equivalent to the identity (a + b) c = ac + bc. In the next verse (Verse 12.56), Brahmagupta further describes a method for doing fast multiplication using this distributive property, which we explore further in the next section. Figure it Out 1. Observe the multiplication grid below. Each number inside the grid is formed by multiplying two numbers. If the middle number of a 3 × 3 frame is given by the expression pq, as shown in the figure, write the expressions for the other numbers in the grid. x 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 2 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 3 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30 4 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40 5 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 6 6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60 7 7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 70 8 8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72 80 9 9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81 90 10 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 3 × 5 3 × 6 3 × 7 4 × 5 4 × 6 4 × 7 5 × 5 5 × 6 5 × 7 pq"}

{"id": "class 8__maths__p177__c1", "text": "Proportional Reasoning-1 161 7.2 Ratios We use the notion of a ratio to represent such proportional relationships in mathematics. We can say that the ratio of width to height of image A is 60 : 40. The numbers 60 and 40 are called the terms of the ratio.\u0007 The ratio of width to height of image C is 30 : 20, and that of image D is 90 : 60. In a ratio of the form a : b, we can say that for every ‘a’ units of the first quantity, there are ‘b’ units of the second quantity. So, in image A, we can say that for every 60 mm of width, there are 40 mm of height. We can say that the ratios of width to height of images A, C, and D are proportional because the terms of these ratios change by the same factor. Let us see how. Image A — 60 : 40 Multiplying both the terms by 1 2, we get 60 × 1 2 : 40 × 1 2 which is 30 : 20, the ratio of width to height in image C. By what factor should we multiply the ratio 60 : 40 (image A) to get 90 : 60 (image D)? A more systematic way to compare whether the ratios are proportional is to reduce them to their simplest form and see if these simplest forms are the same. 7.3 Ratios in their Simplest Form We can reduce ratios to their simplest form by dividing the terms by their HCF. In image A, the terms are 60 and 40. What is the HCF of 60 and 40? It is 20. Dividing the terms by 20, we get the ratio of image A to be 3 : 2 in its simplest form. The ratio of image D is 90 : 60. Dividing both terms by 30 (HCF of 90 and 60), we get the simplest form to be 3 : 2. So the ratios of images A and D are proportional as well. What is the simplest form of the ratios of images B and E? The ratio of image B is 40 : 20; in its simplest form, it is 2 : 1. The ratio of image E is 60 : 60; in its simplest form, it is 1 : 1."}
{"id": "class 8__maths__p178__c1", "text": "Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 162 These ratios are not the same as 3 : 2. So, we can say that the ratios of width to height of images B and E are not proportional to the ratios of images A, C, and D. When two ratios are the same in their simplest forms, we say that the ratios are in proportion, or that the ratios are proportional. We use the ‘::’ symbol to indicate that they are proportional. So a : b :: c : d indicates that the ratios a : b and c : d are proportional. Thus, 60 : 40 :: 30 : 20 and 60 : 40 :: 90 : 60. 7.4 Problem Solving with Proportional Reasoning Example 1: Are the ratios 3 : 4 and 72 : 96 proportional? 3 : 4 is already in its simplest form. To find the simplest form of 72 : 96, we need to divide both terms by their HCF. What is the HCF of 72 and 96? The HCF of 72 and 96 is 24. Dividing both terms by 24, we get 3 : 4. Since both ratios in their simplest form are the same, they are proportional. Example 2: Kesang wanted to make lemonade for a celebration. She made 6 glasses of lemonade in a vessel and added 10 spoons of sugar to the drink. Her father expected more people to join the celebration. So he asked her to make 18 more glasses of lemonade. To make the lemonade with the same sweetness, how many spoons of sugar should she add? To maintain the same sweetness, the ratio of the number of glasses of lemonade to the number of spoons of sugar should be proportional. For 6 glasses of lemonade, she added 10 spoons of sugar. The ratio of glasses of lemonade to spoons of sugar is 6 : 10. If she needs to make 18 more glasses of lemonade, how many spoons of sugar should she use? We can model this problem as — 6 : 10 :: 18 : ? We know that each term in the ratio must change by the same factor, for the ratios to be proportional. How can we find the factor of change in the ratio? The first term has increased from 6 to 18. To find the factor of change, we can divide 18 by 6 to get 3."}
{"id": "class 8__maths__p179__c1", "text": "Proportional Reasoning-1 163 The second term should also change by the same factor. When 10 increases by a factor of 3, it becomes 30. Thus, 6 : 10 :: 18 : 30. So, she should use 30 spoons of sugar to make 18 glasses of lemonade with the same sweetness as earlier. Example 3: Nitin and Hari were constructing a compound wall around their house. Nitin was building the longer side, 60 ft in length, and Hari was building the shorter side, 40 ft in length. Nitin used 3 bags of cement but Hari used only 2 bags of cement. Nitin was worried that the wall Hari built would not be as strong as the wall he built because she used less cement. Is Nitin correct in his thinking? In Nitin and Hari’s case, we should compare the ratio of the length of the wall to the bags of cement used by each of them and see whether they are proportional. The ratio in Nitin’s case is 60 : 3, i.e., 20 : 1 (in its simplest form). The ratio in Hari’s case is 40 : 2, i.e., 20 : 1 (in its simplest form). Since both ratios are proportional, the walls are equally strong. Nitin should not worry! Example 4: In my school, there are 5 teachers and 170 students.

What is the ratio of Neelima’s age to her mother’s age? What would be the ratio of their ages when Neelima is 12 years old? Would it remain the same? The ratio of Neelima’s age to her mother’s age when Neelima is 3 years old is 3 : 30 (her mother’s age is 10 times Neelima’s age). In the simplest form, it is 1 : 10. When Neelima is 12 years old (i.e., 9 years later), the ratio of their ages will be 12 : 39 (9 years later, her mother would be 39 years old). In the simplest form, it is 4 : 13. When we add (or subtract) the same number from the terms of a ratio, the ratio changes and is not necessarily proportional to the original ratio. Example 7: Fill in the missing numbers for the following ratios that are proportional to 14 : 21. ______ : 42 6 : ______ 2 : ______ In the first ratio, we don’t know the first term. But the second term is 42. It is 2 times the second term of the ratio 14 : 21. So, the first term should also be 2 times 14 (the first term). Hence the proportional ratio is 28 : 42. For the second ratio, the first term is 6. What factor should we multiply 14 by to get 6? Can it be an integer? Or should it be a fraction? We can model this as 14y = 6. So, y = 6 14 = 3 7. So, we need to multiply 21 (the second term of 14 : 21) also by the same factor 3 7. 21 × 3 7 is 9. So, the ratio is 6 : 9. In the third ratio, the first term is 2. We can see that when we divide 14 (the first term of 14 : 21) by 7 (HCF of 14 and 21) we get 2. If we divide 21 also by 7, we get 3. So, the ratio is 2 : 3. Filter Coffee!

To solve such problems, we can model two proportional ratios using algebraic notation as — a : b :: c : d. For these two ratios to be proportional, we know that term c should be a multiple of term a by a factor, say f, and term d should be a multiple of term b by the same factor f. So, c = f a ...(1) d = f b ...(2) From (1) and (2), we can say that, f = c a and f = d b . Therefore, c a = d b. Multiplying both sides by ab, we get, ab × c a = ab × d b ab × c a = ab × d b bc = ad or ad = bc Thus, when a : b :: c : d, then ad = bc. This is known as cross multiplication of terms. Since ad = bc, we can show that d = bc a . Two ratios are proportional if their terms are equal when cross multiplied. The fourth unknown quantity can be found through such cross multiplication. In ancient India, Āryabhaṭa (199 CE) and others called such problems of proportionality Rule of Three problems. There were 3 numbers given — the pramāṇa (measure — ‘a’ in our case), the phala (fruit — ‘b’ in our case), and the ichchhā (requisition — ‘c’ in our case). To find the ichchhāphala (yield — ‘d’ in our case), Āryabhaṭa says, “Multiply the phala by the ichchhā and divide the resulting product by the pramāṇa.” In other words, Āryabhaṭa says, “pramāṇa : phala :: ichchhā : ichchhāphala,” therefore, pramāṇa × ichchhāphala = phala × ichchhā."}

Using the cross multiplication method proposed by Āryabhaṭa, ancient Indians solved complex problems that involved proportionality. Example 9: A car travels 90 km in 150 minutes. If it continues at the same speed, what distance will it cover in 4 hours? If it continues at the same speed, the ratio of the time taken should be proportional to the ratio of the distance covered. 150 : 90 :: 4 : ? Is this the right way to formulate the question? No, because 150 is in minutes, but 4 is in hours. The second ratio should use the same units for time as the first ratio. Since 4 hours is 240 minutes, the right form is 150 : 90 :: 240 : ? How can you find the distance covered in 240 minutes? Discuss with your classmates and find the answer using different strategies. We can model this proportion as 150 : 90 :: 240 : x. By cross multiplication, we get 150 × x = 240 × 90 Therefore, x = 240 × 90 150 . 48 3 = 240 × 90 150 = 144. 5 1 The distance covered by the car in 4 hours is 144 km. Example 10: A small farmer in Himachal Pradesh sells each 200 g packet of tea for ₹200. A large estate in Meghalaya sells each 1 kg packet of tea for ₹800. Are the weight-to-price ratios in both places proportional? Which tea is more expensive? Note to the Teacher: Instead of giving one ‘method’ to solve the problem of the distance, encourage students to reason out the answer through different strategies. They can use their understanding of equivalent fractions and equivalent ratios to find the answer."}

Is it 1 : 800? This would not be appropriate, because we considered the weight in grams in the case of Himachal. So, the weight to price ratio is 1000 : 800 in Meghalaya after we convert the weight to grams. To check if the ratios are proportional, we need to see if both ratios are the same in their simplest forms. The Himachal tea ratio in its simplest form is 1 : 1. The Meghalaya tea ratio in its simplest form is 5 : 4. So, the ratios are not proportional. Which tea is more expensive? Why? To answer the question as to which tea is more expensive, we should compare the price of tea for the same weight in both places. What is the price of 1 kg of tea from Meghalaya? It is ₹800. In Himachal, if 200 g of tea costs rupees 200, what is the cost of 1 kg of tea? Let us say that the price of 1 kg of tea is x rupees. 200 g is 1 5 of 1 kg. So, 1 5 × x = 200. Multiplying both sides by 5, we get 1 5 × x × 5 = 200 × 5 1 5 × x × 5 = 1000 x = 1000. So, the cost of 1 kg of tea is ₹800 in Meghalaya and ₹1,000 in Himachal Pradesh. Therefore, the tea from Himachal Pradesh is more expensive. Activity 1: Take your favourite dish. Find out all the ingredients and their respective quantities needed to make the dish for your family.

Your partner takes 3 counters and you take 1 counter. There are now 8 counters left. 2. Your partner takes 3 more counters and you take 1 more counter. There are now 4 counters left. 3. Your partner takes 3 more counters and you take 1 more counter. There are no more counters left. So, your partner gets 9 counters in total and you get 3 counters.

Now, if you want to share 42 counters between the two of you in the ratio of 4 : 3, how will you do it? Using the same procedure would take a long time!

We need to split x into groups such that it can be divided into two parts where the first part has m groups and the second part has n groups. 2. But what is the size of each group? This can be found out by dividing x by the number of groups. The number of groups are m + n. So, the size of each group is x m + n . 3. So, the first part has m × x m + n objects and the second part has n × x m + n objects. Thus, if we want to divide a quantity x in the ratio of m: n, then the parts will be m × x m + n and n × x m + n. We see that m × x m + n : n × x m + n :: m : n. Example 11: Prashanti and Bhuvan started a food cart business near their school. Prashanti invested ₹75,000 and Bhuvan invested ₹25,000. At the end of the first month, they gained a profit of ₹4,000. They decided that they would share the profit in the same ratio as that of their investment. What is each person’s share of the profit? The ratio of their investment is 75000 : 25000. Reducing this ratio to its simplest form, we get 3 : 1. 3 + 1 is 4 and dividing the profit of 4000 by 4, we get 1000.

But the new ratio of sand to cement is 5 : 2. So the question is, 5 : 2 :: 30 : ? If the ratio is 5 : 2, then the second term is 2 5 times the first term.

Having nurtured students’ inherent abilities, touching upon all the five planes of human existence, the pañchakośas in the Foundational and the Preparatory Stages have paved the way for the progression of their learning further at the Middle Stage. Thus, the Middle Stage acts as a bridge between the Preparatory and the Secondary Stages, spanning three years from Grade 6 to Grade 8. The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow as they advance in lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects in three languages—including at least two languages native to India— Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy—a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry.

Considering the focus on holistic well-being, NCF-SE has mandated Physical Education and Well-being as a core curricular area for all stages of school education. To help the teachers and students achieve curricular goals of Physical Education and Well-being, for the first time a textbook has been designed for Grade 8. This book enables students to experience the joy of playing, explore diverse physical activities, practice fitness skills, learn basic sports skills, and immerse in the world of yoga. Sports and physical activities teach important motor skills, socio-emotional awareness and regulation, associated cognitive abilities, as well as the values of self-discipline, hard work, teamwork, and a gracious acceptance of one’s strengths and vulnerabilities. To achieve the goals of fitness, sports and holistic well-being, the Grade 8 textbook is designed to have the following six units. 1. Foundations of Physical Education and Well-being 2. Physical and Motor Fitness 3. Fundamental Skills of Athletics 4. Fundamental Skills of Table Tennis 5. Fundamental Skills of Volleyball 6.

In Unit 2, students learn different fitness components like endurance, strength, flexibility, and balance. The main aim is to understand how each of these components contributes to overall health. Units 3, 4 and 5 focus on learning new games. Athletics is introduced in Unit 3, Table Tennis in Unit 4 and Volleyball in Unit 5. Through interactive sessions and group exercises, students will discover the excitement of sports and health advantages of physical activities. The emphasis will be on inclusivity, team cohesion, and enjoyment of movement. In the last unit, that is, Unit 6 students immerse in the holistic nature of yoga. They learn about Yama (social discipline) and Niyama (Personal discipline) to inculcate healthy habits for positive behavior. Systematic practice of various yogāsanas starting with Sūkṣhma Vyāyāma (loosening exercises), preparatory breathing practices and step-by-step performance of each āsana helps our body to be flexible, strong, balanced and disease free. Various techniques of Prāṇāyāma strengthen the lungs, improve functioning of major systems of our body, calm down the mind, improve concentration and help in achieving overall harmony and well-being. To explore the world within us and experience deep sense of peace, tranquility and bliss, students learn different techniques of Dhāraṇā (single pointed concentration) and Dhyāna (meditation). Learning various yogic practices lays the foundation for a long and healthy life.

Scenario 1: Three different types of sessions have been visualised to effectively use the limited time in each period and achieve the learning outcomes. • Type 1: Maximises game practice. • Type 2: Maximises circle time after play to provide sufficient time for discussing cognitive and socio-emotional aspects. • Type 3: Maximises gamified drills to focus on one specific skill. A sample time allocation for a 40-minute duration is given below for all types."}

Physical education teachers may assist in development characteristics like willpower, determination, resoluteness, self-discipline, team spirit, and awareness to succeed by observing how athletes behave throughout practice and competition. Running Running is a method of terrestrial locomotion by which humans and other animals move quickly on foot. Running is an aerial gait in which the feet are above the ground. Running is one of the most essential athletic skills, requiring proper technique, speed, endurance, and coordination. Techniques to Start the Race There are two types of starts: 1. Crouch start or Sitting start: This is used for all running events up to 400-metre. It allows the runner to react to the sound and start the race as fast as possible by properly positioning their centre of gravity in the ‘set’ position. In a short-distance race, the outcome is decided by a quick start and an increased acceleration capacity. Modern starting techniques use three different types of starting positions, which are outlined below: (a) Bunch or Bullet start (b) Medium start (c) Elongated start 2. Standing start: This type of start is commonly used in middle- distance and long-distance races. The athlete begins in an upright position, with one foot slightly ahead of the other, and starts running smoothly when the race begins. This start allows for better pacing and control over longer distances. In this Grade you will only learn about Crouch or Sitting Start."}

Set Position • At “set”, the runners raise their hips by lifting the knee of the rear leg off the ground. • The body weight is distributed almost evenly over the four supporting areas. • The head remains in a natural, relaxed position. • The ‘set’ position conveys to the runner’s body the preliminary tension necessary for a powerful start from the blocks. • In order to achieve a high initial speed, the angles of both legs are of particular importance. An angle of about 90° at the front knee and of about 110° to 130° at the rear knee is appropriate."}

Drive Phase • At “go”, the sprinter starts without any delay. • A quick response to the gun is of major importance for a fast start. • The power exerted on the blocks when starting will transmit the highest possible initial velocity to the runner’s body. • This is brought about by an explosive pushing of both legs against the blocks. • The main technical skills in the leg action are: – After coming off the rear starting block, the push-off leg starts to drive forward, that is, the thigh is rapidly drawn forward and upward. – The leading leg should remain in an approximately horizontal position. • Proper arm action: – The arms have an important function in helping to produce the starting acceleration. – Pay special attention to the action of the arms. – The movement of the swinging leg requires that the respective arm swings forward and upward. – The arm tends to bend increasingly at the elbow until it reaches an angle of about 90° in the final phase of the movement."}

Acceleration Phase • At the beginning of the acceleration phase, the runner has a marked forward body lean. • With an increasing rate and length of stride, the angle of inclination gradually decreases, so that after 20m the runner reaches the normal sprinting position. • The forward body lean should be at its maximum when the front foot comes off the starting block and during the initial strides. • A good body lean is a function of the power exerted by the push-off force during the first few strides. • The greater this force, the smaller the angle between the runner’s body and the ground. • Runners with a poor push-off force will come to an upright position sooner. • In some cases, runners with a good push-off force prematurely assume an upright position because they raise their heads immediately after the start in order to look up to the finish. Teachers should • Observe the speed of reaction to the gun and the sequence of movement. • Observe the speed and extension of the knee and hip joints. • Ensure that the athlete optimises the drive from the blocks. • Observe that the arms move quickly so that there is a coordinated leg balance."}

Teachers should • Observe the action of the limbs and position of the trunk and head. • Observe the increase in stride length and frequency. • Ensure that the runner’s transition into the sprinting action is smooth. 5.

{"id": "class 8__phe__p84__c1", "text": "70 Khel Yatra Jumping Jumping is an essential skill in athletics, defined as the act of propelling oneself into the air using one or both legs. It requires power, coordination, and technique. From a technical perspective, jumping events vary in complexity, ranging from the simple Long Jump to the High Jump and Triple Jump, with the Pole Vault appearing more intricate. The primary objective in these events is to achieve the greatest possible height or distance. In the Triple Jump, athletes aim to maximise the total distance of three successive jumps, while in the Pole Vault, they utilise a pole to assist in clearing greater heights. The key components of jumping are: 1. Approach run • A controlled run to generate momentum. • Athletes must maintain speed and balance before take- off. 2. Take-off • The athlete pushes off from the ground using one or both legs. • Proper body alignment is essential for maximising height and distance. 3. Flight phase • The body remains in motion after take-off. • Proper posture and leg movement are crucial to maintaining balance. 4. Landing • Athletes should land with bent knees to absorb impact. • Athletes should maintain a balanced position to avoid fouls."}

To generate a powerful and effective serve, it is important to use the whole body, applying both types of energy. Potential Energy is stored in the body when a player bends their knees, loads their arm, and prepares to serve. This energy builds up before the movement. Kinetic Energy is released when the player extends their legs, swings their arm, and makes contact with the ball, converting stored energy into motion for a strong serve. Spiking is also known as smash which can be done from any place of the court but smashing near the net helps more in scoring a point. Extremities refer to the limbs of the body. • Upper Extremities: These include the arms, from the shoulder to the hands. • Lower Extremities: These include the legs, from the hip to the toes.

It teaches us how to cultivate a natural balance among the body, mind and emotions. This inner harmony is inspired by nature’s perfect balance, just as it harmonises day and night or the changing seasons. The Bhagavad Gita defines yoga as “samatvam yoga uchyate (2.48)”, meaning “Yoga is a state of balance.” The key to achieving this state is to focus on the present moment, and enjoying what is happening right now rather than dwelling on the past or anticipating the future. This practice naturally reduces stress and brings freedom from desires. Furthermore, it helps us mindfully connect with the world while teaching us to be kind, compassionate, and understanding towards others’ feelings. Let us now turn our attention to the yoga practices that further deepen our connection to the present moment. Do you remember those amazing yoga poses we learnt in Grade 7, like the graceful Marjariāsana and the energising Sūrya Namaskāra? We explored the concept of Pancha Kośha to gain a deeper understanding of the different layers of the self. We even mastered some challenging poses like the Utakatāsana, Sarvāgāsana, Danurāsana, and the Matsyāsana. We also learnt to regulate our breath with Bhastrika Prāṇāyāma and discovered the benefits of Hasta Mudrā. Now, let us continue this fascinating journey by deepening our understanding, and learning a few more practices. In this grade, we will explore how yoga can support us, particularly as we navigate changes and learn to manage our emotions. We will explore Yama and Niyama and learn how to apply them in our daily lives. We will also learn Sūkṣhma Vyāyāma, Sthula Vyāyāma, Sūrya Namaskāra, āsana"}

Over time, various masters documented their techniques and experiences in ancient yoga texts. These texts are more than just books; they are treasure chests holding the profound wisdom of yoga masters. This wisdom passed down through generations, illuminates the path of yoga, offering guidance on ethical living, physical postures, breath regulation, and mental discipline. Some of the most important yoga texts are as follows: • Patañjali Yoga Sutra: Maharishi Patañjali’s Yoga Sutra is the initial systematic text of yoga sādhana. It has four pāda (chapters), and contains 195 short, concise, and powerful statements that guide us on the path of yoga. These sutras teach us various important concepts, such as Ashtānga Yoga. • Haṭha Pradīpikā: This text discusses the practical aspects of yoga and is divided into 4 chapters. Swami Svātmārāma is the author of this text. It explains how to practise āsanas, Ṣhaṭkarma (six cleansing techniques), Prāṇāyāma, mudrā, Bandha (neuromuscular or energy locks—muscle contractions that facilitate energy flow) and Samādhi. • Gheranḍa Samhitā: The Gheranḍa Samhitā, written by Rishi Gheranḍa, is a practical guide to yoga comprising seven chapters. It teaches Saptānga Yoga, a step-by-step method that begins with body exercises and leads to inner understanding. It talks about Ṣhaṭkarma, āsana, mudrā, Pratyāhāra, Prāṇāyāma, Dhyāna and Samādhi.

Yamas are universal guidelines for being good that everyone, everywhere, at any time, should try to follow, regardless of their religion or region. Yama’s principles help us become good citizens who care for others. Patañjali's Yoga Sutras explain these disciplines as follows: अहिंसासत््ययायास््ततेतेयब्रह्मचर््यापरिग्रहा यमाः ॥ २.३० ॥ Ahimsāsatyāsteyabrahmacharyāparigrahā Yamah || 2.30 || Yama consists of five principles: Ahimsā (non-violence), Satya (truthfulness), Asteya (non-stealing), Brahmacharya (moderation), and Aparigraha (non-possessiveness). By practising these Yamas, we can create a peaceful and harmonious society where everyone feels valued and respected. Activity 3 Activity 4 Understanding the Yamas 1.

Notes for the teacher • Encourage students to relate the yamas to their experiences. • Facilitate a class discussion following the activity, allowing students to share their answers and perspectives. • Emphasise that even small actions can make a difference. Now, let us explore yogic concepts for cultivating ourselves into better individuals. Niyama Through Yamas, we learn to interact with the world in a kind and honest manner. Niyamas help us focus on our inner self. Maharishi Patañjali provides us with five Niyamas, personal guidelines that help us lead a joyful and fulfilling life. The five Niyamas are Śhaucha (cleanliness), Santoṣha (contentment), Tapas (self-discipline), Svādhyāya (self-study), and Īśhvara Praṇidhāna (surrender to the divine). Niyama teaches us to look within, rather than focusing solely on what is happening around us. शौचसन््ततोतोषतपःस््ववावाध््ययायायेश्वरप्रणिधानानि नियमाः ॥ २.३२॥ śhauchasantoṣhatapahsvādhyāyeśvarapraṇidhānāni niyamah || 2.32 || 1. Śhaucha (Cleanliness): Śhaucha means physical and mental purity. We can practise it by keeping the body clean, eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly. For mental purity, we can chant the mantras (japa), perform selfless service, and cultivate cheerfulness and compassion for others."}
{"id": "class 8__phe__p190__c1", "text": "176 Khel Yatra 2. Santoṣha (Contentment): Santoṣha means finding joy and peace. It teaches us that true happiness is not just about having more things, but instead, it is about appreciating what you already have in your life. When we practice Santoṣha, we feel calm and at ease. We can also cultivate a deeper sense of contentment by appreciating the good in others, being kind to everyone, finding joy in giving, and learning to forgive. This does not mean we ignore our potential to grow, instead, it is about truly enjoying what we have, even with its limitations, much like a child who finds pure happiness in small, simple things. 3. Tapas (Self-discipline): Tapas means self-discipline, dedication, and determination. Cultivating tapas empowers us with the inner strength to pursue our goals and navigate life’s challenges diligently. It is the willpower that enables us to remain disciplined in our actions, stay consistent in our efforts, and even willingly set aside immediate comforts for the sake of achieving a larger objective. 4. Svādhyāya (Self-study): Svādhyāya means self-study, which helps us develop self-discipline. We can understand ourselves better through activities like reading, meditation, and self-reflection. Even when we do any task with focus and effort, we learn more about ourselves.

Activity 5 Let us understand and apply the five Niyamas in our daily lives. For each Niyamas explain how it helps you live a better life by using the questions below as a guide. 1. Choose just one of the five Niyamas that you want to focus on for a short while. 2. Instead of a big goal, think of one small, simple wish related to that Niyama. If you choose ‘being more organised’, your small wish could be ‘I want to feel happy with whatever I already have.’ 3. How will you know if you are making your small wish come true? 4. Is your small wish something you can really do? 5. Why would making this small wish come true be a good thing for you? 6. How long do you hope to make this small wish happen? Śhaucha: Physical and mental purity Let us learn more about Śhaucha. Śhaucha refers not only to the physical cleanliness of the body but also to the mental purity of the mind. To maintain mental purity or health, let us explore and understand the Ariṣaḍvargas, which are like enemies of the mind. The Ariṣhaḍvargas are six negative forces that can disturb our minds. They are: Ariṣhaḍvargas (Six major enemies of the mind) Desire (Kāma) Anger (Krodha) Greed (Lobha) Attachment (Moha) Arrogance (Mada) Jealousy (Matsarya) Think of your mind as a calm, clear pond. Śhaucha means keeping this mental pond clean and free from any dirt. When the pond is clear, you can see everything within it beautifully. But if it gets dirty, everything becomes blurry and hard to see."}

The story of Anjali and the clear pond Anjali, a young teenager, often found solace in observing the village pond. Its usual state of pristine clarity, mirroring the expansive sky, evoked a sense of tranquillity and joy within her. The pond’s transparency allowed her to witness the vibrant life beneath the surface, where she observed the fish in their natural habitat. However, the pond’s condition was not always peaceful. Following turbulent weather or instances of pollution, the water would become murky and disturbed. This transformation saddened Anjali, as the loss of the clear reflection obscured the pond’s beauty, concealed its inhabitants, and created an overall sense of disorder. One day, Anjali’s grandmother used the pond as an example to explain the nature of the human mind. She explained that when our thoughts are pure and untainted— Śhaucha— we"}

We can perceive situations and emotions with accuracy and achieve inner peace. However, negative emotions, such as envy, anger, greed, attachment, and sadness, act like pollutants, clouding our minds and distorting our perceptions. Anjali understood the analogy and began to apply the principle of purity, or Śhaucha, to her mental state. When she experienced feelings of superiority or a desire to be the best, she reminded herself of the unique strengths and talents inherent in every individual. When confronted with anger towards her brother, she practised mindful breathing and sought to understand his perspective. She discovered that by maintaining a clear and uncluttered mind, she was able to experience greater peace, improved focus, and healthier relationships. She recognised that cultivating inner purity was essential for a fulfilling and balanced life."}

In the clear thought bubble write down the clear thought or the way you want to deal with the messy thoughts in simple words.

Draw lines connecting each ‘messy thought’ bubble to a ‘clear thought’ bubble that could help deal with it. 4. If your mind feels like a garden with messy weeds, what is one small thing you can do today to start taking care of it? Just as Anjali learned to keep her mental pond clear, the Yama and Niyama principles guide us in living a clean and pure life, both in our actions and thoughts.

This steady, long-term practice in yoga is known as Abhyasa. Abhyasa means practising regularly without giving up or getting distracted and doing so with respect. By engaging in Abhyasa, we can develop the right mindset and a strong foundation for our yoga journey. When yoga is practised consistently, it enables us to apply the right kind of effort, focus, and energy and work efficiently towards achieving our goals. This mindset can help us succeed in various areas of life, such as studies, art, sports, and more.

This year, we will learn new āsana to enhance stability, balance, and flexibility. We will also focus on how to perform these āsanas with ease and effortlessness. Yoga is known for its many practices, but āsanas is the most popular. Some people even think that practising āsanas is all that yoga is about! there is to yoga! Long ago, spiritual seekers"}
{"id": "class 8__phe__p208__c1", "text": "194 Khel Yatra used āsanas mainly to prepare us for meditation. Today, we understand that āsanas can also help us manage the challenges of daily life. In the Yoga Sutras, Maharishi Patañjali described āsana as a means to cultivate a positive mindset. However, it is important to remember that āsanas are more than just physical exercises. They should be practised carefully and slowly, with full attention and awareness of the breath. Āsanas teach us how to care for and maintain our physical bodies. When we practise them, we use them as a foundation to turn our attention inward. As the Yoga Sutrā of Patañjali describes— स््थथिरसुखमम् आसनमम् । Sthirasukham āsanam । (2.46) That is, the posture should be steady and comfortable. This is key to performing āsanas. It means that we should aim for physical and mental stability and comfort in any posture. Sthira means ‘steady’, so holding the posture steadily is important. When you first start practising, it may feel challenging and even a little uncomfortable. However, do not worry! With regular practise, the āsana will become easier and more comfortable to do. Āsanas are often categorised into various groups to help us understand and practice them better; these include meditative, cultural, relaxing, and balancing poses. Before learning new āsanas, we must reinforce our understanding and practice of the ones we explored in the previous grades. These postures, which include poses like Ardhakati chakrāsana, Padmāsana, Bhujangāsana, Śhalabhāsana, Utkaṭāsana, Sarvāngāsana and Matsyāsana, are beneficial for building strength, flexibility, and balance. By revisiting these āsanas, we reinforce our understanding of their correct techniques and prepare our bodies for the more challenging āsanas that we will learn in this Grade."}

For safe and effective āsana practice, remember the following guidelines: • Always begin with warm-up exercises, such as Sūkṣhma Vyāyāma to prepare your body. Practise on an empty stomach, preferably in the morning. Breathe naturally through your nose with slow, deep breaths, and wear comfortable, loose clothing. • Avoid strain and overstretching; listen to your body’s signals. Focus on proper alignment and maintain a calm mind during practice. Conclude with a relaxation posture, such as Śhavāsana, and strive for consistent, daily practice for optimal benefits. For additional guidelines, please refer to the Grade 7 textbook. Vīrabhadrāsana (Warrior Pose) – Variation II Vīrabhadrāsana, also known as the Warrior Pose, is named after the mighty warrior Vīrabhadrā (Vīra meaning ‘warrior’, Bhadra meaning ‘best’).

Gently close your eyes and relax. Take a few slow, deep breaths in and out. Remember to breathe calmly. Let us begin by focusing gently on the right foot. Feel the right foot relaxing as you keep the attention there for a moment. Now, slowly shift your focus up to the right knee, right thigh, and finally to the right hip. Be aware of the entire right leg and feel it relaxing. 2. Now, gently shift the focus to the left foot. Feel it relaxing as you hold the attention there for a moment. Slowly move the focus up to the left knee, the left thigh, and finally, the left hip. Become aware of the entire left leg, allowing it to relax completely. 3. Now, bring the attention to the lower body— your pelvis (lower limbs), stomach, navel, and chest. 4. Bring attention to the right shoulder, right arm, palm, and fingers. Do the same for the left shoulder and left arm, palm and fingers. Next, focus on the throat, face, and the very top of the head. 5. While in this relaxed state, take a deep breath in. Notice how the body feels, and relax and enjoy this peaceful stillness for a few minutes. 6. Now, slowly become aware of the body and the space around you. Gently roll onto the right side and stay there for a few more minutes. 7. When you are ready, slowly sit up. Take the time, and when you feel comfortable, gently and gradually open your eyes. You can then rub the palms together to create warmth and gently cup them over the eyes."}

Kriyās Kriyās are special yoga techniques designed to purify the body from the inside out. While we all practice some form of cleansing daily, like bathing or brushing our teeth, yoga kriyās go deeper, targeting the internal organs. Over time, yogis have developed many kriyās, but six major ones, called the Ṣhhaṭa Kriyās, are considered the most important and comprehensive. They are: 1. Neti – Cleaning the nostrils 2. Dhouti – Cleaning the digestive tract 3. Bastī – Cleaning the bowels. 4. Naulī – Rolling the abdominal muscles 5. Trāṭaka – Gazing at one point 6.

In the Haṭha Yoga texts, it is classified under the Ṣhaṭ Kriyās. This practice involves active, rapid exhalation, while inhalation is a passive process. Practise guidelines • While practising Kapālabhāti, keep the body relaxed. • Never force the breath during the practice; start with 10 to 15 exhalations. • Practise this on an empty stomach. • Try to maintain a steady rhythm throughout the practice. • Girls should avoid this practice during menstruation. Step by step guide for the practice • Sit in a comfortable posture, such as Vajrāsana or Sukhāsana, with the spine erect, face relaxed, and eyes gently closed. • Adopt Chin Mudrā. • Inhale once, then exhale rapidly, like a blacksmith’s bellows, drawing the abdominal muscles inward as the air is expelled through the nostrils. • This practice can be performed for 10 to 20 exhalations, depending on one’s capacity. • When the practice is stopped, the breath halts automatically.

Pratyāhāra Pratyāhāra, is the fifth limb of Ashtānga Yoga, which teaches us to focus our minds by gently drawing our attention away from distractions. It is like turning down the noise of the outside world to better hear what’s happening within us. Pratyāhāra is a practice that helps to calm our mind by training our five senses (sight, hearing, taste, touch, and smell) to draw nourishment from within, rather than just from the outside world. The word Pratyāhāra comes from Sanskrit– Prati means ‘away from’, and āhāra means ‘nourishment.’ Thus, Pratyāhāra refers to withdrawing the senses from external stimuli. Think of it like a tortoise drawing its limbs into its shell for protection; in the same way, Pratyāhāra teaches us to withdraw our senses from distractions gently. By practising Indriya Pratyāhāra—the control of the senses— we learn to turn our attention inward. When you want to concentrate, try gently pulling your awareness away from what you see, hear, taste, touch and smell. With regular practice, your ability to focus will strengthen, as if placing a ‘Do Not Disturb’ sign on your mind to preserve your concentration."}

Imagine your eyes are closed—even if they are open—and focus only on the darkness behind your eyelids. • Hearing: Try not to pay attention to the sounds around you. Instead, listen only to your quiet thoughts. • Smell: Gently ignore any smells in the air. Notice the air as it comes in and out of your nose. • Taste: Be aware of the taste in your mouth, but do not try to change or focus on it too much. Just let it be. • Touch: Notice how your body is sitting or resting. Observe the sensations, but do not get too involved in them. Just be aware. Take a few slow, deep breaths while your ‘senses are inside your shell.’ Notice how your mind feels a little quieter and more still.

Think about how it felt to pull your attention inward gently. Did it help you feel more focused or calmer? This simple practice is a little taste of Pratyāhāra, learning to create your own ‘inner shell’ to protect your focus. You can try this anytime you need to concentrate. This skill can also be helpful in many situations, like studying, paying attention in class, or dealing with overwhelming feelings. DhāraṆa, Dhyāna and Samādhi Notes for the teacher • Read the activity beforehand to familiarise the students with the steps and the intended experience. • You may choose to play soft, calming background music. • Briefly discuss how focusing inward can enhance students' learning and understanding. • Encourage students to share their experiences. Dhāraṇa, Dhyāna and Samādhi are limbs of Ashtānga Yoga that help calm and still the mind. These practices are about learning to control the mind and improve focus. In them, the mind becomes the most important tool. Understanding how our mind works is the key to being healthy and happy— these three practices support this understanding. They lead to a state where we can control our thoughts, gain wisdom, and experience deep peace and joy. Essentially, they involve training the mind to concentrate on one specific object. Focus means keeping your attention on a single point. It has two main aspects— first, it involves keeping the mind within a specific boundary, not allowing it to wander. Second, even when many things try to distract you, focus is about actively choosing to stay with that one thing. Focusing takes effort, and the more distractions there are, the harder it becomes."}
{"id": "class 8__phe__p237__c1", "text": "223 Yoga What is Dhāraṇa? This ‘spot’ for meditation could be a thought, an object, or a sound (like a mantra). Fixing the mind on one of these is called Dhāraṇa. Dhāraṇa means ‘holding’ or ‘absorbing’ focus and is about concentrating on a specific area or object. It is not about focusing on a tiny point but rather about keeping the mind within a specific boundary. You can focus on many things, depending on your intention. For example, some ancient teachings suggest focusing on the navel to understand the human body or on the throat to control hunger and thirst. You might also focus on a statue, the story of a wise person, or even the breath. Practising Dhāraṇa helps us become more aware of ourselves and less ignorant. It makes the mind more stable and less prone to wandering, bringing peace and emotional balance. In this grade, let us learn the art of focusing through the practice of Jyoti Trāṭaka. Our eyes are amazing organs that allow us to see the world around us. However, with its stresses and increased screen time, modern life can negatively affect our vision. Yoga offers a practice called Trāṭaka, which may help reduce stress and improve specific eye problems. Trāṭaka means ‘steady gazing’ or ‘concentrated viewing.’ It is a practice where you focus on an object or a symbol. In Jyoti Trāṭaka, we use the light or flame of a lamp as the point of focus, and preparatory exercises are performed before practising it. Let us now follow a step-by-step preparatory practice for Jyoti Trāṭaka."}

When it comes to managing emotions during this time of change, it's very important to remember that if you're experiencing emotional turbulence, reaching out is key. Talking about your feelings and sharing them with a trusted elder, teacher, or counsellor is much healthier than keeping them bottled up or isolating yourself.

{"id": "class 8__science__p3__c1", "text": "The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 envisages a system of education in the country that is rooted in an Indian ethos and its civilisational accomplishments in all fields of knowledge and human endeavour. At the same time, it aims to prepare students to engage constructively with the opportunities and challenges of the twenty-first century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. By nurturing students’ inherent abilities across all five planes of human existence (pañchakośhas), the Foundational and Preparatory Stages set the Stage for further learning at the Middle Stage. Spanning Grades 6 to 8, the Middle Stage serves as a critical three-year bridge between the Preparatory and Secondary Stages. The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It strives to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages—including at least two languages native to India—to Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas, as these textbooks are intended to play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy—a role that helps strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. The Curiosity, textbook of science for Grade 8 is designed to make learning fun, engaging, and meaningful. Aligned with the NEP 2020 and the NCF-SE 2023, the textbook promotes experiential and inquiry-based learning. It encourages students to ask questions, think critically, Foreword"}

Integrating physics, chemistry, biology, and earth science, the textbook also highlights environmental awareness, ethical values, and insights from India’s rich tradition of knowledge. Featuring numerous hands-on activities and relatable examples, the book aims to simplify complex topics and foster deeper understanding. Collaborative learning is encouraged through group work and peer discussions, helping learners develop creativity, logical thinking, and decision-making skills. Rather than simply reading about science, students are guided to explore, question, and experience it actively—making the learning process both enjoyable and impactful. However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook, and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years. \b Dinesh Prasad Saklani Director New Delhi\b National Council of Educational June 2025\b Research and Training"}
{"id": "class 8__science__p5__c1", "text": "After exploring the Curiosity, Grade 7 textbook, we hope you discovered new ideas and found yourself wondering even more about the world around you! Our journey of exploration continues in Curiosity for Grade 8, where you will learn to ask deeper questions, design investigations, and think like real scientists. The Grade 8 textbook of science has been developed in alignment with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023. It is expected that all competencies outlined for the final year of Middle Stage (Grade 8) are achieved. This textbook is designed to help you learn about important topics, such as matter, the physical and living world, health, hygiene, and the connection between science, technology, and society. It also helps you understand how science works and how scientists think and explore. The main aim of Curiosity is to help you become a responsible and thoughtful member of society. The textbook integrates topics from biology, chemistry, physics, and earth science. It also incorporates essential themes, such as environmental care, value education, inclusivity, health, hygiene, and India’s traditional knowledge systems. The goal is to help you learn through real experiences rather than by simply memorising facts. Curiosity, the textbook of science for Grade 8, contains 13 chapters. Each chapter includes engaging activities, thought-provoking questions, and clear illustrations to support your learning. The first chapter is titled Exploring the Investigative World of Science. It gives you a quick look at the various topics you will come across in this book and is designed to get you more excited about science! This chapter takes you to the next step — entering the investigative world of science, where curiosity, wonder, and discovery come together. You will learn to ask focused questions, design and try out simple experiments to help answer them, and use your observation, exploration, and investigation skills to understand how things work. This chapter is meant to be a fun and friendly introduction to your science journey. Each chapter begins with a picture linked to the chapter that is designed to spark curiosity, capture your attention, and connect prior knowledge to new concepts. There are a few Probe and ponder questions. These are critical thinking questions that are not for evaluation and do not always have simple answers. Instead, they make you think more deeply and explore new ideas. Some of these About this Book Probe and ponder Dear Young Scientists,"}

A step further boxes contain advanced concepts that explore the topic in more depth. The information given in these boxes also brings scientific principles and knowledge into real-life questions are open-ended and thought-provoking because they do not just ask for a fact or a quick answer. Instead, they ask why or how, encouraging you to think critically and stay curious. You may not always be able to find the answers to these questions even after going through the chapter, but do not worry. They will help you link different concepts and deepen your curiosity, and perhaps help you understand the process of science. Many of these questions will also be explored further in higher grades. In fact, we are sure you may also have such questions, and there is space to add your own! The activities in the book are designed to reflect how science works, offering both hands-on and minds-on experiences. These activities promote teamwork and are inclusive in nature, ensuring participation from all students. Teachers are expected to pay extra attention while supporting children with special needs, especially during experiments involving light, heating devices, microscopes, etc. Teachers should assist these students in visualising the experimental setup. Additionally, they may encourage peer interactions to help students understand concepts of science better. The text also includes questions to help students assess their understanding and reflect how much they have learnt. Many of these questions are aimed at encouraging students to think deeply, reflect on their own ideas, and analyse concepts critically.

{"id": "class 8__science__p22__c1", "text": "2 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 Our journey with Curiosity, into the world of science continues in Grade 8. We hope you bring along the spirit of adventure and exploration that has guided us so far. In Grade 6, we discovered how science begins with wonder, with simple “Why?” and “How?” questions about the world around us. In Grade 7, we learnt that science is always evolving — that each answer opens new questions, and how our ideas can slowly change as we explore deeper. Now, in Grade 8, we take the next step: entering the Investigative World of Science, where wonder and evolution come together to form the heart of how science works. We don’t want you to just learn new facts, we want you to learn how to find new facts. Investigation in science means more than just looking at something and asking only simple questions. Now you can ask more focused questions, and design ways to perhaps do simple experiments to answer those questions, and then use your observations to improve your understanding. Step by step, we will learn how to use questions as starting points to try to observe carefully, experiment thoughtfully, and explain clearly what we see. In doing so, each of you won’t just be learners but also investigators, young scientists, exploring real-world puzzles. These may range from everyday life — like why does dough rise? — to the bigger mysteries of Earth and beyond like is the world getting warmer? As you turn each page of this book, we hope you notice the interesting design of our page numbers once again. On the left-hand pages, at the bottom, you’ll find the image of a root, symbolising the deep, solid foundation of knowledge that keeps us connected to our environment, traditions, and our cultural and natural heritage. On the right-hand pages, in the top corner, you’ll find a kite soaring in the sky, reminding us that curiosity must take flight if we are to explore the unknown. Together, these two symbols — the root and the kite — invite you to stay grounded in real observations, while allowing your ideas to soar towards new horizons. Remember, investigation in science works best only when we balance the solid ground of careful observation with the freedom of creative thinking. You will also notice some patterns in the lines at the bottom of the page. There are some hidden scientific thoughts in these as well. But don’t worry, they are mainly to make the page a little less boring. Let us now take a brief look at the various stops on our journey this year, and see where our curiosity, supported by strong roots and lifted by soaring ideas, might take us!"}
{"id": "class 8__science__p23__c1", "text": "Chapter 1 — Exploring the Investigative World of Science 3 This year, our investigative adventure will take us on a journey from the tiny microbes we can’t see to planet-wide challenges we can’t ignore. We will start by examining something as small as a single drop of water, and uncover a hidden world of tiny organisms, unseen but deeply linked to us. Some of these are invisible helpers, that help us digest our food or produce medicines, while others can be harmful, causing infections. But what does our body need to stay healthy? How do we fight these infections? We’ll find out how nutritious food, exercise, medicines, and vaccines help us stay healthy and fight infections. But that’s just the beginning. In today’s world, science does play a major role in improving our lives. For example, we use electric current in many ways to help make our lives easier. We depend on the heating effect of electric current to keep us warm, while the magnetic effect helps motors run and machines function. These phenomena depend on fundamental forces. So after watching electricity do work, we move on to study these forces themselves, starting with those that make objects speed up, slow down, or change direction. Understanding forces helps explain why a ball thrown up in the air falls back to the ground, or why a car stops when the brakes are applied. This also leads us to the idea of pressure — how the force is distributed over an object. The same concepts of force and pressure also decide how air moves. A small difference in pressure can result in a gentle breeze while a stronger pressure difference can lead to strong winds, and sometimes even cyclones."}
{"id": "class 8__science__p24__c1", "text": "4 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 So, these forces are connected to powerful weather events—like storms and cyclones—that affect our daily lives, agriculture, and even our safety. To truly understand how air can exert pressure or why water boils at a certain temperature we need to zoom into these materials and see what kind of particles they are made up of, and how they move around. Everything around us is made of tiny particles. In materials that are solid these particles cannot move much, while in gases they can move around freely. Classifying things around us is an important feature of science. We can also classify materials around us into elements (pure substances), compounds (two or more elements bonded together), and mixtures (combinations that can be separated physically). Once we know how particles combine or mix, we can then understand solutions — for example, how sugar dissolves in tea to make it sweet. From the world of particles and mixtures, we then move into the world of light. We’ll study how light rays reflect off flat and curved mirrors, and bends when passing through lenses and helps us understand the working of many objects around us. The bending of light explains what happens when we see an image in a shiny metal spoon or how corrective glasses help many of us see clearly. It’s not just a polished mirror that reflects light, rough surfaces reflect light as well, and so does the Moon. Depending on the relative positions of the Earth, Moon and Sun, a slightly different part of the Moon is illuminated each night, giving rise to the beautiful phases of the Moon that we see in the sky. Watching the periodic cycles of the Moon’s phases allowed humans to come up with the first calendars. By combining careful observations of sunrises, sunsets, and lunar cycles, various calendars came into being. Isn’t it fascinating that the calendars which determine our routines on Earth are linked to the motions of objects far beyond our planet?"}
{"id": "class 8__science__p25__c1", "text": "Chapter 1 — Exploring the Investigative World of Science 5 But it’s not just calendars or the movements of the Sun and Moon that are linked. Right here on Earth, there are marvellous and complex patterns of relationships between living organisms and their environments. Every living being — from tiniest insect to the largest whale, from blades of grasses to tall trees — depends on and responds to the air, water, sunlight, and other organisms around them forming the ecosystems that support life on our planet. In the final chapter of this book, we can put it all together and try to understand what makes Earth ‘just right’ for life and to recognise the urgent challenges that our planet now faces. Most importantly, the Earth lies at the perfect distance from the Sun, where water remains liquid, and it has an atmosphere that provides the oxygen we breathe while shielding us from harmful ultraviolet rays. But human activities on the planet can cause small changes in the temperature of the Earth, disrupting climate patterns, with dangerous consequences.

The challenges ahead won’t always be easy. We hope some of you will try to solve these difficult problems with Curiosity as your guide."}
{"id": "class 8__science__p26__c1", "text": "6 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 To help you think like a scientist, let us go back to a question we asked on the first page: Why is one side of a puri thinner than the other? Firstly, remember that science is everywhere! You don’t need a fancy laboratory to do simple experiments. Even your kitchen at home is a wonderful place to observe and ask questions. All you need is to start with curiosity, careful observation, and asking what happens if…? Have you noticed how a puri or a batura puffs up when placed in hot oil? Or how a phulka swells when put directly on the flame. Why does it puff up like a balloon? And why is one side thinner than the other? These are questions a scientist might ask — and you can too! Let’s see how we can investigate this simple everyday phenomenon like a scientist would. First, we will try to ask a scientific question. What are the different things that may change the way a puri puffs up when fried? To answer this, we may want to do some simple experiments. For that, we try and find out two main things — what all can we change or control when we do the experiment, and what all can we observe to see if these changes made any difference. In this case, we can perhaps think of the changing the thickness and the size of the rolled dough. We could also try to use different types of flour (atta, maida, etc.). While frying the puri, we can also change the temperature of the hot oil, or try and drop the rolled dough into the oil in different ways (drop it vertically? slide it at an angle? slide it slowly?) Notice that these are things that we can control. However, to make sense of the changes, we also need to think of what we can observe or measure. Some of these may have just yes/no answers, in some cases there might be a number we can measure. Maybe we can start by checking whether the puri puffs up (yes/no), or we can measure the time it takes to puff up (seconds). We can check whether a very thick layer of dough still gives a thin side to the puri. Further, while doing such experiments, it is better to change only one thing at a time while keeping the other conditions same. For example, if we wanted to see the effect of boiling hot, hot, and not very hot oil, we would"}
{"id": "class 8__science__p27__c1", "text": "Chapter 1 — Exploring the Investigative World of Science 7 use circles of dough of the same thickness, and drop them in the same way. It is also a good idea to keep notes of everything that you see and sense when doing an experiment. Did the oil splatter, smell, or smoke? And after doing one round of experiments, you may think of more questions. Do puris puff better when made fresh or from stored dough? What happens if I prick a hole in the puri before frying? This is exactly how all scientific experiments, from simple to the most complicated are done. This is the idea of systematic investigation. And just so you know, even this simple everyday observation — of a puri swelling — is not really completely understood by scientists today! So, whether it is the swelling of a puri or the shrinking bright part of the Moon after purnima, let your careful observations guide you along your explorations into the investigate world of science. Happy investigating!"}

For a long time, many tiny things around us remained unknown. Long ago, people discovered that a curved piece of glass could make small things look bigger. The piece of glass was shaped like a lentil seed — thick in the middle and thin at the edge — hence they called it a lens. Over time, lenses were improved to become more powerful. Each new tool, from simple magnifying glasses to microscopes, helped humans see what their eyes could not. The invention of the microscope opened a fascinating hidden world filled with tiny living creatures. We will explore some of these life forms in this chapter. You have already learnt about the amazing variety of living beings. Just look around — there are so many beautiful plants and animals! They are of all shapes, sizes, and colours. Some living beings are tiny, while others are really big. They differ not only in their structure but also in many other features. All these living beings, whether plants or animals, are called organisms. Have you ever noticed the smallest organism around you that is visible to the naked eye? Think about it — how small a thing can your eyes actually see? You might have seen some people using reading glasses. How does it help them see better?

Now, use a real magnifying glass to look at small organisms, like an ant. Were you able to see the details of its body more clearly? For a long time, people were curious to explore the tiny organisms around them, but they could not see them with their naked eyes. So, how did we finally discover this invisible world?

{"id": "class 8__science__p30__c1", "text": "10 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 Ever heard of ... In 1665, a scientist named Robert Hooke published a book called Micrographia. He was a careful observer, and a skilled artist. In this book, he showed detailed drawings of tiny things that people had never seen before — things he saw using a tool we now call a microscope. His microscope made things look 200 to 300 times bigger, than what one could see with the unaided eye. One day, he looked at a thin slice of cork and saw it was made of many small, empty spaces. These compartments reminded him of a honeycomb. He drew what he saw and called each small space a cell. This was the first time the word cell was used in science to describe the basic unit of life. Around the same time in 1660s, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch scientist, made better lenses that allowed him to build more useful microscopes. He was the first person to clearly see and describe tiny living things like bacteria and blood cells. Because of this, he is known as the Father of Microbiology.

This layer is called the onion peel. z Place the peel in a petri dish containing a few drops of safranin (red-coloured stain) for 30 seconds.

What did you observe? You will observe a polygon- shaped structure as shown in Fig. 2.4. These are cheek cells, which form the inner lining of your mouth. What similarities and differences did you observe between the cells of onion peel in Activity 2.2 and human cheek cells in Activity 2.3? You have observed that cells have three main parts — a thin outer lining, a central region, and a small round structure inside it. The outer layer is called the cell membrane. The round structure in the middle is the nucleus, which is also covered by a thin membrane. The space between the cell membrane and nucleus is filled with cytoplasm. These three — cell membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus — are the basic parts of a cell. Some cells, like onion peel cells, have an extra outer layer called the cell wall. What is the importance of these structures in a cell? What functions do they perform? Are these functions important for the maintenance of life? The cell membrane encloses the cytoplasm and nucleus. The cell membrane separates one cell from another. It is porous and allows the entry of materials essential for life processes and the exit of waste material. Cytoplasm contains other components of the cell and compounds, such as carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and mineral salts. Most of the life processes take place within the cytoplasm.

{"id": "class 8__science__p33__c1", "text": "Chapter 2 — The Invisible Living World: Beyond Our Naked Eye 13 The nucleus regulates all activities that occur within the cell. It also regulates growth. The cell wall in the plant cell provides rigidity and strength to plants. This is why all cells are arranged compactly with each other and look firm in structure. A step further Cells in all parts of a plant have tiny rod-shaped structures called plastids. Some plastids, like chloroplasts, contain chlorophyll, which makes them green and helps in photosynthesis. In non-green parts, they help in the storage of substances. Plant cells also have a large, empty-looking space called a vacuole. This helps the plant cell store important substances, get rid of waste, and maintain the shape of the cell. This gives strength and support to the plant. In animal cells, vacuoles are usually not present, if present, they are usually small. These small vacuoles store certain substances dissolved in water (Fig. 2.5). So, a cell is not just a simple bag of liquid — it is a complex structure made up of many different parts, each with its own special function to allow the cell, and in turn the entire organism to work.

(The colours are to show different parts of the cell) We have now understood the basic structure of cell. And we now also understand that plant and animal cells differ in shape and structure. Do different animal cells also vary in their shape and structure? 2.1.1 Variation in shape and structure of cells The muscle cell and the nerve cell of a human are shown in Fig. 2.6a and (b). What are the similarities and differences you see in them? A muscle cell (Fig. 2.6a) is shaped like a spindle, while a nerve cell (Fig. 2.6b) is very long and has branches. Similarly, some cells are round in shape, while others are long and thin. The number of cells also varies in different organisms. Why do cells look so different from each other? Does the shape and structure of a cell relate to its function? (a) Muscle cell (b) Nerve cell Fig. 2.6: Different cells in humans"}
{"id": "class 8__science__p34__c1", "text": "14 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 The unique shape, size, and structure of cells help them carry out their specific functions. But how do these cells help in performing various functions in the body? Let us find out. You observed in Activity 2.3 that inner cheek cells are thin and flat. They form a protective lining on the inner surface of the cheek. Nerve cells also known as neurons carry messages in our body. The elongated shape and branched structure help them reach different parts of the body and pass on messages quickly. Similarly, plant cells also show variation. In plants, too, cells may be rectangular, elongated, oval, or even tube-like. Some plant cells form long tubes that help carry water throughout the plant. You have already studied the digestive system in Grade 7. Different parts of the digestive system are made up of different types of cells. A group of muscle cells are present in the food pipe. These cells contract and relax in a wave-like manner, pushing the food down to the stomach. This movement is possible because muscle cells are thin, flexible, and spindle-shaped. The stomach also has different types of cells for performing different functions. Muscle cells in the stomach wall help churn the food. Other cells in the inner lining of the stomach produce digestive juices and acid that help break down the food. All these cells work together to make digestion possible. 2.2 What Are the Levels of Organisation in the Body of a Living Organism? The body of a living organism is organised in a complex way. Cell (Fig. 2.7a), is the basic unit of life, just like a brick is the basic unit of wall (Fig. 2.3d). A group of similar cells forms a type of tissue (Fig. 2.7b). Different tissues are organised to form an organ (Fig. 2.7c). Several organs work together to form an organ system that performs a major function of the body (Fig. 2.7d). All the organ systems together make up a complete organism (Fig. 2.7e) — like a plant or an animal. So, the levels of organisations are: Cell Tissue Organ Organ system Organism These levels of organisation help us understand how simple building blocks like cells come together to form a complex living being. The life of complex living organisms begins with a single cell— ‘egg’. The egg of any organism has an amazing ability to divide repeatedly to form a complete living being made up of many cells. Such living beings are called multicellular organisms. Animals, including humans, and plants are all examples of multicellular organisms.

The yolk (the yellow part of an egg) of an ostrich egg is a single cell — the largest known cell in the living world — measuring about 130 mm to 170 mm in diameter. The egg contains extra non-cellular material: a shell for protection and a white liquid that nourishes the cell during its continued development. 2.3 What Are Microorganisms? Some living organisms are made up of just one or very few cells. They are so small that they can not be seen with the naked eye. These are called microorganisms. Some microorganisms, like bacteria and Amoeba, are made of just one cell (unicellular). Others, like some fungi and algae, have many cells (multicellular). They are found all around us — in water, soil, air, and even inside our body! But what do their cells look like? Are they like the plant and animal cells we just learnt about, or are they different? To observe the cells of a microorganism, again, we need to use a microscope which magnifies their size and makes them visible to us. Scientists have also created a low-cost and foldable paper microscope or foldscope. Foldscopes may not provide the same level of details like high-powered laboratory microscopes. However, these make microscopic world accessible to many people. Let us now take a closer look at the fascinating world of microbes. Activity 2.4: Let us observe pond water/ stagnant water z Take a container and collect pond or stagnant water in it with the help of your teacher or elder(s). z Use a dropper and place a drop of pond or stagnant water on a microscope or foldscope slide. Put a coverslip and observe it under the microscope or foldscope. z Observe the tiny organisms found in the pond or stagnant water.

The liquid, which may look dirty, has very fine particles of soil, and is called soil suspension. Keep it aside for some time and let the mixture settle. z Use a dropper and take a drop of water from the top layer. Place the drop on a microscope slide. z Cover it gently with a coverslip and observe it under the microscope (Fig. 2.8). You may observe small moving organisms similar to those you saw in Activity 2.4. This indicates that even soil suspension contains a variety of tiny creatures that cannot be seen with the unaided eye. The tiny creatures that cannot be seen with the naked eye are called microorganisms (micro means very small; organisms means living beings) or microbes.

Let us have a discussion: Have you ever seen a lemon, tomato, orange, or any other food item rot after being left outside for some time? If yes, you may have noticed a powdery or cotton-like growth on them (Fig. 2.9). This happens because they have been infected by microbes. But where did these microbes come from? How did they come in contact with the food? This happens because microorganisms can be found everywhere, be it in water, soil, air, or even in some food items. You can use a foldscope or a microscope to explore surfaces of leaves, stems, roots, or any other part to see them. Like plants and animals, microorganisms also show great diversity. Some of them can even be found in extreme climatic conditions, such as hot water springs and snow cold zones as well as at moderate temperatures. You already know some of these organisms live inside our bodies, especially in our gut! You have studied in the chapter ‘Life Processes in Animals’ in Curiosity, Grade 7 that our intestine has many bacteria that help in digestion. Like plants and animals, microorganisms vary in shape, size, and structure. In Tables 2.1 and 2.2, you would have observed microorganisms of different shapes — spherical, rod-shape, or irregular. How does the diversity of microorganisms play a role in our daily life? How do they help clean the environment? 2.4.1 Key players in cleaning the environment Let us attempt to understand this by doing an activity. Activity 2.7: Let us do z Take an empty container and fill it halfway with garden soil. z Add some fruit and vegetable peels to the container. Thereafter, put a layer of soil on it and leave it aside. This is because you add many spices with salt or sugar to it which act as preservatives. High concentration of salt or sugar do not allow these organisms to grow on them. But why do microorganisms not infect the pickles and murabbas? Fig. 2.9: Fruit with microorganism growing on it"}
{"id": "class 8__science__p39__c1", "text": "Chapter 2 — The Invisible Living World: Beyond Our Naked Eye 19 z After 2–3 weeks, observe the changes that have taken place. z Do you observe any difference in the contents of the container? You may find that peels of fruits and vegetables have turned into a dark-coloured material. This is manure, which is rich in nutrients and helps increase the fertility of the soil. But how did the peels of fruits and vegetables turn into manure? In Activity 2.6, you saw that soil contains various kinds of microorganisms. Some of these microorganisms, like fungi and bacteria, act on the plant waste and slowly break it down into simpler, nutrient-rich manure. You may have seen gardeners in your school or in a field near your house collecting dry leaves and plant waste and putting them into pits. Do you now understand why they do this? It is to make natural manure. Ancient Indian texts, particularly the Vedas, have references of the word ‘Krimi’ which means different tiny entities including ‘Drishya’ (visible) and ‘Adrishya’ (invisible). Various Vedic texts mention their beneficial and harmful effects. Atharvaveda also refers to ‘Krimi’. Our scientific heritage If you look around carefully, you might see decaying plants and fallen leaves stored in a container or lying in the garden, disappear after some time from the surroundings. This is because microorganisms breakdown and turn them into simpler substances rich in nutrients. These nutrients go back to the soil and help plants grow better. Microorganisms also decompose bodies of dead animals. So, microbes help recycle the waste and return important nutrients to nature. Manure formation occurs at optimal temperature and appropriate moisture level. Isn’t it interesting? By now, you must have understood that bacteria and some fungi are types of microorganisms that play an important role in our lives. And guess what, these helpful bacteria can also decompose animal wastes like dung! From Activity 2.7, we can also infer that microorganisms not only help in plant growth, but also clean our environment by breaking down waste. Fig. 2.10: Recycling of nutrients by making manure"}
{"id": "class 8__science__p40__c1", "text": "20 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 Now, think what would have happened if microorganisms did not exist on Earth? A step further Microbes as a source of biogas Many microorganisms, like bacteria and fungi, live in an oxygen- free environment. Some of these bacteria have the ability to decompose plant and animal waste present in the environment or household wastewater. During the process, they release a mixture of gases containing carbon dioxide, and a high proportion of another gas, methane. This gas has been used as a fuel source for cooking, heating, generating electricity, and to even run vehicles. Be a scientist Dr. Ananda Mohan Chakrabarty (1938–2020) was a scientist who studied bacteria. In 1971, he developed a special bacterium that could break down oil spills, helping to clean the environment. His discovery received a patent in 1980. Patent is a copyright given to a person so that no one else can copy, use or sell his/her invention without permission. His work showed how microorganisms could be used to solve environmental problems like pollution. He is remembered for his contributions to science and for protecting the environment using microbes. What are the other problems which you think can be solved with the help of microorganisms? How does the diversity of microorganisms help in our kitchen? 2.4.2 Microorganisms and food Let us try to understand by performing activities in the kitchen. Activity 2.8: Let us perform z Take two bowls A and B. z In each, take 200 g of flour (atta or maida) and add a pinch of sugar. z Now, in bowl A, add a small amount of yeast powder and mix it well with the flour. z In bowl B, do not add any yeast, so that we can compare the results of the two bowls. z Knead the flour of the two bowls with warm water to make soft dough (Fig. 2.11). (a) Dough in bowl A (b) Dough in bowl B Fig. 2.11: Change in the volume of flour after addition of yeast, sugar, and warm water"}
{"id": "class 8__science__p41__c1", "text": "Chapter 2 — The Invisible Living World: Beyond Our Naked Eye 21 z Cover the dough with a damp cloth and keep it in a warm place. z Observe both the bowls after 4–5 hours. Did you find any change in the volume, smell, or texture of the dough? If not, leave the dough for some more time. After some time, you may notice that the dough in bowl A, where yeast was added, has risen slightly, become fluffy, and has a different smell compared to the dough kneaded without yeast. Why does this happen? What is the role of yeast? Why did we add sugar and warm water to the flour? Yeast is a type of microorganism. It belongs to a group of microorganisms, called fungi. Yeast grows well in warm conditions. You may recall from chapter ‘Life Process in Animals’ in Grade 7 that, like other organisms, yeast also respires and breaks down food to release energy for their growth and carry out life processes. During this process, carbon dioxide is released, which forms bubbles that makes the dough soft and fluffy. Yeast also produces a small amount of alcohol during this process, which gives the dough a slightly different smell. This special property of yeast is used in the process of making breads, cakes, and more! In addition to yeast, some bacteria, such as Lactobacillus, help in fermentation of batter for making idli and dosa, and dough for making bhatura. Activity 2.9: Let us prepare z Take two small glass bowls — label them ‘A’ and ‘B’. z Pour lukewarm milk in bowl A, and cold milk in bowl B. z Now, add a small spoonful of curd to each bowl and mix well using a spoon. z Cover both bowls. Keep bowl A in a warm place and bowl B in a cool place (like a refrigerator) for a few hours or overnight. z Observe the changes in the glass bowls.

{"id": "class 8__science__p42__c1", "text": "22 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 You will observe that in bowl A, the milk has turned into curd after a few hours and has become little sour. Whereas in bowl B, the milk has not curdled, but it might be a little sour. Do you know why this happens? The curd contains several types of bacteria. One of them is Lactobacillus. This bacterium feeds on the sugar in the milk (lactose), multiplies, and ferments the milk to form curd. Instead of producing alcohol (like yeast), these bacteria produce lactic acid, which makes curd sour. These bacteria grow well in warm conditions. That is why curd is formed in bowl A but not in bowl B. We can categorise the microorganisms into different categories, such as protozoa, fungi, bacteria, some algae, and more. Some bacteria, such as Rhizobium, form the swollen regions called nodules and live in them as shown in Fig. 2.12. Roots of certain legumes, such as beans, peas, and lentils have root nodules that contain Rhizobium bacteria. These bacteria trap nitrogen from the air and make it useful for the plants. This helps plants grow better without chemical fertilisers. That is why farmers grow legumes in rotation with other crops. This naturally increases the nitrogen in the soil and keeps it healthy for the next crop. 2.4.3 Amazing microalgae: tiny helpers in water Microalgae are microscopic plant-like organisms that live in water, soil, air, and even on trees. They make their own food using sunlight. While doing this, they also release oxygen and produce more than half of the Earth’s oxygen supply. They are rich in nutrients and serve as a food source for many aquatic animals. Some, like Spirulina, Chlorella, and Diatoms, are also used by humans as health supplements and medicines. Microalgae also help in cleaning water and are used to make biofuel. However, pollution, climate change, and habitat destruction are threatening microalgal diversity and abundance. It is important to conserve these tiny organisms to protect the environment and maintain oxygen balance on Earth. Fig. 2.12: Root nodules of Cowpea plant which contain Rhizobium"}
{"id": "class 8__science__p43__c1", "text": "Chapter 2 — The Invisible Living World: Beyond Our Naked Eye 23 Ever heard of ... Spirulina, a microalga, is called a superfood because of its health benefits. Spirulina is also a good source of vitamin B12, which is essential for our body. It has a lot of protein— more than 60 per cent of its body weight—and only a small amount of fat and sugar. Nowadays, farming of Spirulina is becoming a feasible livelihood opportunity. You can grow Spirulina easily by following these steps: 1. \u0007Set a clear glass tank in a bright place away from direct sunlight. 2. \u0007Cover the tank with a shade net, or keep the tank at a place with moderate temperature conditions. 3. \u0007Fill the tank with pond water. 4. \u0007Add living Spirulina collected from a pond. 5. \u0007Stir the growing Spirulina twice a week. 6. \u0007After 3–6 weeks, Spirulina may be harvested from the tank by filtering it through a fine cloth. Conservation of microalgae is a good practice for ensuring food security and livelihood development. 2.5 \u0007Why Is Cell Considered to Be a Basic Unit of Life? The body of all living organisms are made up of tiny building blocks called cells. A single cell contains various components that help organisms perform various functions. The bodies of all plants and animals are made up of many cells. Therefore, they are called multicellular (many-celled) organisms. In multicellular organisms, cells carry out specialised functions individually but also cooperate with each other to increase the chance of survival. Some microorganisms, such as bacteria and protozoa, are made up of just one cell. These are called unicellular (single-celled) organisms. They carry out all the functions necessary for their survival in a single cell. Other microbes, like algae and fungi, are made up of one or more cells. For example, yeast is a unicellular fungus while mould is a multicellular fungus. Nucleoid Fig. 2.13: A bacterial cell showing the nucleoid region"}
{"id": "class 8__science__p44__c1", "text": "24 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 Like animal and plant cells, the cells of microorganisms are also surrounded by a cell membrane. Cells of fungi additionally have a cell wall, but they do not have chloroplasts, so they cannot make their own food through photosynthesis. Bacteria do not have a well-defined nucleus and a nuclear membrane. Instead they have a nucleoid. This feature distinguishes them from cells of yeast, protozoa, algae, fungi, plants, and animals. We have only looked at a few basic cell structures here. The cell has other components about which you will learn in higher classes. For observing subcellular components, we need microscopes with high magnification. An electron microscope magnifies the cell about 10,00,000 times, where we can see more structures present in a cell. By now, you must have understood that all living beings, including microorganisms, are made up of one or more cells. Their cells differ in size, shape, and structure. Plant and animal cells also have some differences. Understanding these differences helps us learn how these organisms function differently. In this chapter, we have learnt about the beneficial microorganisms. However, there are some microbes that cause diseases in plants and animals including humans. We will learn about some of the diseases caused by microbes in the next chapter.

What do the news clippings on the notice board tell you about people’s health in our country? Is being healthy just about not having diseases? Health also includes feeling good physically, staying positive, and having strong relationships. A healthy person takes care of their body, maintains a positive mindset, and enjoys social life. Let us now explore what it truly means to be healthy. Activity 3.1: Let us read A Grade 8 student moved to a new school in another city. With no friends in his new environment and busy parents, he felt lonely. To cope, he spent more time on his phone and social media, but this made him feel worse. He stopped trying to make friends, had headaches, lost weight, and could not sleep well. A doctor advised less screen time and meeting a counsellor. The school counsellor arranged help to support him in making friends and improving his health. Think and Reflect: What was the cause of the boy’s health problems? How did his habits and surroundings affect his well-being? As per the World Health Organization (WHO), health is defined as a ‘state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease’ (Fig. 3.1). A healthy person can perform various tasks more efficiently and cope well in different and difficult situations. A healthy person can adjust well with peer groups and other members of society. Let us understand more about health. Ayurveda teaches us that true health is a balance of body, mind, and surroundings. Following dinacharya (daily routine) and ritucharya (seasonal routine) helps maintain this balance. Eating fresh, wholesome food suited to one’s prakriti (body constitution) is essential. Regular exercise, cleanliness, restful sleep, and a calm mind support overall well-being. This can also be achieved through practices like yoga, meditation, and mindfulness.

A disease is a condition that affects the normal working of the body or mind. It can happen when one or more organs or organ systems stop functioning properly. Some diseases are caused by germs like bacteria, viruses, fungi, worms, or even by protozoa (single-celled organisms). These disease-causing organisms are called pathogens. Other diseases may result from poor nutrition or an unhealthy lifestyle. Some diseases last for a short time, while others can continue for a long time and need regular treatment or care. Diseases can be grouped into two major types based on their causes and how they spread: z Non-communicable diseases— Some diseases, like cancer, diabetes, or asthma, are not caused by pathogens and do not spread from one person to another. They are usually linked to lifestyle, diet, and/or environment. z Communicable diseases— Diseases caused by pathogens are called communicable diseases. They can spread from one person to another. Some examples of communicable diseases are typhoid, dengue, flu, chickenpox, and COVID-19. In recent years, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like diabetes, heart disease, and cancer have become more common in India. This is happening because of changes in how people live — such as eating more processed food, getting less exercise, and living longer lives. Today, most deaths in India are caused by NCDs. Understanding the difference between these two types helps us know how diseases spread and how to prevent them. 3.4.1 How are communicable diseases caused and spread? All communicable diseases are caused by pathogens. These pathogens can enter our body through the air we breathe or by consuming contaminated food or water and more. But how do these pathogens spread from one person to another? One common way is through air, when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through direct contact like shaking hands, or indirectly by sharing Fig. 3.4: Common methods of transmission of diseases Infected person Healthy person Mosquito insects By food Direct contact Indirect contact By air Healthy person Rabid animal"}

Diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and asthma may often persist for a long time (more than 3 months) and are referred to as chronic diseases. Diabetes is a common disease which is becoming more prevalent in adults as well as children. In fact, India now has one of the highest numbers of people with diabetes in the world. It often develops due to a combination of hormonal imbalances, unhealthy eating habits, lack of physical activity, being overweight or obese, and other reasons.

You might have heard the phrase ‘Prevention is better than cure.’ It is important to protect ourselves from both communicable and non-communicable diseases. Activity 3.6: Let us read Odisha — community-led sanitation campaign In Bhadrak district, Odisha, a community sanitation campaign helped more people build and use toilets. This reduced open defecation significantly, and improved child health, with fewer cases of diarrhoea and infections. What do you infer from this case study? Simple steps like good sanitation can greatly reduce the spread of communicable diseases. Find about such community campaigns held in your location. Share in your class and discuss with your peers about the impact of such initiatives. Ability of the body to fight diseases You would have noticed that some people get sick more frequently than others, although living in a similar environment. Do you know why? The natural ability of our body to fight diseases is known as immunity. Our body has a special system called the immune system that helps fight against diseases. You might have taken some drops or injections in your childhood to protect yourself from certain diseases, such as polio, measles, tetanus, and hepatitis. These are vaccines that help prevent serious infections caused by viruses and bacteria. A vaccine helps our body fight certain diseases by training the immune system to recognise and attack harmful germs. providing what is known as acquired immunity — protection developed after exposure to a pathogen or a vaccine. Vaccines can be made in different ways — from weakened or dead pathogens (like viruses or bacteria), or from inactive or harmless parts of the pathogen. Some newer vaccines instruct our own body cells"}

For example, a tetanus shot, often given after an injury protects against infection by the tetanus-causing bacteria. It contains an inactivated bacterial toxin that helps the immune system develop protection without causing the disease. Do you know when the first vaccine was discovered? Edward Jenner and the smallpox vaccine Smallpox was a deadly disease that caused blisters and killed millions. A milder disease called cowpox, seen in cows, could also infect humans. In the late 1700s, English doctor Edward Jenner discovered that people who had cowpox did not get smallpox. This led to the invention of the first vaccine and helped protect people from smallpox. Our scientific heritage Long before modern vaccines, India had a traditional method called variolation to protect against smallpox. It involved using material from a smallpox sore to scratch the skin and create a mild infection and build immunity. People who performed this practice were known as teekedaars. Think like a scientist Observations Jenner observed that milkmaids who had cowpox did not catch smallpox, likely because the two viruses are related. Results He found that people who were infected with cowpox sap were now resistant to smallpox. Application Mass vaccination eventually helped eradicate smallpox worldwide.

It is important to remember that vaccines are preventive, not curative — they can help minimise serious diseases before they happen, but do not treat them once someone is already sick. Some people may fear or doubt vaccines, but scientists and doctors carefully test them for safety. Getting vaccinated not only protects you but also the people around you. Ever heard of ... India’s Role in Vaccine Production India is one of the world’s largest vaccine producers. It manufactures vaccines on a massive scale and supplies them to many countries.

Mohini and Aakarsh, along with their friends, went from one exhibit to another, eagerly exploring different models, asking questions and taking notes. One simple model really fascinated them. It was a working model of a lifting electromagnet which was displayed by their senior, Sumana. In it, instead of a hook like a typical crane, there was an iron nail wrapped with a wire, which was connected to a battery. When Sumana closed the circuit, the nail picked up iron paper clips like a magnet. When she opened the circuit, the clips fell off. Mohini and Aakarsh, were surprised. They remembered learning earlier (in the chapter ‘Exploring Magnets’, Curiosity, Grade 6) that magnetic materials were attracted by magnet and that iron was a magnetic material. But in Sumana’s model, there was no magnet, only an electric circuit. They were so excited that they wanted to try it out themselves. 4.1 \u0007Does an Electric Current Have a Magnetic Effect?

{"id": "class 8__science__p68__c1", "text": "48 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 While watching the compass needle, move the switch to ‘ON’ position to allow electric current to flow through the wire (Fig. 4.1b). What do you observe? z Now again while watching the compass needle, move the switch to ‘OFF’ position. What do you observe this time? z Move the switch between ‘ON’ and ‘OFF’ positions a few more times. Carefully observe how the compass needle behaves the each time. You may have noticed that when the current flows, the compass needle gets deflected from its original direction. When the current stops, the needle returns to its original direction. As we have learnt earlier (in the chapter ‘Exploring Magnets’ in Curiosity, Grade 6), the compass needle is a tiny magnet which deflects when a magnet is brought near it and this magnetic effect can act through any non-magnetic materials kept in between. But why does the compass needle deflect when the current flows through the wire? The deflection indicates that the current carrying wire has a magnetic effect on the compass needle. When the current stops, this magnetic effect disappears and the compass needle returns to its original direction. The region around a magnet or a current carrying wire where its magnetic effect can be felt, such as by the deflection of a compass needle, is said to have a magnetic field. When electric current flows through a conductor (like a wire), it produces a magnetic field around it. This phenomenon is known as the magnetic effect of electric current. The magnetic field disappears when the current stops flowing. Be a scientist You have just now made the same discovery which was made by the scientist Hans Christian Oersted (1777–1851) in 1820, that is, the discovery that electricity and magnetism are linked. He was a professor at a university in Denmark. It is said that once while giving a demonstration, he noticed that whenever an electrical circuit was closed or opened, the needle of a magnetic compass, lying nearby, deflected. He investigated this and when he was certain that an electric current indeed produced a magnetic field, he published his findings. This led to other scientists repeating his experiment to check if they got the same results, and further investigating the connection between electricity and magnetism. We have learnt about magnets and electric current in earlier grades. I used to think that there was no link between the two. But now we found that electricity and magnetic effect are linked!"}

Take care to not connect the wires to the cell for more than a few seconds; otherwise, the cell may weaken quickly. z Bring the nail close to the iron paper clips and lift up. Do the clips hang to the ends of the nail? z Disconnect the wire from the cell to stop the flow of electric current in the wire. Do the clips fall down?

Is there any difference in the deflection of the compass needles? z Place some iron paper clips near the two ends of the nail. Are the clips attracted to the ends of the nail? It is observed that when current is passed through the cylindrical coil, it behaves like a magnet and deflects the needle of a magnetic compass. When an iron nail is inserted in the core of the coil, then the coil becomes a stronger magnet and the deflection of the magnetic compass needle is much more. It also attracts iron clips (Fig. 4.3e). When the current is stopped, the cylindrical coil loses its magnetic effect. A current carrying coil that behaves as a magnet is called an electromagnet. For practical applications, most electromagnets have an iron core to make them stronger. Does electromagnet also have two poles like a bar magnet?

{"id": "class 8__science__p71__c1", "text": "Chapter 4 — Electricity: Magnetic and Heating Effects 51 As we have learnt earlier, when two magnets are brought close to each other, their unlike poles (North–South) attract each other. So, if north pole of the magnetic compass is attracted towards end A of the electromagnet, then end A is south pole. z Repeat this procedure to find the polarity of end B as well (Fig. 4.4b). Did you find that the polarity of end B is opposite to the polarity of end A? We learnt in grade 6 that a magnet has two poles. Just like a magnet, an electromagnet also has two poles — North and South. Think like a scientist Repeat Activity 4.3 with — (i) 2 and 4 cells with the same coil, (ii) 2 cells but different number of turns of the coil. What do you observe? A single cell provides only a small amount of current, so the magnetic field is weak. As a result, the deflection of compass needle is less and the coil can only attract a few clips. A battery with more cells gives a larger current as compared to that with a single cell. This creates a stronger magnetic field, so the deflection of the compass needle is more and the coil can attract more clips. The increase in number of turns of the coil also makes the coil a stronger magnet! Also, repeat Activity 4.4 by changing the direction of the current. So, the strength of an electromagnet can be changed by changing the amount of electric current flowing through the coil or the number of turns of the coil, or both. Also, its poles can be reversed by changing the direction of the current. Do you remember learning earlier (in the chapter ‘Exploring Magnets’ in Curiosity, Grade 6) that a freely suspended magnet rests along the north–south direction because our Earth itself behaves like a giant magnet? But why does Earth behave like a magnet? Deep inside the Earth, the movement of liquid iron in the core creates electric currents, which generate a magnetic field. Many migratory birds, fish, and animals use this field to navigate across continents and oceans. The Earth’s magnetic field also acts as a shield, blocking harmful particles from space, and helps protect life on Earth.

The crane operator can control the magnet by switching the current ON and OFF. When the current is turned ON, the electromagnet lifts the iron/steel objects; when the current is switched OFF, magnetic field disappears, and the objects are released. Lifting electromagnets are widely used in factories and scrap yards, to move, lift, and sort heavy metal items efficiently. A step further We have learnt that when electric current flows through a conductor (like a wire), it produces a magnetic field around it. In the higher grades, you will learn even more about this wonderful link between electricity and magnetism, including the exciting idea that just as electricity can produce magnetism, a moving magnet can also lead to an electric current. This deep connection between electricity and magnetism is vital to our daily lives, as it forms the basis of many devices, from electric motors to power generators. 4.2 Does a Current Carrying Wire Get Hot? Activity 4.5: Let us observe In this activity, we will use a special kind of wire, called a nichrome wire. z Take a cardboard piece of about 10 cm length and 10 cm width, two nails, a nichrome wire of thickness about 0.3 mm (26–28 gauge) and length of 10 cm, an electric cell, a cell holder, a switch, and connecting wires. z Mount the nails on the cardboard about 5 cm apart. z Tie the nichrome wire between these nails and make the connections as shown in Fig. 4.5 with the switch in OFF position. z Touch the nichrome wire.

{"id": "class 8__science__p73__c1", "text": "Chapter 4 — Electricity: Magnetic and Heating Effects 53 (Do not hold the nichrome wire). What difference do you feel? z Repeat the last two steps to confirm the observation. You may have observed that nichrome wire feels warm when current is passed through it. This happens because, when electric current flows through any conductor, it faces some opposition or resistance to its flow. Different conductors offer different levels of resistance to the flow of current. A nichrome wire, for example, offers higher resistance compared to a copper wire of the same size and length. This resistance causes some of the electrical energy to be converted into heat energy. When an electric current passes through a conductor, it gets heated. This warming is known as the heating effect of electric current. Think like a scientist This activity should be carried out strictly under the supervision of a teacher. Repeat Activity 4.5 with a battery of 2 cells. What do you notice? For the same duration, does the wire heat up more with one cell or two cells? The amount of heat generated is more in the experiment with 2 cells. This is due to the fact that the heat generated depends on the magnitude of the electric current. The heat generated in a wire depends on the material, thickness, and length of the wire, and the duration for which the current flows. In Grade 7, we have learnt that an incandescent lamp glows because its filament is heated by an electric current. Many household appliances, such as electric room heaters, stoves, irons, immersion rods, water heaters, kettles, and hair dryers (Fig. 4.6) work on the same principle of the heating effect of electric current. All these devices contain a rod or a coil of wire, called a heating element. In some appliances where this element is visible, it can be seen glowing red hot.

Let us start with one of the earliest types of electric cells ever made. 4.3.1 Voltaic cell A Voltaic cell, also known as Galvanic cell, is shown in Fig. 4.7. It contains two metal plates made of different materials and a liquid called an electrolyte, placed in a glass or plastic container. The plates, called electrodes, are partly dipped in the electrolyte, which is usually a weak acid or salt solution. A chemical reaction between the plates and the electrolyte produces electricity. When the circuit is connected, electric current flows from the positive terminal through the circuit to the negative terminal. Over time, the chemicals get used up, and the cell stops working. It is then called ‘dead’ and cannot supply any more electricity. Ever heard of ... The Voltaic or Galvanic cells get their names from two Italian scientists, Alessandro Volta and Luigi Galvani. In the late 1700s, Galvani noticed that a dead frog’s leg kicked when touched with two different metals — copper and iron. It was already known by then that electricity could stimulate muscular motion and Galvani thought the electricity came from the frog itself. But Volta had a different idea. He believed the electricity came from the metals, and not the frog. To test this, he used saltwater-soaked paper instead of the frog’s leg and still got an electric current. This showed that it was the combination of metals and liquid that generated electric current — leading to the invention of the first battery!

Instead, dry cells are one of the most widely used electric cells today. They are called ‘dry’ because the electrolyte is not a liquid but a thick moist paste. The structure of a dry cell is shown in Fig. 4.9. It consists of a zinc container which acts as a negative terminal and a carbon rod at the centre covered with metal cap that acts as the positive terminal. The carbon rod is surrounded by the paste-like electrolyte. The dry cell is a single use cell, meaning once it is used up, it has to be disposed of.

Their summer vacation had just begun, and they wanted to explore the beautiful landscapes around their village. After pumping air into their bicycle tyres, they set off. As they rode through the village, the wind rushed past them. “Oh no! The wind is pushing me hard!” said Ragini. Smiling, Sonali replied, “We are riding against the wind. We must push our pedals harder to move faster.” Their ride took them up a long path to a hilltop. Some parts of the road were rough where they found it hard to pedal, while other parts were smoother. When they reached the top and were enjoying the view, they heard thunder and saw flashes of lightning at a distance. Even though it looked beautiful, they decided to head back immediately. On the way back, while passing a herd of sheep, they pressed their bicycle bells and turned the handles to change direction. As they were coming down the slope of the hill, they realised that their bicycles were moving down at a great speed even though they were not pedalling! Sonali yelled, “It’s thrilling!

What effect can the application of force have on objects? The force applied on an object may z make an object move from rest. z change the speed of an object if it is moving. z change the direction of motion of an object. z bring about a change in the shape of an object. z cause some or all of these effects. 5.3 \u0007Are Forces an Interaction Between Two or More Objects? When you push a table, your hand is one object applying force on another object — the table. Here, we say that your hand and the table are two objects interacting with each other. Think of all the actions listed in Table 5.1. How many objects are involved in each of the actions? Do you notice that forces result only when two objects are interacting in some way or the other? From these examples, we can infer that at least two objects must interact for a force to come into play. A force is a push or pull on an object resulting from the object’s interaction with another object. The SI unit of force is newton (written with a small ‘n’) and its symbol is N. A step further Suppose an object is at rest. Does it mean that no force is acting on this object? It means that the forces acting on the object are balancing one another. You will learn about balanced forces in higher grades. Does this mean that whenever there is a change in speed or direction, or change in shape, a force is acting on the object? Yes, none of these take place without the action of force."}

The moment you stopped pushing, the force on your hand disappeared. Whenever two objects interact, each object experiences a force from the other. As soon as the interaction ceases, the two objects no longer experience the force. 5.4 What Are the Different Types of Forces? 5.4.1 Contact forces In many situations, we find that to apply a force on an object, physical contact is necessary between our body and the object. This contact can be direct, such as using our hands or other body parts, or indirect, such as using a stick or rope. Forces of this type which act only when there is physical contact between the objects are called contact forces. Muscular force An example of contact force is muscular force. When we perform any physical activity, such as walking, running, lifting, pushing, jumping, or stretching, the force is caused by the action of muscles in our body. The force resulting due to the action of muscles is known as muscular force. Muscular force occurs when muscles contract and elongate while doing any activity. Animals, birds, fish, and insects use muscular forces for movement and survival."}

Fig. 5.4: Use of muscular force of animals to assist with human tasks Ever heard of ... Muscular force plays an important role in many functions inside our body too. This force helps us chew food and push it through the alimentary canal during the process of digestion. The expansion and contraction of our heart muscles allows the blood to circulate in our body — a process essential for survival. Friction A ball rolling on a flat ground stops on its own after some time. If we stop pedalling our bicycle on a flat road, it slows down and comes to a stop. If the road is rough, it stops sooner than on a smoother road. You must have come across many such experiences. What causes the change in the speed of objects in such situations? We have learnt earlier that a force is essential to change the speed of an object. However, in all these situations no force appears to be acting on the objects, yet their speed gradually decreases and they come to a stop after some time. Is it possible that some force is indeed acting on them? Which force is that? Activity 5.3: Let us investigate z Take an object with a flat base (such as an empty lunch box/ geometry box/ a notebook) and place it on a table or floor. z Gently push it and observe. Does it stop after travelling some distance? Is there a force acting on it which brings it to rest? z Now repeat by pushing the object in the opposite direction. Does it stop again after travelling some distance? Is there any other contact force?"}
{"id": "class 8__science__p88__c1", "text": "68 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 On pushing, the object stops after sliding a certain distance. This must be due to a force acting between the surfaces of the sliding object and the table or floor which are in contact. This force must be acting on the object in a direction opposite to its direction of motion. This force is what brings the object to a stop. The force that comes into play when an object moves or tries to move over another surface is called the force of friction or simply friction. Friction always acts in a direction opposite to the direction in which the object is moving or trying to move. The force of friction is a contact force since it arises due to two surfaces in contact. Friction arises due to the irregularities in the two surfaces in contact. Even surfaces which appear smooth, have a large number of minute irregularities (Fig. 5.6). When placed in contact, the irregularities of two surfaces lock into each other and oppose any effort to move one surface over the other. Fig. 5.6: Friction between two surfaces due to irregularities Fig. 5.5: Friction acts between two surfaces and opposes the motion of the object. Activity 5.4: Let us explore z Try Activity 5.3 again, but this time place the same object on different surfaces, such as glass, cloth, wood, ceramic tile, and sand. z Does the object stop after travelling the same distance as in Activity 5.3? z Does the object stop at the same distance on all surfaces? For different surfaces, the object stops after moving different distances so we can say that the force of friction depends upon the nature of the surfaces in contact. Friction is greater on rough surfaces. A step further Does the force or friction act only if the objects are moving on solid surfaces? What about objects moving through liquids and gases? Air, water, and other liquids also exert force of friction on the objects moving through them. Hence the objects, such as aeroplanes, ships, boats, or high-speed trains are designed with specific shapes to reduce the force of friction due to the air or water around them. Does this mean that the force of friction will be greater if the surfaces are rough?"}

These forces are called non-contact forces. Let us learn about non-contact forces. Magnetic force Do you remember learning about magnets in the chapter ‘Exploring Magnets’ in Curiosity, Grade 6? We learnt that a magnet attracts objects made of magnetic materials. When two magnets are brought close to each other, like poles (North–North, South–South) repel each other while unlike poles (North–South) attract each other. In an earlier chapter of this book, we also learnt about electromagnets which behave like magnets. Attraction and repulsion between objects are also a form of push and pull, that is, a force. Can you recall that a magnet could exert force on another magnet or a magnetic material without being in contact with it? Activity 5.5: Let us test z Take two ring magnets and a wooden stick. z While holding the stick in a vertical position over a wooden table, insert one ring magnet onto the stick (Fig. 5.7). z Now insert the second ring magnet above it such that the like poles of the two magnets face each other. Does the second magnet stay floating above the first magnet? z Try pushing the second magnet down gently. Do you feel a force on it? z Now, reverse the poles of both the magnets. Does the second magnet still remain floating? We find that a magnet can exert force on another magnet without being in contact with it. The force exerted by a magnet on another magnet or a magnetic material is called magnetic force. Since a magnet can exert a force from a distance without being in contact it is called a non-contact force. Are there more such forces which act from a distance?

Do you notice something surprising? The paper pieces get pulled towards the plastic scale/straw and stick to it when it is brought close to paper pieces. Why does this happen? When two objects of certain materials are rubbed together, electrical charges build up on their surfaces. These charges are called static charges as they do not move by themselves. The object that acquires static charges is said to be a charged object. A charged object attracts, that is, exerts a force on uncharged objects made of certain materials, such as small pieces of paper. This force comes into play even when the bodies are not in contact. Let us do another activity with objects made of different materials. Activity 5.7: Let us experiment z Take two balloons, a length of thread, and a woollen cloth. z Inflate two balloons and hang them in such a way that they do not touch each other as shown in Fig. 5.9a. z Rub both balloons with the woollen cloth and release them.

What happens? They move towards each other as if they are attracting each other. What do we infer from these observations?

{"id": "class 8__science__p91__c1", "text": "Chapter 5 — Exploring Forces 71 We found that the two similarly charged balloons repel each other whereas a charged balloon and the woollen cloth (with which the balloon was rubbed) attract each other. Does this indicate that the charge on the balloon is of a different kind from the charge on the woollen cloth? Since the balloons were charged in the same way, we can say that they have acquired similar charges. As the similarly charged balloons repelled each other, we can infer that similar (like) charges repel each other. Both the rubbing object and the rubbed object get charged but they acquire opposite kind of charges. Their attraction shows that opposite kind (unlike) of charges attract each other. The two kinds of static charges are said to be ‘positive’ and ‘negative’. The force exerted by a charged body on another charged body or an uncharged body is called electrostatic force. It is a non-contact force. Does it mean that there are two kinds of electrical charges? Gravitational force Activity 5.8: Let us observe z Take a ball and throw it vertically upwards.

{"id": "class 8__science__p92__c1", "text": "72 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 Since all the objects fall towards the Earth, it means the Earth attracts (pulls) them. The force with which the Earth attracts objects towards itself is called the gravitational force. The gravitational force exerted by the Earth is also called force of gravity or simply gravity. Since the gravitational force acts without contact with the object it attracts, it is a non-contact force. Gravitational force is always an attractive force, unlike magnetic force or electrostatic force, which can either be attractive or repulsive. You might have noticed that when an object is dropped from a height, it takes a straight vertical path downwards before touching the ground (Fig. 5.11a). When an object is thrown vertically upwards, the object moves up straight, slows down, stops momentarily at the top, and then takes a straight vertical path downwards (Fig. 5.11b). While going up, the speed of the object goes on decreasing till the object comes to a stop, its direction of motion changes and while coming down the speed goes on increasing. We say that the object undergoes a vertical motion when it moves in a vertical direction under the influence of the gravitational force. 5.5 Weight and Its Measurement The force with which the Earth pulls an object towards itself is called the weight of the object. The weight measures how strongly an object is pulled by the Earth. Since the weight is a force, it is measured in the same unit as that of force. Therefore, SI unit of weight is also newton (N). Is there any force which acts on them? What exerts this force? Why do all the objects fall towards the Earth? Does the Earth pull every object with equal force?

Activity 5.9: Let us explore z Take a spring and a few objects of different masses, such as a pencil box, a tiffin box, and a small stone. z Hang one end of the spring from a nail. From the other end, hang an object and observe the spring. Does the spring stretch? z Now hang the other objects, one by one and notice the stretch in the spring each time. Is the stretch caused by each object the same? When an object is hung from a spring, the spring stretches due to the force applied on the object by the Earth. We find that the stretch caused in the spring is different for different objects. This indicates that the Earth pulls different objects with different forces, that is, the weight of different objects is different. Can we use the spring to measure the weight of an object? A step further A spring balance is a simple device used to measure weight (force). It consists of a spring fixed at one end, with a hook attached at the other end. When we hang an object from the hook, the spring stretches, and the amount of stretching gives the weight of the object. There is a scale on the balance which is marked to show the weight (force) in newton. Usually, there is also another scale to show the corresponding values of mass in gram (g). These values have been marked with the assumption that the spring balance is used on the Earth, with the Earth’s gravitational force attracting the object. (b) Fig. 5.12: (a) A hanging spring; (b) Two different objects hung from the spring (a) Let us learn to measure the weight using a spring balance.

The weight difference indicated between 0 and 01 N or between 01 N and 02 N is 1 N. { How many divisions (shown by smaller marks) are there between these two bigger marks? There are 5 divisions between these marks. { How much weight does one small division indicate? Fig. 5.14: Object suspended from a spring balance One small division can read 1 N 5 = 0.2 N.

A step further The mass of an object can be measured indirectly by measuring its weight (using a spring balance) or by comparing its weight with the weight of an object of a known mass (using a beam balance). Since the weight of an object remains almost the same everywhere on the Earth, so for all practical purposes it is acceptable to weigh an object to find its mass. As we have learnt earlier (in the chapter ‘Materials Around Us’ in Curiosity, Grade 6), mass is the amount of matter in an object and is measured in grams (g) or kilograms (kg). Its value remains the same at every place. Weight, on the other hand, is the gravitational force with which the Earth (or another planet) pulls an object. Since gravitational force can vary very slightly from place to place on the Earth (and can be very different on different planets), weight can change, but mass does not. What is the difference between weight and mass? A step further The gravitational force of different planets on an object is different. Thus, the weight of an object is different on different planets, as shown in the following table, even though its mass remains the same. Planet Earth Moon Mars Venus Jupiter Mass of the object 1 kg 1 kg 1 kg 1 kg 1 kg Weight of the object 10 N 1.6 N 3.8 N 9 N 25.4 N A step further In everyday life, particularly for the goods we commonly use, we are more interested in the amount of matter in an object (its mass), rather than the force applied by the Earth upon it (its weight). However, though while the units of mass are used, instead of the term mass, the term weight is typically used. For example, it is said that the weight of the wheat bag is 10 kg. But in scientific use, this is not correct and it is important to use the correct terms with their correct units, even if every day language is more casual."}

Do you feel an upward push? Release the bottle. Does it bounce up? You would have felt an upward push and the bottle bounces back to the surface of the water. This indicates that water applies a force on the bottle in the upward direction. In fact, all liquids apply a similar force. The force applied by a liquid on an object in the upward direction is known as upthrust or buoyant force. When an object is placed in a liquid, the gravitational force due to the Earth acts on it downwards. But a buoyant force is applied on it by the liquid in the upward direction. If the gravitational force is more than the buoyant force, the object sinks, but if the two forces are equal, the object floats. One of the factors on which the buoyant force depends upon, is the density of the liquid. You will learn about density in a later chapter of this book. Fig. 5.15: Plastic bottle in water A step further Archimedes, a famous Greek scientist, discovered that when an object is fully or partially immersed in a liquid, it experiences an upward force which is equal to the weight of the liquid it displaces. This is known as Archimedes’ Principle. If the weight of a liquid displaced by an object is smaller than the weight of the object, the object will sink in the liquid. If the weight of the liquid displaced is equal to the weight of the object, the object will float in the liquid. 5.6 Floating and Sinking While taking out water from a bucket filled with water using a mug, do you notice that the mug feels lighter when it is inside water? Let us try to understand this. If we place some objects on water, some of them float, while others fall to the bottom. The gravitational force of the Earth is acting on all objects, then why don’t all objects fall to the bottom? Ever heard of ... There are some rocks which can float on water. One such rock is Pumice, which is formed during volcanic eruptions. When lava with lots of gas and water vapour cools quickly, it traps tiny bubbles of gas inside. This creates a light, porous rock — filled with air pockets which is less dense than water and floats on it."}

Have you ever wondered why fallen leaves rise in the air or trees sway or bend? Does the wind exert force on fallen leaves to make them rise or on trees to bend? Recall other similar effects of the force exerted by wind like slamming of doors or rattling of windows, or fluttering of clothes? How does the force exerted by wind make this happen? The force exerted by wind creates wind pressure which causes these effects. In this chapter, we will explore the relationship between force and pressure, and understand how they shape powerful natural events like thunderstorms and cyclones. 6.1 Pressure Megha and her brother Pawan are going on a picnic. They walk to the picnic spot, carrying identical items in their bags (Fig. 6.1). On the way, Pawan keeps adjusting his bag, and looks uncomfortable. Megha asks, “Is there a problem with your bag?” Pawan responds, “Yes, it is hurting my shoulders.” Megha says, “Both our bags are equally heavy. Why does your bag hurt, and mine doesn’t?” Pawan reflects for a minute and says, “Perhaps, it is because of the difference in the straps of our bags. My bag has narrow straps while your bag has broad straps.” Can the shape or size of the straps really make a difference? Let us try to find out. When we carry a bag, we feel its weight because of the force of gravity acting on our shoulders. The weight of the bag with narrow straps acts on a smaller area of our shoulders, whereas the weight of the bag with broad straps is spread out over a larger area of our shoulders. It is due to this reason that we feel more comfortable carrying a bag with broader straps than one with narrow straps, although both bags have the same weight. Since the area over which the force acts is involved, we define a quantity called pressure, which is the force per unit area. So, Pressure = Force Area At this stage, we will consider only those forces which act perpendicular to the surface on which the pressure is to be computed. Fig. 6.1: Megha and Pawan carrying their bags"}
{"id": "class 8__science__p102__c1", "text": "82 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 Broad straps reduce the pressure exerted by the bag on our shoulders as compared to narrow straps. Therefore, we feel more comfortable carrying a bag with broad straps. Can you now understand why it feels easier to lift a water-filled bucket with a broad handle than with a narrow handle (Fig. 6.2)? Similarly, we have seen that when people carry loads like pots or vegetable baskets on their heads, they often place a round piece of cloth under the loads (Fig. 6.3). In both cases, the objective is to reduce pressure by increasing the area over which the weight acts. Pressure is defined as the force per unit area. The SI unit of force is newton and that of area is metre2. Therefore, the SI unit of pressure is newton/metre2 (N/m2). This unit is also called a pascal, denoted by Pa. If a force of 100 N is applied on a cardboard of area 2 m2, then the pressure applied on the cardboard will be: Pressure = = 50 N/m2 = Force Area 100 N 2 m2 There are many situations in daily life where pressure plays a role.

{"id": "class 8__science__p103__c1", "text": "Chapter 6 — Pressure, Winds, Storms, and Cyclones 83 What can you conclude from your observations in Table 6.1? We conclude that when the area over which a force applied is smaller, the resulting pressure is higher, making it easier to do certain tasks. This is why it is easier to drive a nail using its pointed end, and it is easier to cut an apple with the sharp edge of a knife. You must have seen overhead water tanks (Fig. 6.4) in your locality, or on the rooftops of houses used for water supply. Why are these tanks always placed at a height? Do liquids also exert pressure? Let us find out by conducting the following activity. Activity 6.1: Let us try and find out z Take two transparent glass or plastic pipes of the same length (about 25 cm), but of different diameters, as shown in Fig. 6.5. z Take two good-quality rubber balloons. Attach them to one end of each pipe. z Clamp the pipes on a stand as shown in Fig. 6.5. z Now, fill both the pipes with water up to the same level about halfway. z Observe what happens to the balloons. z Do both balloons bulge? Do they bulge to the same extent? What can you infer from this activity? You must have observed that the two balloons bulge to the same extent. Why is it so? Notice that because of the different diameters, the weight of water in the two pipes is different. However, the bulge in both the balloons is the same. This means that the weight of water in the pipes could not be responsible for the extent of the bulge of the balloons. Could it be that the water column is exerting pressure? Yes, it is the pressure exerted by the water column which is responsible for the bulge. That is why equal water column heights produce equal bulges in the balloons, despite their different diameters. Fig. 6.4: Overhead tank Fig. 6.5: Equal heights of water columns produce same bulge in balloons Broad pipe Balloons Water Narrow pipe Stand"}
{"id": "class 8__science__p104__c1", "text": "84 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 Pour some more water in any one of the pipes used in Fig. 6.5. Observe the bulge of the balloon. Repeat this process a few times, adding more water each time and noting the extent of bulge as shown in Fig. 6.6. Do you see any relation between the amount of bulge of the rubber balloon and the height of the water column in the pipe? You must have observed that the bulge of the balloon increases as the height of the water column increases. Thus, as the height of the water column in the pipe increases, the pressure at the bottom of the pipe also increases, which causes the balloon to bulge more. So, we can say that the pressure exerted by a liquid in a vessel depends on the height of its column. This is the reason why overhead tanks are placed at a height so that the pressure in the taps is increased, resulting in a good stream of water from the taps. Suppose you are living on the second floor of a three-storeyed building and an overhead water tank is placed on the top floor. Will you or your friend on the first floor receive a more powerful stream of tap water?

{"id": "class 8__science__p105__c1", "text": "Chapter 6 — Pressure, Winds, Storms, and Cyclones 85 You observe water flowing out through the holes on the sides of the bottle. What can you infer from this observation? It indicates that water also exerts pressure on the sides of a container. Therefore, we can conclude that liquids exert pressure not only at the bottom of the container, but also on its sides. In fact liquids exert pressure in all directions. You must have seen water spurting out like a fountain from leaking joints or holes in water pipes. Can you explain why this happens? Is it due to the pressure exerted by water on the walls of the pipes? Ever heard of ... Do you know that the base of a dam is much broader than the top? This is because a broad base not only supports the structure of the dam, but also withstands the horizontal water pressure near the bottom (Fig. 6.8). The water stored in the dam, exerts pressure horizontally on the side walls of the dam and vertically on the floor due to the height of the water level. The pressure which acts horizontally, is very large near its bottom. Thus, to withstand the pressure, the base of the dam is made broader. Fig. 6.8: Dam Let us now try to understand if air also exerts pressure. 6.2 Pressure Exerted by Air You already know that air is all around us. The envelope of air surrounding the Earth is called atmosphere. The atmospheric air contains nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, and other gases in small quantities. The atmosphere extends up to many kilometres above the surface of the Earth. Let us find out if the atmosphere exerts pressure by performing the following activity.

Place the folded sheet on top of the inverted paper plate as shown in Fig. 6.9b. z Now, try to lift the paper plate covered with a folded sheet using the stick. z Observe how much effort is needed to lift it. z Now, place the second unfolded chart paper sheet in place of the folded sheet. Make a hole at the centre of this chart paper for the stick to pass through. Cover the paper plate with the unfolded chart paper as shown in Fig. 6.9 c. z \u0007Lift the paper plate again and feel the effort needed in doing so. z In which case is the lifting easier, with the folded or the unfolded chart paper covering the paper plate? You would have observed that more effort is needed to lift the paper plate when it is covered with the unfolded chart paper, than with the folded chart paper. When we cover the paper plate with unfolded chart paper, the area of the covering sheet increases. The effort needed to lift the paper plate increases. Notice that the weight of the covering sheet has not changed. What can you infer from this? We can infer from these observations that air exerts force on the covering sheet, which makes it difficult to lift the paper plate. Moreover, this force increases with Fig. 6.10: A girl blowing a balloon Fig. 6.9: (c) Inverted paper plate with unfolded chart paper Fig. 6.9: (b) Inverted paper plate with two folds of chart paper increase in the area of covering sheets. It means that the air is exerting a force on the paper plate, which increases as the area of the sheet covering it increases. As force per unit area is pressure, we can conclude that air exerts pressure on the paper sheet. In fact, air exerts pressure on all objects. The pressure exerted by air around us is known as the atmospheric pressure. You must have experienced that when you blow air into a balloon, it gets inflated. Why? This is because the air being filled inside the balloon exerts pressure on the walls of the balloon (Fig 6.10). Can we say that air exerts pressure in all directions? Yes, that is why the balloon expands in all directions. What happens when an inflated balloon is kept without closing its mouth? The air escapes from the balloon. Why does the air escape from the balloon?"}
{"id": "class 8__science__p107__c1", "text": "Chapter 6 — Pressure, Winds, Storms, and Cyclones 87 Have you ever wondered how large the atmospheric pressure is? Let us get an idea about its magnitude by performing the following activity. Activity 6.4: Let us perform z Take a good-quality rubber sucker. Press it firmly against a smooth flat surface (Fig. 6.11). z Do you realise that it sticks to the surface? z Now, try to pull it off. Do you find it difficult to pull it off? When we press the sucker, most of the air between its cup and the surface on which it is placed is pushed out and the air pressure inside it is reduced. The sucker sticks to the surface because the pressure of air surrounding the sucker is higher than the pressure exerted by the air inside the sucker. To pull the sucker off the surface, the applied force should be strong enough to overcome the pressure difference between outside the sucker and inside the sucker. Do you know how large the atmospheric pressure is? The force exerted by the atmospheric air column over an area 15 cm × 15 cm is nearly equal to the force of gravity on an object of mass 225 kg (2250 N). The reason we are not crushed under this weight is that the pressure inside our bodies is also equal to the atmospheric pressure. This balances the pressure exerted from outside. The pressure inside our body is caused by the movement of fluids and gases in tissues and organs of the body. 6.3 Formation of Wind You must have noticed that on some days, the wind blows strongly, whereas on other days, it is calm. Sometimes, wind becomes so strong that it causes damage to life and property. You must have seen that when an inflated balloon is kept without closing its mouth, the air from the balloon escapes. Recall that when there is a puncture in the bicycle tube, the air escapes and the tube collapses. In both of these cases, does air move from a high pressure region to a low pressure region? The SI unit of pressure is N/m2, also known as pascal (Pa). However, the practical unit of air pressure is millibar (mb), which is equal to 100 Pa. Air pressure is also expressed in hectopascal (hPa), which is equal to 100 Pa. Fig. 6.11: A sucker A step further"}
{"id": "class 8__science__p108__c1", "text": "88 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 Let us find out from the following activity. Activity 6.5: Let us observe z Take two similar balloons made of thin rubber, and a drinking straw. z Insert one end of the straw into one balloon and secure it with a rubber band or thread. z Now inflate the second balloon and hold its mouth with your fingers, so that air does not escape. z Insert the free end of the straw into the neck of the inflated balloon and secure it with a rubber band or thread. Make sure that the air does not leak from the balloon as the straw is inserted in it. Now you have one end of the straw inside the inflated balloon and the other end inside the uninflated balloon as shown in Fig. 6.12. z Predict what would happen to the balloons. z Observe what happens to both the balloons. Did it happen as predicted? z Do you observe any change in the size of the balloons? Write down your observations. .................................................................................................................... What can be the reason for the change in the sizes of the balloons? The air pressure in the inflated balloon is higher than that in the uninflated balloon. As a result, some air moves from the inflated balloon to the uninflated balloon, resulting in changes in the size of both the balloons. Do you notice that after some time both the balloons attain almost the same size and the flow of air stops? Why does the air flow stop? The flow of air continues till the air pressure in the inflated balloon is higher than the air pressure in the uninflated balloon. The air flow stops when the pressure in both balloons becomes equal. At this stage, both balloons are almost of the same size. Thus, we can conclude that air moves from a region of high air pressure to a region of low air pressure. You can relate this conclusion to the directions of the sea breeze and land breeze, which you studied in Curiosity, Grade 7. As land gets heated faster than water during the day, the air above the land How do winds form? Does the difference in air pressure have anything to do with the formation of winds?

The air from the high pressure region of the sea blows to the low pressure region which develops on the land, resulting in a sea breeze. At night, the water is warmer than the land. Therefore, a low pressure area develops above the sea. As a result, wind blows from the land to the sea, giving rise to land breeze. Thus, the phenomenon of land breeze and sea breeze is mainly due to the pressure differences over the land and the sea. If we could measure the speed of the escaping air in Activity 6.5, we would find that the speed of the air is higher if the pressure difference is higher. I have read that high-speed winds can blow off roofs. I wonder how? 6.4 \u0007High-Speed Winds Result in Lowering of Air Pressure Activity 6.6: Let us observe z Take two balloons of the same size. z Inflate both balloons and tie strings to them. z Hang the two balloons from a stick, leaving a gap of 6–10 cm (Fig. 6.13). z Now, blow air into the narrow space between the balloons. z What happens to the balloons? Note down your observations. z Now blow harder and observe. When you blow between the two balloons, you observe that they move towards each other. This happens because when you blow air between the balloons, a low pressure area is created between them. The higher air pressure surrounding the balloon pushes them towards each other. You must have observed that blowing harder increases the speed at which the balloons approach each other. What can you infer from this activity? We infer that high speed winds are accompanied by a reduced air pressure. Fig. 6.13: Blowing between two balloons"}
{"id": "class 8__science__p110__c1", "text": "90 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 When high-speed winds blow over houses, a low-pressure area is created over them, as high-speed winds are accompanied by a reduced pressure. Therefore, the air pressure above the roofs of the houses is lower than the pressure below them. If the pressure difference is large and the roofs are weak, they may be blown away, as shown in Fig. 6.14 a. That is why it is safer to keep doors and windows of the houses open during storms with high-speed winds. When the same wind moves over the roofs, and through the houses, the pressure difference between inside of the houses and over the roofs is reduced to a large extent. This helps prevent the roofs from being blown off as shown in Fig. 6.14 b. You must have experienced that when high-speed winds blow during storms, they are sometimes accompanied by thunder and lightning. Let us learn more about them. 6.5 Storms, Thunderstorms, and Lightning Fig. 6.14: (b) Roof of a house intact Fig. 6.14: (a) Roof of a house blown away Have you heard the sound of thunder and seen lightning during the rainy season? Yes, the sound of thunder is so frightening! Usually there is heavy rainfall too. When land gets heated, the warm and moist air, being lighter, rises, thereby creating a low pressure area. Cooler air from the surrounding high-pressure areas flows to take its place. This air, in turn, gets heated and rises. This results in a continuous process of wind circulation. As the rising air expands, it cools and moisture in it condenses to form water droplets, creating clouds. The water droplets merge to form heavier drops, which come down as rain, hail, or snow. The strong winds accompanied by rain is called a storm. In hot, humid, and tropical regions like India, storms are more frequent. Under certain conditions, warm air rises to great heights that the low temperature there converts water droplets into ice particles. Strong winds blowing upwards and downwards (Fig. 6.15) facilitate rubbing between water droplets Fig. 6.15: Strong winds going up and down Warm air Cool air"}
{"id": "class 8__science__p111__c1", "text": "Chapter 6 — Pressure, Winds, Storms, and Cyclones 91 Fig. 6.17: Safe position during lightning and ice particles. You have learnt in the chapter ‘Exploring Forces’ that when two objects are rubbed against each other, they get charged. In this case, strong winds blowing upwards and downwards and rubbing against each other cause static electric charges to develop within the clouds. The positively charged lighter ice particles move upwards and occupy the upper part of the clouds. The negatively charged heavier water droplets occupy the lower part of the clouds. Thus, a charge separation within the cloud takes place. Also, when the negatively charged lower part of the cloud moves closer to the ground, it causes the ground and nearby objects, such as trees or buildings, to become positively charged (Fig. 6.16). Normally, air acts as an electrical insulator and does not let opposite charges meet. But when the build up of charges becomes very large, the insulating property of air breaks down. A sudden flow of charges takes place, producing a bright flash of light called lightning. Lightning can occur as opposite charges collide within a cloud, between clouds, or between clouds and the ground. Lightning rapidly heats up the air around it, causing the air to expand and produce a loud sound known as thunder. A storm accompanied by lightning and thunder is called a thunderstorm. A step further Isolated and localised thunderstorms can sometimes occur in various regions of India. These thunderstorms are known by various names such as Kalboishakhi in West Bengal, Bihar, and Jharkhand and Bordoisila in Assam. They occur before the arrival of the monsoon, thereby helping kharif crops to grow. In Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu, they are known as mango showers as they support the ripening of mangoes. Local thunderstorms in Karnataka help in the growth of coffee plants. Lightning can be dangerous! It can ignite fires, damage buildings, and cause severe burns or death in humans and animals.

The rod provides easy path for the transfer of electric charges into the ground. Lightning conductor Fig. 6.18: A lightning conductor 6.6 Cyclone Cyclones are large storms that form over warm ocean waters. As the ocean water gets heated, the warm and moist air above it rises. As the moist air rises, the water vapour condenses to form raindrops. We know that during evaporation, water takes up heat to change into vapour. When this water vapour condenses into raindrops, heat is released back into the atmosphere. This causes further warming of the ascending air leading it to rise even further, creating an even lower pressure. Air from the surrounding regions rushes in and it also starts rising. Earth’s rotation causes the moving air to spin (Fig. 6.19). This cycle is repeated, resulting in the creation of a very low-pressure area with high-speed winds revolving around it. This spinning system of clouds, winds, and rain is called a cyclone. In a cyclone, the region of lowest pressure is at the centre, known as the eye of the cyclone. At the eye of the cyclone, the wind is calm, but the surrounding region experiences strong winds and heavy rainfall. As a cyclone moves from the ocean towards the land, it generates higher wind speeds compared to the wind speeds produced by regular thunderstorms. Once the cyclone reaches land, the source of moist air is cut off and it gradually loses its strength.

Cyclones can be extremely destructive. For example, the Amphan cyclone in 2020 had peak wind speeds of 270 km/h. Strong winds during a cyclone push ocean water towards the shore, creating a wall of water that can be as high as 3–12 metres. This surge of water can flood coastal areas and even areas far from the sea. The heavy rainfall which accompanies a cyclone may cause rivers to overflow and can also trigger landslides. Seawater that rushes inland can contaminate drinking water sources and damage farmland. The salt in seawater can make soil less fertile, affecting crops. Roads may get blocked due to fallen trees and debris, making it difficult for help to reach the affected areas. Power outages can last for days, disrupting emergency services and daily life. How can we protect ourselves during cyclones? It is important to stay updated on weather reports and periodic alerts, and warnings issued by the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Thanks to the weather monitoring satellites, today we can track cyclones and predict their path, helping us reduce their impact on life and property. Several national and international organisations work together to monitor cyclone-related disasters. If you live in a cyclone-prone area, keep an emergency kit ready with essential items. During a cyclone, quickly move to a nearby designated cyclone shelter. Let us wrap up! Cool air rushes to occupy the low-pressure area. Warm air rises, creating a low-pressure area. Warm air rises, cools, and the water vapour condenses to form clouds. Bigger water drops in the clouds fall to the ground as rain, hail, or snow. Positive and negative charges are created in the clouds by strong winds blowing upwards and downwards. Under certain weather conditions, storms may develop into cyclones. When positive and negative charges meet, they cause lightning. Lightning may occur within a cloud, between clouds, or between a cloud and the ground."}

As the rivers flow, they continue to break down the rocks further into pebbles, stones, sand; and transport large quantities of them to the plains. The bigger rocks are eventually broken down into finer grains of sand and clay. Is this grain the smallest unit of a bigger rock or can these grains of sand and clay be broken down further?

The tiny units obtained at this stage are the basic building blocks that the chalk was made up of. This means that one whole piece of chalk was made up of a large number of smaller units. These units are called constituent particles of chalk. A constituent particle is the basic unit that makes up a larger piece of a substance or material. Just like chalk, the grains of sand and clay are not the smallest units of bigger rocks. These are also made up of a large number of their constituent particles. Let us explore further!

These particles are so small that they cannot be seen even through an ordinary microscope. But, where did the sugar go? The tiny sugar particles separate and occupy the available spaces between the water particles. These spaces between the particles are known as interparticle spaces. Chalk and sugar can both be broken down into their constituent particles. But how are the constituent particles held together to form the solid pieces we see? 7.2 What Decides Different States of Matter? The constituent particles of matter are held together through forces which are attractive in nature. These forces are called interparticle attractions. The strength of these attractions depends on the nature of the substance and the interparticle distance. Even a slight increase in the distance decreases the interparticle forces drastically. The strength of these forces ultimately decides the physical state of the substances. Do you know that since ancient times, people have been thinking about how far things could be broken down and what is matter made up of?

You must have noticed that all these objects are solids. They have a definite shape and volume. This is due to the fact that in solids, the particles are tightly packed and the interparticle attractions are very strong. These strong forces of attraction hold the particles in fixed positions, preventing them from moving freely (Fig. 7.4a). The particles can only move to and fro about their positions (vibrate or oscillate) but cannot move past each other. When solids are heated, their particles vibrate more vigorously (Fig. 7.4b). A stage is reached when these vibrations become so vigorous that the particles start leaving their position. The interparticle forces of attraction get weakened and the solid gets converted into the liquid state (Fig. 7.4c). The temperature at which this happens is the melting point of the solid. Fig. 7.4: Magnified schematic pictures of melting of a solid (b) Particles with increased vibrations (a) Solid (c) Liquid Stone Piece of aluminium Rock salt Key Iron nail Wooden block Fig. 7.3: Some solid objects In the solid state, is there any way to move these particles apart?"}

You will notice that the water takes the shape of the container into which it is poured. So, we can say that the liquids do not have a fixed shape and take the shape of the container they are kept in. This happens because the particles of liquids are free to move. In all three containers, the water level remains at 200 mL and no change in volume is observed. Hence, we can say that liquids have a definite volume. However, if a container is not clean, some water may stick to its walls, causing the water level in the next container to be slightly less than 200 mL after pouring. Activity 7.4 shows that the particles of liquids can move freely, but only within a limited space. Therefore, we can infer that liquids have no fixed shape but have a fixed volume. Let us now compare interparticle forces of attraction in liquids and solids. Take some water in a shallow vessel and try to move your finger through it (Fig. 7.6).

When you try this, you are temporarily displacing water. As soon as you remove your finger, the position of the water is restored. We can say that in liquids, the interparticle attractions are slightly weaker than in solids, but still strong enough to keep the particles close together. Recall Curiosity, Grade 6 chapter ‘Temperature and Its Measurement’, where you observed the temperature of boiling water (liquid). When a liquid is heated, a stage comes when it starts boiling. The temperature at which a liquid boils and turns into vapour at atmospheric pressure is called its boiling point. The movement of particles becomes so vigorous that they move apart from each other, resulting in a decrease in the interparticle forces of attraction. Eventually, the constituent particles can escape from the liquid state. The liquid is converted into vapour or the gaseous state. At the boiling point, the formation of vapour is very fast and occurs not only at the surface but also within the liquid. This process is observed as bubble formation in the liquid. However, vapour formation occurs at all temperatures, even below the boiling point, though slowly and only at the surface. This slower process is known as evaporation — about which you have learnt in earlier grades. 7.2.3 Gaseous state Do gases also have a fixed volume?

As a result, gases do not have a fixed shape or volume. In this activity, smoke is used to represent the gaseous state. The tiny particles of smoke suspended in the air are constantly hit by invisible particles of gases, and their movement helps us observe the motion of gas particles. This activity can also be demonstrated by using iodine vapour instead of smoke from incense sticks. Iodine vapour can be obtained by placing some solid iodine in a closed gas jar for some time, as shown in Fig. 7.8. Both liquids and gases flow and do not retain a fixed shape.

When you compress the air by pushing the plunger, the particles are forced to come closer.

You learnt earlier that the constituent particles in solids are held together by strong forces of attraction. So, these particles do not move from one place to another and are closely packed. However, despite close packing, some space is left between the particles as shown in Fig. 7.12a. You might assume that the space between particles is filled with air, but this is not the case. They contain nothing at all. Fig. 7.12 summarises the packing of particles and the interparticle spacing in the three states of matter. A step further Often, we use the term ‘particle’ in different contexts. The meaning of this term changes with the context. For example, while talking about air pollution, the term Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) is used. This term refers to the tiny dust particles suspended in air and not the constituent particles of matter which are extremely small as compared to the dust particles. In fact, even these tiny dust particles are also made up of a very large number of constituent particles, i.e, atoms and molecules. 7.4 \u0007How Particles Move in Different States of Matter?

This happens because the water particles are in constant motion. First they pull out the particles of potassium permanganate from its grain, and later they hit these particles so that they get spread throughout the liquid. In the case of many substances, the constituent particles are held together strongly that the water particles are unable to pull these out. Such substances, like sand, are insoluble in water. Think like a scientist Try it yourself!  Take three clean glass tumblers.  Pour hot water in one of them, water at room temperature in the second and ice-cold water in the third.  Drop a small grain of potassium permanganate into each of them.  Watch carefully and compare.

Hence, the movement of particles increases when heat is provided. Try to depict it by drawing a diagram. How can we demonstrate the movement of gas particles that cannot be seen with the naked eye?

{"id": "class 8__science__p132__c1", "text": "112 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 Based on our learnings from the chapter, we can say that matter is made up of small particles which are held together by the force of attraction. The strength of attractive forces between particles depends on the distance between them, which in turn depends on their thermal (heat) energy. Thus, it is the thermal energy of the particles that determines the physical state of matter. In the solid state, the thermal energy of particles is low, so they remain close to each other and experience strong interparticle attractive forces. This restricts their motion to only small vibrations. At the melting point, the thermal energy is used to overcome the attractive forces between particles, allowing the solid to change into a liquid. At this stage, the particles can move away from their fixed positions. The interparticle distance increases slightly, reducing the strength of the attractive forces to a level that allows the particles to move around, though still within a limited space. In the gaseous state, the particles have enough energy to overcome the forces of attraction between them and move freely in all directions. You will learn more about these particles that constitute matter in higher grades. Let us wrap up!

Snapshots  Matter is composed of extremely small particles.  The particles are held together by interparticle forces of attractions.  The interparticle attractions are the strongest in solids, a little weaker in liquids, and the weakest in gases.  Solids have a fixed shape and size due to strong interparticle attraction, minimum interparticle space, and no free movement of the constituent particles.  The interparticle attraction in liquids is slightly weaker than in solids, enabling the particles to move within a particular space and providing them with a little more interparticle spacing. Therefore, liquids have a definite volume but no fixed shape.  The interparticle attractions in gases are negligible, making their particles completely free to move from one place to another and resulting in maximum interparticle space.

The staircase you use, the air you breathe, the water in your bottle, the food in your lunch box, the clothes and shoes you wear, the book you read, the trees outside, the ball you play with and even the stick you carry — all of these are examples of matter, which you have learnt in earlier grades. You have also learnt that all these things are made up of tiny particles. Most of the things around us are not made of just one substance; rather they are made up of two or more substances mixed together. Let us now understand how different substances come together to form mixtures. 8.1 What Are Mixtures? Have you ever wondered what makes your poha (Fig. 8.1) so delicious or how to make the perfect sprout salad? While these dishes may seem very different, they share something in common—they are both made by mixing several ingredients. We observe the mixing of substances in everyday life. Sugar dissolved in water is also a mixture, and so are soups and lemonade. When two or more substances are mixed, where each substance retains its properties, it is called a mixture. The individual substances that make up a mixture are called its components. The components of a mixture do not react chemically with each other. In some mixtures, the components — like green gram, chickpeas, onion, and tomato in a sprout salad (Fig. 8.2), are easy to see. Such mixtures, where the different components are generally visible with the naked eye or with a magnifying device, are non-uniform in nature. Can you identify a few more examples of non-uniform mixtures around you? On the other hand, some mixtures have components that cannot be seen separately even with the help of a microscope. For example, sugar and water particles cannot be seen separately in their mixture. Such types of mixtures, where the components are evenly distributed and cannot be distinguished, are uniform in nature (Fig. 8.3). Can you list a few uniform mixtures?

{"id": "class 8__science__p138__c1", "text": "118 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 Mishraloha was the name given to the mixture of two or more metals that had properties distinct from its constituent metals. Ancient Indian texts, such as the Charaka Samhita, Susruta Samhita, Rasaratna Samucchaya, Rasa Jala Nidhi, etc., mention the use of alloys for medicinal purposes. For example, Bronze, also known as Kamsya, is an alloy made up of Copper (Tamra, 4 parts) and Tin (Vanga, 1 part), was used to improve digestion and boost immunity. Our scientific heritage 8.1.1 Is air a mixture? In Curiosity, Grade 6, you learnt about air and its composition in the chapter ‘Nature’s Treasures’. Is air a mixture? What kind of mixture is it? You have learnt that air is a uniform mixture of mainly nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, and water vapour. Out of these, oxygen is required by most of the living beings to stay alive. It also helps in combustion. Nitrogen, which constitutes about 78% of the air, does not take part in combustion. We also learnt that air has water vapour in it. When warm air touches a cool surface, the water vapour turns into liquid water, forming tiny droplets. Recall the experiment where you tested the presence of carbon dioxide in the air that we exhale. Let us confirm the presence of carbon dioxide in the air. Activity 8.1: Let us experiment z Take a glass tumbler and fill it half with water. z Add a small amount of calcium oxide (quick lime) slowly to it. z What do you observe? z Calcium oxide reacts vigorously with water to form calcium hydroxide and releases heat. Safety first Perform this step carefully. A step further Do you know that stainless steel is also a mixture? Stainless steel contains iron, nickel, chromium, and a small amount of carbon. They are mixed so uniformly that the entire mixture appears the same throughout and one cannot see the individual substances. Such mixtures are known as alloys. Brass, a mixture of copper and zinc, and bronze, a mixture of copper and tin, are some other examples of alloys (Fig. 8.4). Fig. 8.4: Utensils made of stainless steel, brass, and bronze"}

Can you explain why the solution has turned milky? You know that lime water turns milky when carbon dioxide reacts with calcium hydroxide to form calcium carbonate (insoluble tiny white particles) and water (Fig. 8.5). Since lime water turns milky when exposed to air, this activity demonstrates the presence of carbon dioxide in the air. Calcium hydroxide + Carbon dioxide Calcium carbonate + Water Apart from gases, have you ever observed anything else present in the air? Have you ever noticed tiny shining particles moving in a beam of sunlight entering a dark room through a small opening? What are these particles?

The components of a mixture may themselves be mixtures, as in poha and sprout salad, or pure substances like sugar or common salt dissolved in water. However, in science, all the components of a mixture must be pure substances only. Mixtures could be of several types depending on the physical state of their components.

Have you ever noticed the word ‘pure’ written on the packs of some consumables, such as milk, ghee, and spices (Fig. 8.7)? The word ‘pure’ has slightly different meanings in common usage and in science. In common usage, ‘pure’ means unadulterated products. Adulteration is an illegal process of adding substances which are cheaper, or of a poor quality, to a product. This is usually done to increase the quantity or reduce the manufacturing cost. However, it deteriorates the quality of the product. It can also make the product hazardous to health. Fig. 8.7: Some consumable items"}

For a scientist, even these products that look pure can be considered impure if they are made of more than one substance. A pure substance is a kind of matter that cannot be separated into other kinds of matter by any physical process. When a scientist says that something is pure, it means that the substance consists of the same type of particles. A step further According to science, how would you classify milk, packed fruit juice, baking soda, sugar, and soil — as mixtures or pure substances? 8.3 What Are the Types of Pure Substances? Recall the different states of water that you studied in Curiosity, Grade 6. What happened when water was cooled or heated? We observed that on cooling water gets converted into ice, and on boiling it gets converted into vapour. We can get back water up on heating ice or cooling water vapour. It shows that during these processes, the particles of water remain the same. Now, let us perform another activity in which we pass electricity through water and observe its effect.

Water Hydrogen + Oxygen￼ 8.3.1 Elements The two substances hydrogen and oxygen formed in Activity 8.3, are pure substances and are termed as elements. Each element is made up of identical particles called atoms. These particles are different from the particles of any other element. Elements are substances that cannot be further broken down into simpler substances. They are the building blocks of all matter. Some other examples of elements are gold, silver, sulfur, carbon, etc. The atoms of most of the elements cannot exist independently. Two or more such atoms combine and form a stable particle of that element called a molecule. For example, two atoms of hydrogen combine to form one molecule of hydrogen. Similarly, two atoms of oxygen combine to form one molecule of oxygen (Fig. 8.10). A step further Elements can be classified into metals and non-metals. You have already studied that gold, silver, magnesium, iron, and aluminium are metals, whereas carbon, sulfur, hydrogen, and oxygen are non-metals. Isn't it interesting to know that some elements like silicon and boron have intermediate properties between those of metals and non-metals? They are called metalloids, about which you will learn in higher grades.  The number of elements known at present is 118, and most of them exist in a solid state.  Eleven elements exist in a gaseous state at room temperature, all of which are non-metals like oxygen, helium, nitrogen, etc.  Only two elements are liquid at room temperature—mercury, which is a metal and bromine, which is a non-metal.  Although gallium and caesium are solid elements, they become liquid at a temperature around 30 °C (303 K) and turn into liquid.

{"id": "class 8__science__p144__c1", "text": "124 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 8.3.2 Compounds Why cannot we separate hydrogen and oxygen present in water by physical means? In water, the particles of hydrogen and oxygen are so tightly attached to each other that it is generally impossible to separate them apart using physical methods. That is why water is a compound. Compounds are formed when different elements combine in fixed ratios to form something entirely new. The properties of compounds are different from those of elements forming that compound. The constituent elements of a compound cannot be separated by any physical method. From Activity 8.3, we find that molecules of water are made of two different elements: hydrogen and oxygen (Fig. 8.11), combined chemically in a fixed ratio. The ratio of the number of atoms of hydrogen to oxygen in water has been found to be 2:1. Are common salt and sugar elements or compounds? Let us find out. Sodium, a soft metal, and chlorine, a hazardous gas, combine to form a harmless yet taste-enhancing substance that is essential for our lives. This substance is known as sodium chloride, which is made up of particles of sodium and chlorine in a 1:1 ratio. We learnt that dissolved sodium chloride (common salt) may be separated from water by the physical process of evaporation. Is it possible to separate sodium chloride into its elements by physical processes? Let us now explore if we can separate the elements in sugar! Activity 8.4: Let us experiment z Put a teaspoon of sugar in a boiling tube. z Heat it gently as shown in Fig. 8.12a. z What do you observe? Oh!

Later, it begins to char, i.e., it turns blackish (Fig. 8.12c). You will find small droplets of water inside the boiling tube near its open end. Where did this water come from? Was it in the dry sugar, or did it come by the condensation of water vapour in the air? Since we are heating the tube, the water must have come from the dry sugar and not from the air. Can you predict what is left behind? Charcoal (carbon) is left behind in the boiling tube. You can scoop it out in a watch glass (Fig. 8.12c) and explore if it burns like coal. Sugar decomposes on heating and gives carbon and water. As you know, water consists of hydrogen and oxygen. Hence, sugar cannot be an element. It may be stated that sugar is a chemical compound consisting of the elements carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Let us explore more about compounds.

Sample A: We can say that Sample A is a mixture of the two elements—iron and sulfur. Its components retain their properties, and their black and yellow coloured particles can be seen. On bringing magnet near Sample A, the iron filings get attracted towards the magnet. Hence, iron and sulfur can be separated. You might have observed that in Sample A, iron in the mixture reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid to form iron chloride and hydrogen gas. The gas is colourless, has no smell, and burns with a ‘pop’ sound. The reaction can be represented as — Iron + Dilute Hydrochloric acid Iron chloride + Hydrogen gas Sulfur on the other hand, is left as a yellow solid at the bottom of the test tube. This shows that sulfur does not react with hydrochloric acid.￼ Sample B: The black mass obtained in Sample B is iron sulfide. We observe that the texture and the colour are the same throughout. It is formed by heating the two elements, iron and sulfur. It is not attracted by a magnet. The new substance has completely different properties, and iron and sulfur can no longer be separated. Hence, we can say that a compound has been formed. Can you explain now why the magnet has no effect on Sample B?

Elements like iron and aluminium are used to construct bridges, buildings, and vehicles. Understanding these concepts is not just about recognising what surrounds us; it is also the key to innovation. For instance, chemists study how elements combine to create compounds, enabling them to invent life-saving medicines and vaccines to fight diseases. This knowledge also helps in the creation of fertilisers thereby enhancing crop production that feeds the ever-increasing human population globally. Engineers and material scientists rely on their understanding of compounds and mixtures to design materials with unique properties. For example, they have developed alloys like stainless steel, which is stronger and more durable than pure iron. Wood, steel, and concrete, which are used as building materials, are all mixtures. You learnt that various metals are obtained from minerals. Let us learn about these minerals. An example of a ‘wonder’ material developed by material scientists is graphene aerogel. This is made from carbon and is said to be the lightest material on earth. It is so light that even grass can hold it (Fig. 8.21). It is highly porous and therefore, has a high absorbing capacity. For this reason, it can potentially be used as an environmental cleaner, for example, to clean up oil spills in both seas and on land. It is useful in fabricating energy-saving devices and special coatings for buildings. Fig. 8.21 A step further 8.5 What Are Minerals? Most rocks are a mixture of minerals, which can be viewed with the eyes, or by using a magnifying glass or a microscope. Some of the minerals are called native minerals, which are pure elements and not compounds. These can be metals, such as gold, silver, copper, etc., or non-metals like sulfur, carbon, etc. Most of the minerals are compounds made up of more than one element. Some common examples of minerals include quartz, calcite, mica, pyroxene, and olivine (Fig. 8.22). Many things that we use in our everyday life are made up of minerals or elements extracted from minerals. For example, cement is made from calcite, quartz, alumina, and iron oxide, which are minerals or are obtained from minerals. Talcum powder is made from the mineral talc.

ORS is used to treat dehydration by keeping your body hydrated. You have learnt to prepare ORS at home in Curiosity, Grade 6. You may have wondered why every sip of your homemade ORS tastes the same, no matter how much you drink. Why does it not taste salty in one sip and sweet in another? This is because when you add sugar and salt to water, they form a mixture in which the components are evenly distributed throughout. Can you predict whether this mixture is uniform or not (Fig. 9.1)? What happens when chalk powder is mixed with water—does it form a uniform mixture? When salt and sugar are mixed with water, a uniform mixture is formed, whereas when chalk powder or sand, or sawdust is mixed with water, the components are not evenly distributed. Such mixtures are known as non-uniform mixtures (Fig. 9.2a and 9.2b). Let us explore the science of mixing things together. 9.1 What Are Solute, Solvent, and Solution? A uniform mixture, such as that of salt or sugar, and water, is called a solution. Whenever a solid is mixed with a liquid to form a solution, the solid component is called the solute, and the liquid component is called the solvent. The solute dissolves in the solvent to form a solution (Fig. 9.3). Solute + Solvent Solution When a solution is formed by mixing two liquids, it is not always clear which substance is dissolving the other. In such cases, the substance present in smaller amount is called the solute, while the one in larger amount is called the solvent. We know air is a mixture. Would a mixture of gases also be considered a solution? Just as water can act as a solvent in liquid solutions, gases can also form solution — with air being a common example. Air is a gaseous solution. Since nitrogen is present in the largest amount in the air, it is considered as the solvent, while oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, and other gases are considered as solutes.

After adding a few more spoons of salt, a stage comes when the added salt does not dissolve completely and the undissolved salt settles at the bottom. This indicates that the water can no longer dissolve any more salt because it has reached its limit. The solution in which more solute can be dissolved at a given temperature, is called an unsaturated solution (Fig. 9.5). However, when the solute stops dissolving and begins to settle at the bottom, the solution is called a saturated solution at that particular temperature (Fig. 9.6). The amount of solute present in a fixed quantity of solution (or solvent) is termed as its concentration. Depending upon the amount of solute present in a fixed quantity of solution, it can be called a dilute solution (less amount of solute) or a concentrated solution (more amount of solute). Dilute and concentrated are relative terms. So, one can say in Activity 9.1, the solution obtained by dissolving one spoon of salt is dilute as compared to that obtained by dissolving two or more spoons of salt. Can you now reflect — which solution is more concentrated; 2 spoons of salt in 100 mL of water or 4 spoons of salt in 50 mL of water?

We can also say that a saturated solution at a particular temperature behaves as an unsaturated solution if the temperature is increased.

Oxygen dissolves in water only to a small extent. Even though present in minute quantities, it is this dissolved oxygen that sustains all aquatic life, including plants, fishes, and other organisms. Is the mixture of gases in water a uniform or non-uniform mixture? It is a uniform mixture because the gases dissolve evenly in water to form a solution. Does temperature affect the solubility of gases in liquids also? If so, how? It has been observed that the solubility of gases generally decreases as temperature increases. More oxygen can dissolve in cold water, ensuring sufficient oxygen for aquatic life (Fig. 9.8). On the other hand, when water warms up, the solubility of oxygen decreases. Now I understand that the mixtures we use can be of two types—uniform and non-uniform. Uniform mixtures are called solutions, and their components are not visible separately. In non-uniform mixtures, the components can be seen either with the naked eye or with a magnifying device.

You must have observed that some objects float while others sink in water (Fig. 9.9). You may have noticed that, while washing rice, husk particles present in the rice float on the surface of water while rice sinks to the bottom of the container. Why does this happen? If you add oil to water, it floats on water. Generally, it is believed that objects that float in a liquid are lighter and others that sink are heavier than the liquid. A wooden stick and an iron rod may be of the same size, yet the iron rod feels much heavier. When we say that iron is heavier than wood, we are referring to a special property known as density, which describes the heaviness of an object. Note However, the density of a substance is not the only factor that decides whether it will float or sink in a particular liquid. Let us explore further. 9.5 What Is Density? Imagine a crowded bus where many people are packed together — this is an example of high density whereas, the same bus with only a few people is an example of low density. Similarly, a forest where trees grow close to each other is called a dense forest (Fig. 9.10a), but if the trees are far apart (Fig. 9.10b), it is considered less dense. How do scientists define density? Let us find out. We have learnt that matter is anything that possesses mass and occupies space (volume). Density is defined as the mass present in a unit volume of that substance. The density of a substance may be expressed mathematically using the formula: Density = Mass Volume The density of a substance is independent of its shape or size. However, it is dependent on temperature and pressure. Pressure primarily affects the density of gases, while its effect on solids and liquids is negligible.

What does this tell us about the density of the oil, and is it less or more than that of water? The units in which density is expressed will depend upon the units of mass and volume taken. As you have learnt, the SI units of mass and volume are kilogram (kg) and cubic metre (m3), respectively. Therefore, the SI unit of density is kilogram per cubic metre, abbreviated as kg/m3. In case of liquids, other units of density are also used for convenience, such as gram per millilitre, abbreviated as g/mL and gram per cubic centimetre, abbreviated as g/cm3. Conversion factor for density 1 kg/m3 = 1000 g/m3 = 1000 g/1000 L = 1 g/L = 1 g/1000 mL = 1 g/1000 cm3 The mass of 1 mL of water is close to 1 g at room temperature. For the measurement of the mass of water, we generally consider the volume in mL and its mass in g. Hence, 10 mL of water would be approximately 10 g. Similarly, 100 mL of water would be approximately 100 g. Suppose the mass of an aluminium block is 27 g and its volume is 10 cm3, its density is 2.7 g/cm3. From this, it can be said that aluminium is 2.7 times denser than water. We express this fact by saying that the relative density of aluminium with respect to water is 2.7. It is a number without any units. = Density of that substance Density of water at that temperature Relative density of any substance with respect to water 9.5.1 Determination of density The density of an object can be determined by measuring its mass and volume. How to measure mass? You learnt the term ‘mass’ in Curiosity, Grade 6. Mass is the quantity of matter present in any object. The instrument used to measure the mass of an object is known as a balance. You must have seen various types of balances being used by shopkeepers. Here, we are using a digital weighing balance to measure the mass. You learnt in chapter ‘Exploring Forces’ that on Earth, weight and mass are closely related."}

A step further As mentioned in Chapter 5, the words ‘mass’ and ‘weight’ are often used interchangeably in everyday language. But they have different meanings in science, which can sometimes cause confusion. Mass is the quantity of matter present in an object or a substance. Its units are gram (g) and kilogram (kg). On the other hand, weight is the force by which the Earth attracts an object or a substance towards itself, and it is measured in newtons (N). Most balances (except two-pan balances like in Fig. 9.13) actually measure weight, but their scales are marked in mass units, so they show values in grams or kilograms (Fig. 9.12c).

A tetra pack says it contains 200 mL buttermilk (chach) (Fig. 9.14). What does that mean? You learnt in Curiosity, Grade 6 that volume is the space occupied by an object. You also know that the SI unit of volume is cubic metres, written as m³. It is the volume of a cube whose each side is one metre in length. Volume of smaller objects is conveniently expressed in a decimetre cube (dm3) or centimetre cube (cm3). One centimetre cube is also written as one cc. Volume of liquids is expressed in litres (L) which is equivalent to 1 dm3. A commonly used submultiple of a litre is millilitre (mL) which is equivalent to 1 cm3. One of the common apparatuses used to measure the volume of liquids is a measuring cylinder. It is a narrow transparent cylindrical container with one side open and the other side closed as shown in Fig. 9.15. There are markings on the transparent body of the cylinder that indicate the volume of liquid in the measuring cylinder. We can use it to measure the desired amount of a liquid. Measuring cylinders are available in different sizes to measure volume — 5 mL, 10 mL, 25 mL, 50 mL, 100 mL, 250 mL, etc (Fig. 9.15). How accurately can these measuring cylinders measure?

The smallest volume that the measuring cylinder can read is__________. For the measuring cylinder shown in Fig. 9.16, the volume difference indicated between 10 mL and 20 mL, or between 40 mL and 50 mL, is 10 mL. The number of divisions between these marks is 10. So, one small division can read 10 ÷ 10 = 1 mL. That is, the smallest value that this measuring cylinder can read is 1 mL. The smallest volume that a measuring cylinder can measure depends on the capacity of the measuring cylinder. Usually it is 0.1 mL in smaller measuring cylinders with a capacity of 10 mL or 25 mL, it is 1 mL in a 100 mL measuring cylinder, 2 mL in a 250 mL measuring cylinder, and 5 mL in a 500 mL measuring cylinder. Suppose we want to take 70 mL of water. If we use a 50 mL measuring cylinder, it would not be possible to measure 70 mL of water in one step. First, we have to measure 50 mL water and then 20 mL. Measuring volume in more than one step is not convenient. On the other hand, if a 250 mL or 500 mL measuring cylinder is used, the measurement can be done in one step but the accuracy would be reduced as the smallest volume that these measuring cylinders can measure is greater than that of a 100 mL measuring cylinder.

Did you know that our planet, Earth, is composed of several layers, such as crust, upper mantle, lower mantle, outer core, and inner core, each with its particular range of density? The outermost layer, called the crust, is the lightest and the density of the different layers increases as we move towards the centre (Fig. 9.20). As one moves deeper into the Earth, both the pressure and the temperature rise significantly, making the materials heavier and more compact. Ever heard of ... In ancient times, before large ships were invented, people used bamboo and wooden logs to travel across rivers and seas (Fig. 9.21). Bamboo was used because it is light, hollow, and floats easily on water. People tied bamboo poles together to make rafts and small boats for fishing, trading, and crossing water bodies. Wooden logs, especially from strong trees were either hollowed out to make boats or used as rafts. These simple boats, made from locally available materials, were important for moving around and connecting different places. Even today, similar traditional boats made of bamboo or wood are used in some regions—not just for transport, but also as tourist attractions. Fig. 9.21: Bamboo raft floats on water 9.5.2 Effect of temperature on density Generally, the density of a substance decreases with heating and increases with cooling. This can be explained on the basis of what you have learnt in chapter ‘Particulate Nature of Matter’. As temperature increases, the particles of a substance whether, solid, liquid, or gas, tend to move away and spread. This results in an increase in volume but there is no change in mass. Since the Density = Mass/Volume, upon heating, the volume increases and the density decreases. This explains why hot air moves up as it is less dense than the cool air around it. The hot air balloon works on the same principle (Fig. 9.22). Fig. 9.20: Layers of Earth Crust Upper mantle Lower mantle Outer core (liquid) Inner core (solid) Fig. 9.22: Rising of hot air balloons"}
{"id": "class 8__science__p168__c1", "text": "148 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 9.5.3 Effect of pressure on density Pressure affects density differently depending on the state of matter. For gases, increasing pressure causes the particles to move closer together. As a result, the volume of the gas decreases and its density increases. In the case of liquids, pressure has a small effect because they are nearly incompressible. We have learnt in chapter ‘Particulate Nature of Matter’ that the particles in solids are very close to each other. So, how is the density of solids affected when pressure is applied? Solids are even less affected by pressure than liquids, and changes in their density are usually negligible. Ever heard of ... Why does ice float on water? Ice floats on water because it is lighter than liquid water (Fig. 9.23). Water has a special property that its density is highest at 4 °C. It means water is heaviest at 4 °C. As the temperature drops, and water turns into ice at 0 °C, it undergoes a change in structure—the particles arrange themselves in a way that takes up more space. This process is called expansion. Because the same amount of water now occupies a larger volume, its density decreases. As a result, ice becomes lighter than liquid water and floats on its surface. This is important for animals living in lakes and oceans because ice floats, it forms a layer on top, keeping the water underneath warm enough for fish and other creatures to survive, even in extremely cold weather.

The centre had many fascinating displays on nature, space, and technology. While her parents explored a section on saving water and electricity, Meena and her brother wandered off to look around. In one corner, Meena noticed a row of unusual, curved mirrors. Curious, she stepped closer and looked into one. Her face appeared unusually large, while her brother, standing a little farther away, looked upside down! At another mirror, she saw a tiny version of herself. Meena was puzzled. She remembered doing activities with a mirror earlier where the image formed by the mirror was of the same size as the object and was erect (in the chapter ‘Light: Shadows and Reflections’ in Curiosity, Grade 7). Seeing her confusion, a guide from the science centre walked up to her and smiled. “These are not plane mirrors,” the guide explained. “These are spherical mirrors. When the mirror is curved inward or outward, your image looks different in them!” Meena’s curiosity grew and she decided to talk to her teacher about these spherical mirrors. 10.1 What Are Spherical Mirrors? Activity 10.1: Let us explore z Take a shiny metallic spoon and hold its curved surface close to your face. Can you see your image in it? z Notice the image of your face. Is it different from the image you see in a plane mirror? z While observing the image, slowly move the spoon away from your face. Do you observe any change in the image? z Now flip the spoon and repeat the same steps. Did you notice that the shiny metallic spoon acted like a mirror and you could see your image in it? When you looked at the inner side of the spoon which is curved inwards, you must have observed that the image was inverted (Fig. 10.1a). When you looked at the outer side of the spoon which bulges outwards, the image of your face was erect but smaller in size (Fig. 10.1b). Curved mirrors, like the spoon, can also be specially made. Spherical mirrors are a common type of curved mirrors which are shaped like a part of a hollow glass sphere. Mirrors, whose reflecting surfaces are spherical are called spherical mirrors.

A step further The shape of a spherical mirror is such that it can be thought of as a part of an imaginary hollow sphere. However, remember that spherical mirrors are not made by slicing a hollow glass sphere. Instead, they are created by grinding and polishing a flat glass piece into a curved surface. If a reflective coating (like a thin layer of aluminium) is applied on the outer curved surface, it forms a concave mirror. If the coating is applied on the inner curved surface, it forms a convex mirror.

However, when the object is moved farther away, the image becomes inverted. Initially, the image is enlarged in size and then keeps getting smaller. In case of a convex mirror, the image is always erect and smaller than the object, that is diminished. However, the size of the image decreases slightly as the object is moved away from the convex mirror. This activity shows that spherical mirrors (concave and convex) behave differently from plane mirrors. A plane mirror always forms an erect image of the same size as the object. However, in the concave and convex mirrors, the size of the image changes as the distance of the object from the mirror changes. In addition, in the case of a concave mirror, the image also gets inverted when the object is taken away from the mirror. Lateral inversion of the image is seen in all three types of mirrors. I just got an idea. We can also identify whether a mirror is plane, or concave, or convex by looking at the images of an object formed in them! Yes. But where do we find concave and convex mirrors being used in our surroundings? The reflectors of torches, headlights of cars and scooters are concave in shape (Fig. 10.6a). Have you ever noticed a dental mirror used by a dentist for inspecting teeth? It is a concave mirror which provides an enlarged view of teeth when held close to the teeth inside the mouth (Fig. 10.6b). A step further Do you remember learning about the use of telescope in the chapter ‘Beyond Earth’ in Curiosity, Grade 6? Most modern telescopes are reflecting telescope that use curved mirrors, with the main mirror being a large concave mirror. Look at the side-view mirrors on vehicles. These mirrors are convex. They always form an erect image of the traffic behind and smaller than the actual vehicles. Also, since the convex mirror is Fig. 10.6: Use of concave mirror (a) As a reflector of a torch; (b) By a dentist (b) (a)"}

Convex mirrors are also installed in big stores to monitor a large area to deter thefts. 10.3 What Are the Laws of Reflection? Let us now repeat an activity which we did earlier in grade 7, but this time we will extend it further. Do you remember doing the activity for observing the reflection of a beam of light from a plane mirror? Activity 10.4: Let us experiment We have observed images formed by three types of mirrors — plane, concave, and convex. But are there any laws which govern the image formation?

Place the plane mirror upright on it. z Using the thin slit and torch, obtain a thin beam of light along the paper and adjust it to fall upon the mirror as shown in Fig. 10.8a. z Now, move the slit and torch slightly so that the beam of light falls at a different angle on the mirror (Fig. 10.8b). Does the reflected beam of light also shift? Fig. 10.7: Use of convex mirror as a (a) Side-view mirror; (b) Road safety mirror; (c) Surveillance mirror (b) (c) (a)"}

To understand this better, let us draw this on a paper, step by step. But before doing that, let us learn how to represent light. We often represent light by straight lines with arrows, or rays. Rays indicate the path along which light travels. Do you remember learning earlier that the light travels along a straight line? z Draw a line showing the position of the plane mirror. Also, draw lines with arrows (rays) indicating the beam of light falling on the mirror and the reflected beam of light as shown in Fig. 10.9a. The ray of light that falls on the mirror is called the incident ray. The ray of light that comes back from the mirror is called the reflected ray. z Now remove the mirror. From the point where the incident ray strikes the mirror, draw a line making an angle of 90° to the line representing the mirror. This line is known as the normal to the reflecting surface at the point of incidence, O (Fig. 10.9b). The angle between the normal and the incident ray is called the angle of incidence (i) (Fig. 10.9c). The angle between the normal and the reflected ray is known as the angle of reflection (r) (Fig. 10.9c). z On your drawing, measure the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection and note it in Table 10.1. z Repeat the activity several times by changing the angle of incidence. z Finally, let the incident beam fall on the mirror along the normal and observe the direction of the reflected beam. What would be the angle of incidence and angle of reflection in this case? Both the angles would be zero in this case. S.No. Angle of incidence (i ) Angle of reflection (r ) Table 10.1: Measuring angles of incidence and reflection Do you notice that both angles in Table 10.1 are nearly equal?

Do you still see the reflected beam on the extended portion? z Flatten the paper again and observe. The reflected beam disappears when the sheet is bent but reappears when it is flattened again. This shows that the reflected beam lies in the same plane as that of the incident beam. Bending the sheet creates a new plane, breaking this alignment. The incident ray, the normal to the mirror at the point of incidence, and the reflected ray, all lie in the same plane. This is another law of reflection. A step further In the two cases, even though the directions of incident rays are different, they fall at the same point on the mirror, and thus, the directions of normal are the same.

Observe the reflected beams. Is your observation similar to what is shown in Fig. 10.11 (b), (c), and (d)? When multiple parallel beams of light fall upon a plane mirror, the multiple reflected beams are also parallel (Fig. 10.11b). However, when multiple beams of light fall upon a concave mirror, the multiple reflected beams get closer, that is, they converge (Fig. 10.11c). Whereas, in the case of a convex mirror, the multiple reflected beams spread, that is, they diverge (Fig. 10.11d).

This produces sufficient heat at this point which can ignite the paper. A step further Devices which concentrate sunlight into a small area, using mirrors and lenses, are called solar concentrators. The concentrated sunlight is used to heat a liquid to produce steam which can be used to generate electricity or for providing heat for various purposes, such as large scale cooking or for solar furnaces.

The bright portion continues to shrink for another week until it is no longer visible. This two-week period is called the waning period of the Moon. Different names are given to the Moon’s visible shapes during this cycle (Fig. 11.2).

In India, the waning period of the Moon is generally called the Krishna Paksha, while the waxing period is called the Shukla Paksha. The Moon goes through a waning period followed by a waxing period in a cyclical manner as shown in Fig. 11.2. The cycle from one full Moon to the next takes about a month. The changing shapes of the bright portion of the Moon from one day to another as seen from the Earth are called the phases of the Moon. 11.1.2 Locating the Moon When you checked the Moon at the same time on successive days (for example, at sunrise), did you see it in a different part of the sky? On a full Moon day, the Moon is nearly opposite the Sun — when the Sun rises in the East, the Moon is almost setting in the West. On subsequent mornings at sunrise, as its bright part continues to decrease, the Moon appears to move closer in the sky to the Sun. When the bright part of the Moon decreases to a half circle shape, the Moon is overhead at Sunrise. A few days later, the crescent Moon appears even closer to the Sun. Knowing the phase of the Moon and whether it is waxing or waning can thus help us find out where and when to look for the Moon on any given day. A waxing Moon is easiest to spot at sunset, and a waning Moon at sunrise. Because of these shifts, the Moon always rises and sets at different times than the Sun. A step further Many people believe the Moon rises when the Sun sets, but that is not always true. Look in a local newspaper or on the Positional Astronomy Centre (India Meteorological Department) website to find the moonrise time in your area. Check these times for several days in a row and you will see that the Moon rises about 50 minutes later each day. Sometimes moonrise happens in the afternoon (around 2:00 – 4:00 p.m.), so you can spot the Moon in the eastern sky during daylight. You may need to wait about 30 minutes past the listed moonrise time for the Moon to climb high enough for it to be seen. The time and position of moonrise changes from one day to the next. 7 April 2025 14:23 8 April 2025 15:17"}

You may recall learning earlier that the Moon does not emit light of its own, but shines because it reflects sunlight that falls on it. The half of the Moon that faces the Sun receives sunlight and becomes illuminated (Fig. 11.3). The other half facing away from the Sun does not receive sunlight and remains non-illuminated. The Moon revolves around the Earth and, only one half of the Moon always faces the Earth. However, the portion of the Moon facing the Earth is not always its illuminated part. We can only see the illuminated portion of the Moon from Earth. Sometimes, the entire illuminated portion of the Moon faces the Earth, and at other times only a part of it. At such times the illuminated portion of the Moon that we see is not a full circle. On New Moon day, we do not see the illuminated portion of the Moon at all, as only the non-illuminated portion of the Moon faces the Earth. Therefore, the Moon appears different on different days. Let us do an activity to understand how the illuminated portion of the Moon, as seen by us, changes when its position changes with respect to the Sun.

This happens because, as shown in Fig. 11.6, the Moon moves ahead in its orbit while the Earth completes one rotation about its axis in 24 hours. Earth needs to rotate some more for the Moon to appear in nearly the same spot in the sky. A step further The Moon phases do not happen due to Earth’s shadow. It is an incorrect explanation for the Moon’s phases that Earth’s shadow falls on it. As we have learnt, the phases of the Moon occur due to the relative change in orientation of the Sun, Moon, and Earth as the Moon revolves around the Earth. The Earth’s shadow on the Moon causes a lunar eclipse, not the Moon’s phases as we learnt earlier (in chapter ‘Earth, Moon and the Sun’ in the Curiosity, Grade 7). Lunar eclipses can only happen on a full Moon day and solar eclipses can happen only on a new Moon day. But they do not occur every month because of the small tilt of the Moon’s orbit with respect to the Earth’s orbit around the Sun.

We have learnt earlier that when viewed from the Earth, the Sun appears to rise in the eastward direction, set in the westward direction every day, and rise again the next day. This apparent periodic motion of the Sun seen by us is primarily due to the rotation of the Earth around its own axis. This natural cycle of the Sun due to the rotation of the Earth, is the foundation of the day, a unit to measure time. The average time that the Sun takes to go from its highest position in the sky on one day to the highest position in the sky the next day, is 24 hours, and is called the mean solar day. The highest position of the Sun in the sky can be found by measuring the length of the shadows cast by an object during the day. The shadow is shortest when the Sun is at the highest point in the sky. Activity 11.3: Let us measure a day! z Find a small flat area in a ground which receives sunlight during the day. Fix a 1 m stick vertically in it as shown in Fig. 11.7. z Start observing at 11:00 a.m. Every minute, mark a dot on the ground at the tip of the stick’s shadow. Keep marking dots until around 1:10 p.m. z Identify when the shadow was shortest and find out its time by counting the number of dots. Record this time in Table 11.2. Repeat this exercise for the next few days. z Find the duration of the solar day by finding a difference in time on two consecutive days as shown in Table 11.1. So, changing phases of the Moon is a natural periodic event, with a cycle of almost a month, which can also be used for time keeping. Yes, along with the natural periodic events of day and night and the changing seasons about which we learnt earlier. But how are these periodic events used for keeping time?

Is it nearly equal to 24 hours? The phases of the Moon give us another natural cycle with a duration that is longer than a day. The Moon takes about 29.5 days (nearly a month) to cycle through all its phases. The cycle of the phases of the Moon is the basis for a month, another unit to measure time (Fig. 11.8). The next larger unit to measure time is related to the natural cycle of seasons. Do you remember learning earlier that the Earth revolves around the Sun and takes nearly 365 and a quarter days to complete one revolution around the Sun? The Earth undergoes one cycle of seasons during this time, which can be used to define a solar year (Fig. 11.8). 11.2.1 Lunar calendars In ancient times, people had noticed that during one cycle of seasons, one can fit nearly 12 cycles of the phases of the moon, that is, 12 lunar months. This is how lunar calendars came into being, with the day as the shortest unit, a month of nearly 29.5 days, and a lunar year consisting of 12 lunar months. The phases of the Moon thus gave an easy and a perfectly sound way to track the passage of time. However, in a lunar calendar the seasons do not remain synchronised to the same lunar months in successive lunar years. The reason is that the seasons repeat in approximately 365 days while the lunar year is 354 days long. Fig. 11.8: The Earth goes around the Sun, and the Moon revolves around the Earth in regular intervals of time. Cycle of Earth’s seasons due to its revolution around the Sun define a year Cycle of Moon’s phases due to its revolution around the Earth defines a month Cycle of Sun returning to its highest position in the sky due to Earth’s rotation defines a day"}
{"id": "class 8__science__p200__c1", "text": "180 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 11.2.2 Solar calendars It was important to know the arrival of seasons for agricultural purposes. This need for a year to synchronise with seasons led to the creation of solar calendars. The Gregorian calendar, widely used today, is a solar calendar. The months in solar calendars are adjusted to add up to 365 days. That is why in Gregorian calendars, some months have 30 days, others 31, and February has only 28 days. On top of the 365 days, the Earth takes nearly an extra quarter of a day to complete one revolution around the Sun. These extra hours add up to approximately one day every four years. To adjust for this, solar calendars add an extra day every four years using the concept of a leap year. In the Gregorian calendar, if a year is divisible by four, then an extra leap day is added. So in a leap year, February has 29 days, which keeps the calendar well synchronised with the seasons. A step further The Earth takes slightly less time than 365 and a quarter day to go from one spring equinox to the next spring equinox. Adding a day every four years helps to synchronise with the seasons, but it actually adds a little too much over time. To fix this, leap years are skipped every 100 years—like in 1700, 1800, and 1900. But skipping all of them would make the calendar lag slightly behind. So every 400 years, a leap year is again added back—like in 1600 and 2000. These careful corrections keep the calendar closely matched with the seasons over long periods of time! A step further As we learnt earlier, seasons are caused by the Earth’s revolution around the Sun and its movement from the spring equinox to winter equinox and back. The time between successive spring equinoxes is called the tropical year. Gregorian calendar is based upon tropical year. We have also learnt earlier that the stars that rise at sunset change throughout the year due to the Earth’s revolution around the Sun. The time duration required for the same stars to rise again at sunset is called the sidereal year, and it can also be used to define a solar calendar. The sidereal year is longer than the tropical year by a mere 20 minutes, and so it takes a long time before the differences between the two calendars become noticeable. In modern times, astronomers use the sidereal year to keep track of the Earth’s position in its orbit around the Sun."}

The 12 lunar months add up to 354 days and thus fall short by nearly 11 days compared to the solar year. Thus every 2–3 years, Our scientific heritage For thousands of years, people — including those in India — have been observing the sky and developing calendars. People in ancient times did not know that Earth revolves around the Sun, and lacked modern instruments. Yet through years of careful sky observations, they noticed patterns and cycles in natural events. Hence, they could determine that the length of the year was approximately 365 days allowing them to create calendars. For example, careful observation reveals that the Sun does not always rise exactly in the East. In summer, it rises a little northward of East and in winter a little southward of East. These extremes happen on the solstices, around June 21 and December 21 each year. The Sun’s apparent northward movement from December to June is called Uttarayan, and its apparent southward movement from June to December is Dakshinayan. This cycle repeats every year and is closely linked to the changing seasons. The Taittirīya Saṁhitā records it in the verse 6.5.3: तस्‍‍माादाादि�त्‍‍य: षण्माासाा दक्षिि±णेनैति� षडुत्तरेण । “Thus the Sun moves southwards for six months and northwards for six months.” In the past, the equinoxes and solstices were also tracked by identifying the stars that rose at sunset. Ancient Indian texts like the Surya Siddhanta noted that the pattern of stars, Capricorn (called Makar in India), would be in the background of the Sun around the winter solstice during those ancient times. भाानोोर्मकरसंंस्‍ङ््क्राान्तेःः3 षण्माासाा उत्तराायणम्् । कर्क्‍का��ा�देस्तुु तथैव स्याात् षण्माासाा दक्षिि±णाायनम्् ।।9।। Translation: From the moment of the Sun’s entrance into the constellation of Capricorn, six months make up its northward progress (Uttarayana), so likewise from the moment of entrance into the constellation of Cancer, six months are its southward progress (Dakshinayana). Over the years, different types of calendars have evolved based on specific needs. A number of these calendars are used in different parts of India to track time and celebrating festivals.

The year begins on 22 March, which is the day after the spring equinox. Unlike the Gregorian calendar, months in the Indian National Calendar have either 30 or 31 days. The names of these months were taken from traditional Indian calendars. In a regular year, the second to sixth months have 31 days and the rest have 30 days. The leap years are matched to the Gregorian calendar by adding a day to Chaitra, the first month of the year. In such years, the new year begins on 21 March of the Gregorian calendar."}

In 1952, the Government of India set up a Calendar Reform Committee (CRC) to examine all existing calendars which were being followed in the country at that time and to recommend an accurate and uniform calendar for the whole of India. The CRC recommended ‘Unified National Calendar’ was adopted for use with effect from 21 March 1956 CE, that is, 1 Chaitra 1878 Saka. The Indian National Calendar follows the general principles as that of the Surya Siddhanta. Be a scientist Meghnad Saha (1893 –1956) Meghnad Saha was a pioneering astrophysicist of India who studied stars and their temperatures and developed a mathematical equation, famously known as the Saha equation. The Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, in Kolkata, is named after him. He was also the chairperson of the Calendar Reform Committee. 11.3 \u0007Are Festivals Related to Astronomical Phenomena? Many Indian festivals are tied to the phases of the Moon and hence are based on either lunar or luni-solar calendars. For instance, Diwali falls on the new Moon of the month of Kartika, Holi on the full Moon of Phalguna, Buddha Purnima on the full Moon of Vaisakha, Eid-ul-Fitr is celebrated after sighting the crescent Moon at the end of the month of Ramazan, while Dussehra is celebrated on the tenth day in the month of Ashwina. Hence, they occur on different dates in the Gregorian calendar in successive years. For festivals based on luni-solar calendars, the Gregorian calendar dates can shift, but this shift is typically less than a month. This is because the luni-solar calendars add the intercalary month every few years which correct for the difference between the lunar and the solar year. In contrast, purely lunar calendars do not account for this difference. Any festival celebrated according to the phases of the Moon, such as Eid-ul-fitr, therefore can occur in different months of the Gregorian calendar year after year. Why do most Indian festivals fall on different dates every year?"}
{"id": "class 8__science__p204__c1", "text": "184 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 A step further A few festivals in India, like Makar Sankranti, Pongal, Bihu, Vaisakhi, Poila Baisakh, and Puthandu, follow a solar sidereal calendar. These festivals happen on almost the same date every year in the Gregorian calendar which is based on the tropical year. A long time ago, these festivals were tied to either a solstice or an equinox. Due to the small difference in the sidereal and tropical years, the dates of these festivals slowly shift away from the solstices/equinoxes. This shift is due to slow wobble of the Earth’s axis, similar to the movement of the axis of a wobbling top. This causes the dates of festivals based on the sidereal calendar to move ahead in tropical calendar. For example, Makar Sankranti moves ahead by one day every 71 years. Ever heard of ... The dates of many Indian festivals are based on the exact lunar phase at sunrise. As sunrise occurs earlier in Eastern India and later in Western India, these dates can also shift by a day between these regions even in the same year.

Besides the Moon, man-made satellites sent by various countries also orbit the Earth. These artificial satellites appear as tiny specks moving in the night sky. Most orbit about 800 km above Earth’s surface and take roughly 100 minutes to complete one orbit. These satellites help us in many ways like communication, navigation, weather monitoring, disaster management, and scientific research. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has launched many satellites that support these activities. The Cartosat series of satellites, launched by ISRO, capture high-quality images of the Earth to improve maps, plan cities, and handle natural disasters in India. One such mapping platform, Bhuvan, uses these images to show terrain, soil, land use, vegetation, and more. AstroSat, another ISRO mission, makes scientific observations of stars and other celestial objects. India’s other space missions include Chandrayaan 1, 2, and 3 to the Moon; Aditya L1 to study the Sun; and Mangalyaan to Mars.

When vegetation is scarce and waterholes dry up in their natural habitat, elephants may wander in to nearby farms or plantations in search of food like bananas and sugarcane. This can lead to in crop damage and at times, even harm people and domestic animals. Changes in rainfall and temperature affect vegetation. Cutting down trees for constructing roads and buildings makes it worse. This leads to the shrinking and drying of forests, the natural home of animals. When forests cannot support wildlife, animals tend to move into human habitats. Elephants are adapted to forest life, but sudden changes make it hard for them to survive. Wildlife ecologists have identified and marked corridors in many parts of the country to allow safe movement of animals. These corridors correct forest habitats, enabling wildlife—such as elephants to travel in need between large forest areas without coming into conflict with human settlements. This chain of events shows how closely nature’s elements are connected. To understand such interconnections, we must study the components of our environment. 12.1 \u0007How Do We Experience and Interpret Our Surroundings? You have learnt in Curiosity, Grade 6 chapter ‘Diversity in the Living World’ that different habitats have different kinds of plants and animals. A habitat is simply place where an organism lives.

The similarities are that both habitats have living beings as well as non-living things. However, the types of living beings are different and the non-living things also vary. The living beings you have recorded in Table 12.1 are termed as the biotic components and non-living things as the abiotic components of a habitat. Have you wondered why some organisms live on land while others live in water? Every organism needs specific conditions to survive. From this activity, you can see that different habitats offer different living conditions. In Activity 12.1, you listed fish as a biotic component of the pond. How do fish survive in a pond? A pond provides food, oxygen, shelter, and space to grow — conditions essential for survival of organisms. Fish obtain their biotic needs, such as food, from small plants and animals, and abiotic needs, such as oxygen, from water. Other living beings also inhabit the pond, such as frogs, fresh turtles, snakes, dragonflies, mosquitos, snails, and ducks, along with plants like algae, diatoms, duckweeds, and lotus. They all interact with the other living beings and non-living things present in the places where they grow and thrive. (a) Pond habitat Fig. 12.1: Two types of habitats (b) Forest habitat"}

Different organisms living in the same habitat may use the resources in different ways. A forest might be warm during the day and cool at night. A snake that comes out at night and a rodent active during the day both live in the same habitat, but they face different conditions. This is how living organisms coexist in harmony in the same habitat. 12.2 Who All Live Together in Nature? You have observed fish in a pond in Activity 12.1. Did you see only a single fish? Most likely, you may have seen many fish of the same kind. This group of fish of the same kind living together in a pond habitat is called a population of that particular fish.

In Activities 12.1 and 12.2, you observed that different group of organisms live together in a habitat. A community comprises different populations sharing the same habitat. The biotic components of a habitat, such as the plants, animals, and microorganisms together form the community. These organisms interact and depend on one another for survival. Ever heard of ... You may have seen brightly coloured flowers blooming around you. Have you ever looked closely at their parts?

Think of a reason for these observations. z Compare the number of dragonflies, bees, and butterflies in both the ponds. Do you find any relationship between the number of dragonflies and bees/butterflies? We observed that in Pond A (with fish) the number of dragonflies were less as compared to Pond B. Why? z Fish eat dragonfly larvae, so ponds with fish had fewer dragonflies. Dragonflies usually eat flies, bees and butterflies With fewer dragonflies, more bees, flies, and butterflies were found. These insects help pollinate flowers from nearby areas moving pollen from one flower to another, which helps plants produce seeds. So, flowers near ponds with fish may produce more seeds than those near ponds without fish. z What does this study show? How does the population of fish in a pond affect the seed production in nearby plants? z This study shows how biotic components (fish, dragonflies, pollinators, plants) and abiotic components (temperature, water, nutrients) interact with and affect each other (Fig. 12.4). Similarly, can overfishing by humans change this balance? How do you think it may affect the living and non-living parts of the habitat? 12.4 \u0007What Are the Different Types of Interactions Among Organisms and their Surroundings?

Living organisms, or the biotic community, depend on non-living things, that is abiotic components for their survival. Plants and animals also depend on each other for nutrition, respiration, and reproduction. These are interactions among the biotic components. Both types of interactions — among biotic components, and between biotic and abiotic components — are important for survival in any habitat.

From this, you can infer that the biotic components (plants, animals, and microorganisms) and the abiotic components (air, water, soil, sunlight, and temperature) in a habitat interact with each other to form an ecosystem. Organisms in an ecosystem interact with abiotic components for food, shelter, and protection in an ecosystem. Different communities of living organisms interact with abiotic components in an ecosystems. There are two main types of ecosystems in nature. Aquatic ecosystems include ponds, rivers, and lakes while terrestrial ecosystems include forests, farms or even large trees like banyan, mango, or pilkhan. Hence, ecosystems can be large or small. Can you find overlapping ecosystems in Fig. 12.6? Fig. 12.6 shows an overlap of different terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In this figure, you can see a small river (an aquatic ecosystem) along with mountains, forests, grassland, and farmland, which are examples of terrestrial ecosystems. Farmland is a human-made ecosystem. These ecosystems are interacting with each other at any given point. In Activity 12.4, we have seen the importance of the components and their interactions in an ecosystem. For example, sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water are essential for producing food in plants; soil provides medium and essential nutrients for plant growth; air provides oxygen for respiration in plants as well as animals; water is essential for all living organisms. This shows how living organisms depend on the non-living component of an ecosystem. Just as biotic components depend on abiotic components, abiotic components also depend on biotic components. For example, plants release oxygen during photosynthesis, roots hold soil in place and prevent erosion, and plants retain soil moisture and help cool the atmosphere. You can identify and study any ecosystem in your surroundings and observe different types of interactions among the biotic and abiotic components. While studying biotic interactions, notice how organisms depend on each other for food.

You may have seen small umbrella-like structures, mushrooms, growing on dead plants or trees during the rainy season (Fig. 12.12). These are a type of fungi that grow on dead matter.

You can also find tiny insects, such as beetles and flies, on animal droppings — like elephant dung— as they help break it down and recycle nutrients, back into the environment. This process is called decomposition and the organisms carrying out the process are called decomposers or saprotrophs (sapro= rotten + trophs = food). Plants grow in soil and many of the nutrients in soil come from the decomposition process. Thus, decomposers play an important role in recycling nutrients. In nature, nothing is wasted — everything is reused. Does nature really waste anything? Ever heard of ... India is a country with diverse habitats and seasons. Many migratory birds fly thousands of miles and reach different habitats in India. They migrate from different parts of the world to avoid harsh climate, and in search for food. Birds not only enhance the aesthetics of those habitats but also play a significant role in keeping the balance in an ecosystem as pollinators or seed dispersers along the path they migrate. This way they link two habitats. These birds are predators of insect pests and help farmers to control pest populations, and indirectly help in healthy crop growth.

Reduction in fish population will have cascading effects and there will be less number of consumers in the pond. As a result, insects will increase in number. These insects will spread to nearby farmlands. This is how farmers will be compelled to use pesticides to grow their crops which may again adversely affect the environment. Further consequences may emerge in the form of other environmental issues. Plants die Less oxygen Fish die More insects Plants get damaged by pests Fig. 12.13: One change leads to another What happens when we intervene in nature? Activity 12.9: Let us read In the 1980s, India was a significant exporter of frog legs, especially of the Indian bullfrog (Hoplobatrachus tigerinus) (Fig. 12.14). This large-scale harvesting led to a decline in frog populations. Since frogs eat insects, their reduced numbers resulted in a rise in agricultural pests. This forced farmers to use more synthetic pesticides, which harmed the environment, soil and water quality, and affected the overall environmental and human health. The Government of India banned the export of frog legs to prevent further ecological damage. An ecosystem stays in balance when interactions among organisms and their environment keep populations and resources stable. This balance is dynamic, not fixed, and can be disrupted by natural or human-made changes. Fig. 12.14: Indian bullfrog Fig. 12.15: Competition among a community in an ecosystem 12.8 \u0007How Do Interactions Maintain Balance in Ecosystems? Besides feeding relationships, organisms also compete for common resources like food, water, physical space, or sunlight. This competition helps control population size and keeps the ecosystem balanced. Without it, one species could multiply too much causing an imbalance in the ecosystem (Fig. 12.15). There are other types of relationships too. Based on the example given in Fig. 12.16, what do you observe?"}

Johnsingh) was a famous Indian wildlife biologist who helped us understand forest ecosystems through the eyes of animals. He was a pioneer in studying wildlife through modern tracking system. His research showed how predators like tigers and leopards rely on prey, such as deer and wild boar, while he was working in Bandipur National Park, Karnataka. He proved that a healthy prey population is key to predator survival. He inspired many youngsters to study wildlife and protect the forests and biodiversity of India. 12.9 What Are the Benefits of an Ecosystem? We have learnt that biotic components and abiotic components of an ecosystem depend on each other and support various life processes. Humans also benefit from ecosystems. For example, forests provide fresh air, fertile soil, food, fibres, timber, and medicines. Similarly, aquatic ecosystems provide water and food. Ecosystems also offer aesthetic and recreational value. This benefits and supports our well-being and shows how closely nature and humans are connected. However, when we overuse or misuse natural resources, we disturb the balance in nature. Now let us look at a real-life example of a threatened ecosystem — the Sundarbans."}
{"id": "class 8__science__p224__c1", "text": "204 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 The Sundarbans have the largest mangrove forests in the world. Located where the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers meet between India and Bangladesh, the Sundarbans’ forests and rivers are home to various flora and fauna, many of which are endangered. The Sundarbans protect us by slowing down strong winds and waves during storms and floods. The trees also absorb carbon dioxide from the air and release oxygen. Because of its importance, The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site in 1987. However, the Sundarbans (Fig. 12.17) are under a serious threat. Mangrove trees are being cut for fuelwood and farming. Illegal hunting and overuse of forest resources are a threat to the wildlife living there. Pollution from industrial waste and untreated sewage in rivers are also damaging the water and habitat. These human activities disrupt the natural way ecosystems work. Similarly, other ecosystems across India are also under threat. Problems like deforestation, overuse of natural resources, the spread of invasive species, unsustainable land use, and pollution are damaging forests, rivers, scrublands, wetlands, grasslands, and coastal areas. How can we stop damaging forests, rivers, and wetlands? Think about what actions you and your community can take to protect these important places. Protected areas are parts of land or water set aside to conserve wildlife and their habitats. India has many protected areas like national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, biosphere reserves, and community conserved areas. These places help protect entire habitats including endangered animals, birds, and many rare plants. Famous examples include Jim Corbett National Park (Uttarakhand), Manas National Park (Assam), Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve (Western Ghats), Chilika Lake (Odisha), Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary (Arunachal Pradesh), Hemis National Park (Leh), Keibul Lamjao National Park (Manipur), Pirotan Island Marine National Park (Gujarat).

When well designed, these can help reduce pollution, support biodiversity, and provide recreational spaces for people. Unlike natural ecosystems, these need human care and management. Can you name any human made ecosystem in your area? 12.9.2 How do healthy ecosystems serve our farms? Farming, a major livelihood in India, can become unsustainable if not managed well by applying environment friendly farming practices. Humans have been practising farming for thousands of years to grow food. As the population grew, our dependence on agriculture increased. Between 1950 and 1965, India faced a food crisis due to low crop production. In the mid-20th century, the use of tractors, machines, synthetic fertilisers, and pesticides helped increase food production. This period is known as the Green Revolution. However, these farming methods are now considered unsustainable because of the overuse of synthetic chemicals, excessive groundwater extraction, and growing only one type of crop for commercial gain. How do these practices harm both the environment and human health? Many scientists believe that overusing pesticides and growing the same type of crop repeatedly on the same land leads to soil degradation. Understanding ecosystems can help us adopt better and more sustainable farming practices. Activity 12.10: Let us survey Visit a nearby farm with your parents or teacher/interact with farmers in your community to find out about the farming practices they adopt. z Prepare a list of questions for farmers to find out the pesticides and other farm inputs they use, and whether they reuse or recycle materials to improve their crops.

And why? { What effects do you notice when using synthetic fertilisers and pesticides? { Have you seen any changes in soil health after using these synthetic fertilisers and pesticides? z Interact with farmers based on these questions. Based on your findings, prepare a report."}
{"id": "class 8__science__p226__c1", "text": "206 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 What inference do you draw from your interactions with farmers? Synthetic fertilisers and pesticides have played a vital role in improving crop production and helped countries like India become food secure. However, their long-term use can affect the environment and soil health. Overuse of synthetic fertilisers may reduce soil fertility by decreasing friendly microorganisms in soil and lowering organic matter (humus), which helps bind soil particles. Without enough humus, soil becomes prone to erosion. Also, it reduces the population of natural predators which ultimately increase the population of pests (Fig. 12.18). Heavy irrigation and repeated ploughing can also disturb soil organisms like earthworms and snails, which are important for maintaining ecological balance. Some pests may develop resistance to pesticides, making them difficult to control. Growing the same crop repeatedly, known as monoculture, can reduce crop diversity and affect pollinators, which are crucial for food production. To make farming more sustainable, some farmers are exploring organic and natural farming methods. These aim to reduce the use of synthetic fertilisers and support sustainable farming, with minimal interference in natural ecosystems. Based on your learning, what practices do you think can help farmers protect the soil, the environment, and our food security for the future? The ancient text Vrikshayurveda emphasises on soil health and nourishment. The text strongly advocates for the continuous nourishment of the soil through organic manure like Kunapa Jala (a liquid fertiliser made from animal and plant waste by the process of fermentation; that breaks complex substances into simpler ones) and other composted materials.

It is time to put together all that we have seen and learnt and try to understand why our home, planet Earth, is like no other place in the known universe. As you have learnt in Curiosity, Grades 6 and 7, the Earth is a planet orbiting the Sun. However, it is not just any planet. It is a planet that sustains life — full of diverse landscapes, from towering mountains and vast oceans to endless deserts and lush forests. Today, our satellites allow us to take amazing pictures of our planet. The image in the beginning page was taken by an Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Earth Observation Satellite and made by combining nearly 3000 smaller images, like pieces of a mosaic. Although it looks beautiful, it’s a false colour image, where scientists use different colours to show different types of information. These satellite images help us study plants on land and tiny organisms in the ocean, and can even detect things like ocean temperature, oil spills, and wind direction. In this chapter, we will uncover the unique conditions that make Earth the perfect home for living beings. 13.1 Why Is Earth a Unique Planet? What makes the Earth so special? While there are perhaps billions of planets in the universe, Earth is the only one where life, as we know today, exists and thrives in all its forms. Have you ever wondered where all life on Earth actually exists? All the mountains, rivers, forests, animals, and people are found on just a very thin layer on the surface of our planet. From the tallest mountain to the deepest ocean trench, the crust, where all of life exists, is tiny compared to the size of Earth. If Earth were the size of an apple, the crust would be as thin as the apple’s skin as shown in Fig. 13.1. This delicate, life supporting layer is what makes Earth truly special. crust Fig. 13.1: The Earth’s crust is like the thin skin of an apple Crust Upper mantle Lower mantle Outer core Inner core"}

This is generally correct, except that Venus, the second planet from the Sun has the highest average temperature and is the hottest planet. Why is this so? Venus is the hottest planet not because it is the closest to the Sun, but because its thick atmosphere traps heat."}
{"id": "class 8__science__p234__c1", "text": "214 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 The air on Venus is almost entirely made up of carbon dioxide gas, which does not let the heat escape. This is called the greenhouse effect (Fig. 13.2), and it makes Venus even hotter than Mercury, which is relatively closer to the Sun. On the Earth also, gases like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere trap heat by absorbing the radiation given off by the Earth, after it gets warmed by the Sun. Thus, greenhouse effect plays an important role in maintaining just the right temperature on Earth. A step further The greenhouse effect that causes a planet like Venus and Earth to trap heat does not work the same way as a greenhouse for growing plants in a cool climate. On Venus or Earth, gases like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere trap heat by absorbing the radiation given off by the Earth, after it gets warmed by the Sun. A plant greenhouse, on the other hand, traps warmed air simply because it is a closed space, usually with glass walls (Fig. 13.3). It heats up during the day, but the air stays in and the heat does not escape easily. So while both keep things warm, they do it differently! Fig. 13.3: Greenhouse for plants 13.3 What Makes the Earth Suitable for Life to Exist ? 13.3.1 Position of the Earth The most important reason why the Earth can support life is its distance from the Sun. It is just at the right distance, where the temperature allows water to exist in a liquid form. If the Earth were closer to the Sun, it would be too hot and all the water would evaporate; if it were farther away, it would be too cold, and all the water would freeze. In such extreme conditions, it would have been impossible for most life forms — especially plants, animals, and humans — to grow and thrive on Earth. Although some microbes, like certain Fig. 13.4: The habitable zone around a star Habitable zone Too hot Just right Too cold Fig. 13.2: Schematic of greenhouse effect on Earth"}

Earth’s distance from the Sun allows water to remain mostly in liquid form, which is essential for the development and sustenance of life in all its form. The range of distances from the Sun (or another star) over which water remains liquid is called the habitable zone, or sometimes also called the ‘Goldilocks zone’ (Fig. 13.4). As you have also studied in Social Science, most of Earth’s surface is covered with water. Thus, when seen from space, the Earth looks blue because of the vast amount of water—hence the name Blue Planet (Fig. 13.5). Did Mars ever support life? Mars lies at the edge of the Sun’s habitable zone. Several spacecrafts have been sent to Mars, rovers have landed and explored its surface, but no proof of life has been found yet. However, scientists think that in the past, Mars may have had liquid water — maybe even some lakes — and conditions that could support simple life forms (Fig. 13.6). This is one reason Mars continues to interest scientists. It also reminds us that science doesn’t always have final answers. As we explore more, we may find new clues—or even new kinds of life. Science stays open to change when we learn more. Fig. 13.6: Mars A step further Is the temperature or distance from the Sun, the only factor that makes the Earth habitable?

However, moderate temperature due to the right distance from the Sun isn’t the only factor that makes the Earth habitable. The planet is also the right size to support an atmosphere. As you learnt earlier, the atmosphere is the layer of gases that surrounds the Earth, and it plays a major role in sustaining life. You also learnt in Chapter 5 that the Earth’s gravity pulls objects towards it. If Earth were much smaller (but with the same average density), its gravity would have been too weak to hold on to the gases in our atmosphere, and they would have escaped into space. On Mars, the atmosphere is 100 times thinner than on Earth, and Mercury has no atmosphere at all. On the other hand, if the planet was too large, and gravity was much stronger, it would perhaps pull us down to the planet with such a large force that our bones could get crushed! Due to the right size of the Earth, it is able to support atmosphere which is essential for life. The presence of oxygen in the Earth’s atmosphere allows us to breathe, and is needed by almost all forms of life on Earth. But oxygen has another important role. Some of the oxygen in our atmosphere, gets converted to another form called ozone (a three-atom oxygen molecule), and forms an important part of the atmosphere called the ozone layer. This layer acts like a shield, blocking harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays from the Sun that can damage living cells. Our scientific heritage India’s Mangalyaan (Mars Orbiter Mission), launched in 2013 by Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), was a big step in exploring Mars (Fig. 13.7). It carried tools to study the planet’s atmosphere, surface, and signs of past water. Some of these sensors help scientists ask big questions — like was Mars ever suitable for life? Mangalyaan showed the world that India could do space science with smart, low-cost technology — and it helped bring Mars closer to all of us. Fig. 13.7: Mangalyaan"}

This is because the Earth itself behaves like a giant magnet. You have also seen in Chapter 4 that the region around a magnet where its effect is felt has a magnetic field. It is believed that the movement of molten iron in Earth’s core may be the origin for Earth’s magnetic field. Earth is constantly hit by tiny, high-energy particles that come from space. Some come from far across the universe and are called cosmic rays. Other particles come from the Sun and are called the solar wind. These particles can be harmful as they can damage the atmosphere, reduce the ozone layer, and let in more harmful UV rays, which can affect life on Earth. Thankfully, the Earth’s magnetic field acts like a protective shield. It pushes many of these harmful particles away from the Earth, keeping our atmosphere, and hence life on our planet safe. Earth’s unique position in the solar system — allows the presence of liquid water — along with its size, atmosphere, and magnetic field, all help make it a planet where life can emerge and thrive. But, how is life supported and sustained on Earth? Does the magnetic field of the Earth have any role in sustaining life on Earth? 13.4 What Allows Life to Be Sustained on Earth? Earth has the right conditions for life, but it is the beautiful connections between living and non-living things that help life to thrive. In Curiosity, Grades 6 and 7, you learnt about key natural resources, such as, air, water, sunlight, soil, and minerals. You also learnt about the important life processes in plants and animals. Now, let us explore how all these elements interact to support and sustain life on Earth. 13.4.1 Air, water, and sunlight We know that the atmosphere contains oxygen, which humans, animals, and plants use for respiration. In the presence of sunlight, plants take carbon dioxide from the air and water from"}

In the process, oxygen is released, which is needed for respiration. We have learnt, radiation from the Sun heats the Earth. Some of this heat is trapped by the atmosphere due to the greenhouse effect. This effect though mild, keeps the temperature just high enough for water to remain in the liquid state. In Curiosity, Grade 7, you also learnt about heat transfer by radiation. Without an atmosphere, the Earth would lose heat to space and become too cold. So the greenhouse effect helps keep the Earth warm. Water is essential for life. You have learnt that it covers about 70 per cent of the Earth’s surface and is found in ponds, lakes, rivers, springs, seas, oceans, and groundwater. All this water forms the hydrosphere. In Chapter 7, you learnt that water is a good solvent. In Curiosity, Grade 7, we learnt how water transports nutrients from soil to leaves in plants. In animals, it regulates body temperature, aids digestion, and ensures hydration, all essential for health and life. Though much of Earth is covered by water, we still know little about what lives deep in the oceans. The hydrosphere is home to millions of life forms, from tiny planktons to giant whales, many still being discovered. Oceans, lakes, and rivers provide rich environments for aquatic life (Fig. 13.8). Freshwater is also needed to grow crops and support people around the world. Water vapour in the air forms clouds and brings rain or snow. This refills rivers, lakes, and underground water. Rainfall affects the kinds of plants and animals that can live in a place. Moving air also shapes weather and rainfall — which influence farming, water supply, and life on land. 13.4.2 Soil, rocks, and minerals Beneath our feet lies something remarkable — the Earth’s crust, made of rocks, soil, and minerals. It may seem hard and lifeless, but it provides almost everything life needs to grow and survive. From soil that helps plants grow to minerals that give us salt, coal, oil, and metals like iron and copper — this outer layer support both ecosystems and human life. The solid parts of the Earth, including materials like rocks, soils, and minerals are known as the geosphere. Soil may look like simple dirt, but it is rich in nutrients like nitrogen and potassium that plants need to grow. These nutrients come from the slow breakdown of rocks and the remains of plants and animals. Fig. 13.8: Life in water"}
{"id": "class 8__science__p239__c1", "text": "Chapter 13 — Our Home: Earth, a Unique Life Sustaining Planet 219 There are various types of landforms, rocks, soils, etc., on Earth. This variety along with the processes that shape and alter them is called geodiversity (Fig. 13.9). It helps create unique habitats where different types of life can thrive. The non-living parts of nature, like soil, rocks, and water, aren’t just a background — they help shape the story of life itself. 13.4.3 Plants, animals, and microorganisms From the chapter on microbes to the chapter on ecology, we have seen that the Earth is full of life — from trees, shrubs, herbs, to animals, insects, and tiny organisms invisible to the naked eye. All living beings, along with the places where they live, make up the biosphere. This includes land, water, and air, where life interacts with its surroundings to survive and grow. As you learnt in Chapter 12, living beings depend on one another and their environment. Plants make food through photosynthesis, animals eat plants or other animals, and decomposers break down dead matter and return nutrients to the soil. Nature works together as a system to support life. 13.4.4 The importance of balance Have you ever wondered how so many things on Earth stay in balance? Earth is like a giant teamwork project between nature, weather, and life itself. It is a vast, living system where land, air, water, and living things support and affect one another. Even a small change in one part — like cutting down a forest — can impact rainfall, soil, air quality, and the animals that live there. Life on Earth survives not because of just one thing, but because everything works together in balance. It is this balance that keeps our planet habitable. That’s why preserving and protecting clean air, water, soil, and all forms of life isn’t just important but essential for keeping Earth healthy for the future. 13.5 What Keeps Life from Disappearing? If plants and animals didn’t reproduce, life would eventually disappear from Earth. Reproduction ensures that each type of organism continues to exist, maintaining the continuity of life. We usually expect that animals will produce young ones that resemble them — cows have calves, and cats have kittens. This happens because parents pass on instructions to their offspring about how to develop from a single cell. These instructions, Fig. 13.9: Geodiversity"}
{"id": "class 8__science__p240__c1", "text": "220 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 called genetic material or genes, are stored inside every cell of a living being. You can think of genes as a detailed instruction manual inside each cell. Some instructions tell the cell how to make blood, while others guide the formation of bones, muscles, or skin. Together, these instructions ensure that a calf grows into a cow, or a kitten grows into a cat. But reproduction does more than just create more of the same kind of living beings. It also allows for small changes in the instructions that are passed down from parents to offpsrings. Sometimes, these changes help a plant or animal survive better in a new environment. For example, over time, camels developed humps to store fat and survive in deserts. Even microbes evolve — some bacteria, as you learnt in the chapter on health, have become resistant to antibiotics, helping them persist. Over many generations, such changes can lead to new features — or even completely new types of living beings. So, reproduction not only keeps each kind continuing, but also helps life adapt change, and continue in new forms (Fig. 13.10). But how can the same process lead both to similarity (an animal gives birth to similar individual, such as a cow gives birth to a cow) and variation (shows different characteristics like difference in color and height of to individuals of some kind)? That is a fascinating puzzle. There are two types of reproductive processes — one in which the young are almost exactly like their parent and another in which they look slightly different from their parents. In asexual reproduction, a single parent produces new individuals that are exact copies of itself (exact in terms of the instructions inside the cell). In sexual reproduction, instructions from two parents combine to create offspring that are not exactly like either of the parent. They share some traits with both parents, but also have differences. This mixing helps keep useful features while allowing new ones to appear. Over many generations, these small differences can add up — leading to big differences, and even new life forms. Let’s explore how reproduction takes place in plants and animals, and how it helps living beings develop special features and sometimes change over time. 13.5.1 Asexual reproduction Many plants can reproduces when any part of the plants — leaf, stem, or root — is planted in soil. This kind of reproduction is called vegetative propagation. Fig. 13.10: Development of calf to cow"}

Activity 13.3: Let us find out z Take some parts of plants like stem cutting of a money plant, the ‘eyes’ of a sprouted potato, or a piece of ginger (Fig. 13.11b). z Plant each of them separately in moist soil (not too deep). For money plant, you can just put a cutting in a glass container which makes it easy to observe. z Make sure they get all the conditions they need to grow—like water, air, and sunlight. z Watch them every day and note how many days it takes for roots stem and leaves to appear.

For example, single-celled organisms like bacteria and amoebae divide into two identical individuals. Some multicellular organisms like algae can regrow from small cut parts.

Scientists study them to understand regeneration in animals. Ever heard of ... Not just plants — microbes and simple animals also reproduce asexually.

Scientists study this organism to understand regeneration in animals. Fig. 13.12: Planaria 13.5.2 Sexual reproduction In this type of reproduction, two parents are involved — usually called male and female. This is easy to observe in animals, but did you know even flowering plants have male and female parts? Some microorganisms like bacteria and yeast also have two ‘mating types’ that act like the two parents. Special cells for reproduction You might wonder if both parents pass on their genetic material for making a new organism, won’t the child end up with double the amount of instructions? And would not this keep doubling every generation? This does not happen because each parent makes specialised reproductive cells, called gametes. These carry only half of the parent’s genetic material . When male and female gametes join, they form a new cell with a complete set of instructions — half from each parent. How do bamboo and sugarcane grow into new plants? I have never seen their seeds. Fig. 13.11: Vegetative propagation — (a) Ginger; (b) Potato (b) (a)"}
{"id": "class 8__science__p242__c1", "text": "222 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 Babies do not look exactly like their mother or father. Even brothers and sisters in the same family can look different from each other. This is because every baby gets a mix of genetic information from both parents through gametes. Each gamete carries a different set of instructions for things like eye colour, hair type, and more. These instructions mix in different ways when the sperm and eggs joins to form a baby. These instructions mix in different ways each time, so each child is unique. No wonder one child may ‘inherit’ a nose similar to mother and another may inherit eyes similar to father. It all depends on which pieces of the parent’s ‘instruction book set’ came together. Sexual reproduction in plants Plants use different parts of their flowers to produce male and female gametes. Pollen grains found inside the anther of a flower are the male gametes, while ovules, found deep inside the flower, are the female gametes. Pollen is carried to another flower by wind, insects, or animals — this process is called pollination. When the male and female gametes combine, it is called fertilisation, forming a zygote that becomes the seed. The fleshy part of the flower around the ovule develops into a fruit (Fig. 13.13). When birds or animals eat the fruit, the seeds often get dropped far from the original plant — a helpful way for plants to spread. That’s how a banyan seed, dropped by a bird that ate a fruit and excreted the seed, might sprout in a crack in a wall after the rains. When seeds get water, they use stored nutrients to grow roots and shoots. Remember in Grade 6 you had studied the germination of seeds where you observed tiny shoots and the first leaves appear. Sexual reproduction in animals In animals, gametes are called sperm (male) and eggs (female). Fertilisation may take place in water, for example, male and female fish or frogs eject sperm and eggs, respectively, into the water where they combine to form the zygote. In these animals, the development of the zygote into an embryo also takes place in water (Fig. 13.14). In birds and mammals, including humans, sperm are deposited inside the female and fertilisation takes place when the sperm swim towards the egg produced by the female. After this step, birds and mammals follow different processes. Zygote Fertilisation Egg cell Sperm cell Fig. 13.14: Formation of zygote Ovule Anther Fig. 13.13: A flower"}
{"id": "class 8__science__p243__c1", "text": "Chapter 13 — Our Home: Earth, a Unique Life Sustaining Planet 223 In birds, the fertilised egg (zygote) is ‘laid’ by the female. The development of the zygote into an embryo happens after the egg is laid during the hatching process. Think about how much ‘food’ the female parent has to put into each egg — it has to last for the developing embryo until it hatches. This is one strategy to ensures supply of nutrition to the embryo. In most mammals, the development of the zygote into an embryo takes place inside the body of the female. The mother’s body provides all the food and oxygen the baby needs to grow until it is born. This is a different way of giving nutrition to the developing baby, compared to animals like birds that lay eggs. What are the advantages and disadvantages of giving birth to young ones vs. laying eggs? Do you think animals like dogs, cows, or humans could lay eggs like birds? Why or why not? 13.6 What Are the Threats to Life on Earth? We know that life on Earth depends on a delicate balance of living and non-living things working together. But human actions are disturbing this balance. Even small changes in global temperature, oxygen levels, or the ozone layer can put life at risk. Today, the biggest environmental challenges that we face are climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution — together known as the triple planetary crisis. Burning fossil fuels like coal and oil releases greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane. These trap even more heat in the atmosphere which causes global warming. Normally, Earth keeps a balance since trees, plants, and even tiny ocean planktons absorb carbon dioxide as they grow. But when we burn fossil fuels, we release extra carbon that has been locked underground for millions of years. The Earth cannot absorb this fast enough, so the heat builds up. Even a small increase in temperature can melt ice caps, raise sea levels which could flood many coastal cities, cause extreme weather conditions, and lead to many plants and animals disappearing. These long-term changes in temperature, rainfall, and weather patterns are called climate change. When natural habitats are destroyed, plants and animals may disappear, upsetting ecosystems. For example, as we saw in Chapter 12, if grasses vanish, animals that feed on them like deer or grasshoppers struggle to survive. And without herbivores, predators like tigers or foxes lose their food too. Every type of living thing has a role, and losing even a few weakens nature’s ability to support life."}
{"id": "class 8__science__p244__c1", "text": "224 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 Pollution adds to the problem. Air pollution from factories, vehicles, and burning fuels harms both people and the nature. It can cause breathing problems, damage crops, and lead to smog and acid rain (Fig. 13.15). Climate change affects everything—from crop growth and water supply to wildlife habitats and human health. To protect life on Earth, we need to cut pollution, use cleaner energy, and make wiser choices. We have also learnt that life on Earth flourishes within a delicate balance supported by interdependent natural systems. However, this balance is increasingly threatened by human actions. For example, a little less or more of oxygen in air, or a little lower or higher temperature of the Earth, or a little less of ozone in the atmosphere, could endanger life on the Earth. Countries around the world have made global agreements to protect the environment. The Montreal Protocol (1987) helped reduce harmful chemicals like Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), allowing the ozone layer to slowly recover. The Earth Summit (1992) led to international efforts on climate change and biodiversity. Later, the Kyoto Protocol (2005) and Paris Agreement (2015) committed countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Paris Agreement set a goal to limit global warming to below 1.5 °C, but as of 2025, the world is not on track to meet that goal. Much more action is needed to avoid any more adverse effects of climate change. Ever heard of ... Water and soil pollution are serious threats to life (Fig. 13.16). Factory, farm and plastic waste harm aquatic life and make water unsafe. Excess fertilisers and poor waste disposal pollute soil, reduce crop yield, and spread harmful substances through the food chain. Protecting them requires better waste management and sustainable farming practices. We have seen above that all the Earth system, such as hydrosphere, biosphere, atmosphere and geosphere are connected — so damage to one can affect the others. Protecting the climate means cutting down on greenhouse gases by using renewable energy like solar and wind, improving energy use, and choosing environmentally friendly ways to travel. At the same time, preserving Fig. 13.16: Water pollution Fig. 13.15: Air pollution"}

At the same time, it aims to prepare students to engage constructively with the opportunities and challenges of the 21st century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. By nurturing students’ inherent abilities across all the five planes of human existence (pañchakośhas), the Foundational and the Preparatory Stages set the stage for further learning at the Middle Stage. Spanning Grade 6 to Grade 8, the Middle Stage serves as a critical three-year bridge between the Preparatory and Secondary Stages. The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages — including at least two languages native to India — to Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education, promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas, as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy — a role that strikes a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry.

For all practical purposes, it has, to my mind, succeeded in its curricular goals: first, to foster natural curiosity among students through a proper selection of content; and second, to employ a pedagogical approach in line with the recommendations of NCF-SE 2023. However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years.

In Social Science, this year we will explore more aspects of our country, India, across all five themes — India and the World: Land and the People, Tapestry of the Past, Our Cultural Heritage and Knowledge Traditions, Governance and Democracy, and Economic Life Around Us. You will encounter different types of people who lived in the past, their accomplishments and their mistakes, the impact they had on the economy, society and culture, and what they mean to us today. As you are older now, there will be a little more independent reading, writing and doing through reflective exercises and activities including some small research studies that you would need to take up. There is a little more text in the book as well. As with Grades 6 and 7, we have made ample use of colourful maps, pictures and illustrations, which we hope will help you to visualise better. Since good education should promote understanding and reflection, we have created opportunities for you to explore, discover, think, imagine, create, ask questions and propose answers. You will notice how each theme brings together multiple inputs from several disciplines — not only history, geography, political science or economics, but also art, literature and science. This brings us closer to real life and helps us understand the events of today. In short, you will observe that the threads of the past continue to be part of today’s tapestry and give us the design for strengthening it for tomorrow. Given India’s rich past and enormous dimensions — both geographical and human — we were very eager to share a lot with you; deciding what to include and what to leave out led to arguments and heartaches, because all those involved wanted to give you the best. In the end, it has been an enriching and"}

By now, you are more confident in studying Social Science and are ready to go deeper. This year, our journey will take us on an exploration and reflection on natural resources and how we use them, the tapestry of our past as political and cultural transformations took place, and how we have organised the functioning of our democracy through our electoral process. Together we'll continue asking important questions about how societies organise themselves, how resources become products, and how citizens participate in governance. This textbook has interesting features. As you flip through it, you will see colourful illustrations, including pictures, maps and drawings of many kinds. Let us give you a quick tour of the book and its features. Your teacher will also guide you through it. Each chapter begins with an inspiring quotation from a renowned person or text. Read it and let it stay with you. Some of these quotations are profound thoughts. Don’t worry if you do not understand right away; you can return to them later, and they can also be discussed in the class. Here’s an example — The main text is written in simple language.

But we will also encounter some words in Sanskrit and a few other Indian languages. The Roman alphabet cannot make their pronunciation clear without some additional marks or signs, such as dashes, dots or accents, called ‘diacritical signs’ or ‘diacritics’. You can ignore all these signs if you wish, and you don’t need to remember them. However, as we are using only a few simple signs, you will find it easy to get used to them. You will also find that they help you pronounce Sanskrit words fairly correctly. (Please note that for proper names, we have used diacritics only up to 1200 CE, not afterwards.) Here is how they work:  A short dash (called ‘macron’) over a vowel makes it long. For instance, dāna is pronounced ‘daana’; līlā is pronounced ‘leelaa’; sūtra is sootra.  śh and ṣh are pronounced more or less as ‘sh’ in ‘shall’ (there is a slight difference, since they correspond to श and ष in the Devanagari script, but you can ignore it in practice). So śhāstra is pronounced ‘shaastra’; kṣhīra is ‘ksheera’.  Consonants with a dot below them (ḍ, ṭ and ṇ mainly) are ‘hard’, i.e. pronounced by hitting the tongue on the palate; without a dot, they"}

(As a rough comparison, in the preceding English word ‘teeth’, the first ‘t’ is hard, while the final ‘th’ is soft.) Examples of hard consonants: Āryabhaṭa, gaṇa, paṭhana (studying), pīṭha, goṣṭhī (association, assembly), dhanāḍhya (rich), aṇu (atom).  Finally, ṛ is the Devanagari letter :. We choose to write it as ṛi, although in some parts of India it is also pronounced as ṛu. So we write ‘Ṛig Veda’, for instance.

{"id": "class 8__sst__p24__c1", "text": "2 Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 8 Part 1 When does Nature become a Resource? One of the meanings of the word ‘Nature’ is the totality of life and non-life forms that are part of our environment but have not been created by humans. When humans use these for their sustenance, or create new things from them for consumption, these elements of Nature become ‘resources’. For example, trees are part of the environment; they exist independently of humans. When we cut them and convert their wood into furniture, we see the trees as a resource. Often these entities are not easily accessible. For example, there may be petroleum in places deep under the ocean that we do not have the technology to access, or the extraction cost may be too high; or it may be culturally unacceptable like cutting trees in sacred groves. So, for an entity to be called a resource, it should be technologically accessible, and its exploitation should be economically feasible and culturally acceptable. (Usually, the word ‘exploitation’ has a negative connotation; in the context we use it here, it means ‘extraction, utilisation and consumption of Natural resources’.) The Earth has treasures, many of which have formed over millions of years, and which humans have taken and learnt to use. These include the most obvious ones like water, air and soil, and also the not-so-obvious ones like coal, petroleum, precious stones, metal ores, timber, etc. Fig. 1.2.

You have read about this. In such traditions, Nature is a nurturer and nourisher. Æ Do you know of practices that reflect this? THINK ABOUT IT Take a pause. Look at yourself and the things around you. What is the origin of each of them? At some point they all lead to Nature; even the plastic button on your shirt. In short, we apply the term ‘natural resources’ to materials and substances that occur in Nature and are valuable to humans. Categories of Natural Resources In Science, we learn the usefulness of categorisation and naming — we use some shared characteristics (or criteria) when we categorise ideas or things; we name the categories so that we can refer to them with just one word or a short phrase. When these names and meanings are shared across groups of people, it helps Fig. 1.6. Tulasī puja for wellbeing Fig. 1.5. Honey from a beehive Fig. 1.4.

We can communicate more effectively, too. In earlier classes, you learnt about living and non-living things. As soon as we use these words, you know what they mean. This is a simple example of categories. We do the same with natural resources. THINK ABOUT IT What might be the different criteria we can use to categorise natural resources? One of the ways we could categorise natural resources is based on the uses we put them to — essential for our life, source for materials and sources for energy. Resources essential for life Life could not exist on Earth without the air we breathe, the water we drink and the food we eat. We take these from the atmosphere, the rivers and ponds, and through the cultivation of soil or other living things. We cannot make the air we breathe, the water we drink, or the soil which gives us food. Resources for materials Human beings create physical objects out of Nature’s gifts. We make them for our utility or to create things of beauty that enrich our lives and those of others ― a piece of wood can be transformed into a chair and also carved into a statuette. India’s geographical diversity provides us with a wide variety of natural resources, from wood to marble, and coal to gold. Resources for energy Energy is a cornerstone of modern living — electricity for our buildings, transportation, and all types of production processes. This energy can come from diverse natural sources: coal, water, petroleum, natural gas, sunlight, wind, etc."}
{"id": "class 8__sst__p27__c1", "text": "5 India and the World: Land and the People 1 – Natural Resources and Their Use Renewable and non-renewable resources A second way of categorising natural resources could be based on whether they are renewable or not. A general principle of Nature is that it functions in a restorative and regenerative way. Restoration is the process of returning something to its original healthy state if it has been degraded or damaged. Nature heals, renews and maintains herself over time. A cut on your skin will normally heal; a forest recovers after a wildfire. Regeneration goes beyond restoration. It is about Nature’s ability to create new life and the conditions for thriving. We plant trees in areas that may have lost them on account of human interventions like clearing forests for housing. Planting the types of trees that were originally growing there restores the ecosystem — the trees provide food and shelter for birds, squirrels and other creatures, enabling life to return. Nature works in cycles where there is no waste. Take a forest. Let’s say a tree falls in the forest. It decomposes with the bacteria, fungi and insects feeding on it. The tree becomes part of the soil enriching it. New trees and plants grow from seeds … eventually some will fall and the cycle starts again. These are examples of Nature’s principle of restoration and regeneration in practice. Renewable resources Renewable resources exhibit these characteristics over time. Most of India has abundant sunshine. In the natural course, rivers are Fig. 1.7. River water, a renewable resource as long as glaciers and forests exist Fig. 1.8. We can take timber from the forest, in limited quantities, for a long time if we allow it to regenerate."}
{"id": "class 8__sst__p28__c1", "text": "6 Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 8 Part 1 fed regularly by rain and melting glaciers, forests renew themselves, soil replenishes itself through natural processes, and so on. Solar energy, wind energy, energy from flowing water, timber from forests are renewable resources as long as we are able to manage them in a sustainable manner. However, for them to remain renewable there is a condition — the natural rhythm of restoration and regeneration must not be disturbed. If we harvest timber faster than the forest can grow trees, we will eventually deplete the forest. Scientists have shown that through irresponsible human actions, many of Nature’s cycles have been disturbed. A combination of several factors interacting — fossil fuel-driven industrialisation and the cutting down of forests for agriculture and other purposes are two of them — has led to rising temperatures that we are experiencing; on account of this, the glaciers in some places in the Himalayas are melting at a rate faster than precipitation can replace them. This has implications on water security for the populations living in the plains dependent on the ‘water tower’. DON’T MISS OUT Æ Traditionally, communities had a system of regulating (or refraining from) fishing during the spawning season to enable the maintenance of the fish population. However, the commercialisation of fishing resulted in over-fishing. In the case of a type of fish called tuna, for example, the rapid and extensive decline in their population led to some agreements on control of fishing. Nevertheless, this important type of fish that keeps the ocean ecosystem in balance by consuming smaller fish, shrimps, etc., is on a decline.

The process also creates wastes that are frequently discharged into rivers and other water bodies. Often, these wastes cannot decay to become the food of some lifeform. Instead, it leads to a disturbance in Nature’s cycle of restoration and regeneration, leading to a situation where the river becomes poisonous and cannot support life. LET’S EXPLORE Identify human actions in your surroundings that result in Nature losing her ability to restore and regenerate. What types of interventions can be undertaken to restore Nature’s cycle? DON’T MISS OUT Æ Ecosystem functions and ecosystem services: Nature has some inherent ways of working. For example, trees naturally produce oxygen. When these natural processes benefit humans, we call them ‘ecosystem services’.

When we benefit from clean water, protected farmland, and pollinated crops because of that forest, we are receiving ecosystem services from Nature.

Non-renewable resources Non-renewable resources are created over long periods. They cannot be replenished at the rate we use them. For example, fossil fuels (coal and petroleum), and minerals and metals like iron, copper and gold, are non-renewable resources. India has significant quantities of coal reserves. We mine coal to meet our growing need for energy, but it has been estimated that the coal reserves in India may last another 50 years; the demand for electricity has been increasing as the population expands and development work accelerates.

Some regions rich in natural resources can experience slower economic growth and development — a phenomenon economists call the ‘natural resource curse’ or the ‘paradox of plenty’. Put very simply, this means that often having plenty of natural resources does not automatically mean that a country is rich. Frequently, economies are unable to develop industries that convert the resources into products of higher value; the chapter ‘Factors of Production’ in the latter part of this book will give you an understanding of this. India has generally avoided this curse by investing in the development of such industries to meet our growing needs. LET’S EXPLORE What do you think are the different inputs required to enable the use of the natural resources available in different geographical areas? However, the challenge of balancing resource extraction with sustainability remains.

Scientists studying these aspects have warned that the irresponsible treatment of natural resources has led to pollution, biodiversity loss and climate change, which has been taking place at an increased pace in recent years. Restoration and regeneration of renewable resources Here are two examples of how we are pushing the use of natural resources beyond their capacity to regenerate. Many farmers in our country extract groundwater for irrigation purposes. In most states, the extraction rate is greater than the rate at which the water table is replenished. Over time, this deficit builds up, leading to higher cost of extraction of groundwater and eventually to its unavailability. It has been predicted that many of our growing cities will run out of groundwater soon. Initiatives to raise groundwater levels have been launched to remedy this. Traditional practices of water harvesting, rejuvenation of ponds and tanks, cutting down on wasteful consumption of water, processing and reusing water are some of the strategies attempted. Similarly, the improper use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides has led to soil degradation. Tradi- tional farming practices considered soil to be part of Mother Earth. Practices like the use of cow dung and other natural fertilisers, mulching, multi-cropping, and so on, enabled holistic soil management.

Overexploitation of groundwater: a caselet from Punjab A crisis has unfolded in the fertile plains of Punjab where groundwater resources have been severely depleted. Punjab was home to the Green Revolution that fed a large proportion of our population, and contributed to India becoming self-sufficient in food. Today the same state faces issues of sustainability — Nature has been exploited beyond regeneration, at least in the short term. However, this concern is not particular to Punjab; it affects many other states. In the 1960s, farmers shifted to high-yielding varieties of wheat and paddy. These required more water than the traditional seeds, and farmers began to extract groundwater to meet this need. In addition, the supply of free power led to the over-pumping of groundwater (a situation still prevalent in much of India today). Modern farming techniques also required the use of chemical pesticides and fertilisers. The combined effect of these factors is that the groundwater level in a large part of Punjab (see fig. 1.17) has become inaccessible till depths of about 30 metres; and the chemicals from the pesticides and fertilisers have dissolved in the groundwater causing health hazards.

Our houses, schools and hospitals and other buildings, bridges, roads and airports, all require cement. The production of cement has been listed as one of the most polluting industries. The process of production releases fine dust that enters our lungs and those of animals damaging them, settles on leaves of plants decreasing their yields, and causes soil and water pollution too. The Central Pollution Control Board has created guidelines for cement factories to ensure that the pollution is minimised or eliminated. In addition, there is a move towards creating alternative materials that reduce pollution. These include the use of traditional materials like stone and mud, new plant-based materials and recycled materials from waste plastic. Fig. 1.19.

The term comes from Sanskrit, with vṛikṣha meaning tree and ayurveda meaning the science of life or health. This traditional knowledge system dates back several millennia and was formalised in texts such as Surapala’s Vṛikṣhāyurveda around the 10th century CE. It has elaborate recommendations on the specific plants to be grown on different soil types, and provides intricate methods for seed collection, preservation, and pre-planting treatments. Irrigation techniques are elaborately described, with recommendations varying according to plant species, growth stage, and seasonal conditions. It specifies pest management strategies through natural repellents and plants that should be grown together. This form of sustainable agriculture promotes practices like crop rotation and mixed cropping to maintain soil health. Vṛikṣhāyurveda also offers advice on proper methods of ploughing soil so as to retain soil moisture as well as facilitate the growth of living organisms in the soil like fungi, bacteria and earthworms.

But while every country may have had such peaceful eras and some benevolent rulers, history seems peopled by incompetent, corrupt or cruel rulers. We find them especially in what we may call the darker chapters or periods of history, when war, abuse, fanaticism, bloodshed, etc., suddenly dominate the landscape and inflict suffering and misery on the whole society or country. The world over, historians have faced this dilemma: how much attention should we draw to such darker periods? Should we omit them entirely? Should we mention them in passing, with most atrocious details left out? Or should we face them and analyse them so as to understand what made such developments possible and, hopefully, help avoid their recurrence in future? The third option is, in our opinion, the best, if it can be done with enough detachment and sensitivity; it is important to know our past, pleasant or unpleasant, since the past continues to live with us and shapes the present. What do we mean by ‘detachment and sensitivity’? Simply that it is important to study those darker developments dispassionately, without blaming anyone living today for them. For instance, you will learn later that World War II (1939–1945) resulted in millions of deaths worldwide; Germany then followed a cruel ideology (known as ‘Nazism’) which believed in the extermination of ‘inferior races’ and resulted in the inhuman treatment of some ethnic groups and a brutal rule of occupied nations. Yet it would be clearly unacceptable to blame today’s Germans for what happened over eight decades ago. Rather, what matters is to understand what made the Nazi ideology possible, so that similar ideologies today or tomorrow may be defeated. The same principle applies to the ‘Tapestry of the Past’ chapters in this textbook, which include passages on warfare and instances of cruelty or brutality. While those happenings cannot be erased or denied, it would be wrong to hold anyone today responsible for them. Understanding the historical origin of cruel violence, abusive misrule or misplaced ambitions of power is the best way to heal the past and build a future where, hopefully, they will have no place."}

It was once thought to mark a dark age before the development of modern science; but, of course, Europe’s and India’s histories are very different, so applying the same term ‘medieval’ to both is not ideal, and historians do not always agree on which period it covers in India.

This Sultanate saw the rule of five successive foreign dynasties of Turkic-Afghan origin — the Mamluks (or ‘Slave dynasty’), the Khiljis (or Khaljis), the Tughlaqs, the Sayyids, and the Lodis (or Lodhis). While certain parts of northern India came under the control of the Delhi Sultanate, neighbouring kingdoms, such as the Eastern Gangas in the east and the Hoysalas in the south resisted its advance (Fig. 2.3) and also emerged as thriving centres of art, culture, and administration. The city of Delhi also assumed a bigger role in the political landscape of northern India. The Sultanate period was marked by political instability combined with efforts at territorial expansion.

His slave-general Malik Kafur expanded the Sultanate’s reach southward, conquering several kingdoms on the way; their plundered wealth helped finance the Sultanate’s enormous military apparatus.

Although this dominance was significant, it proved to be short-lived. Muhammad bin Tughlaq had ambitious schemes, but they were often poorly executed. One such was moving his capital from Delhi to Daulatabad (then called ‘Devagiri’, near present-day Sambhaji Nagar); perhaps he thought its more central location would offer better control of the empire. The people were forced to travel over 1,000 km, and a few years later, as his plan misfired, he shifted the capital back to Delhi; both transfers resulted in great loss of life according to some sources. Another instance was the introduction of ‘token currency’, where cheap copper coins were declared to be tokens and have the value of silver or gold coins — although this was a progressive idea (most of our currency today is actually ‘token’), at the time this created confusion in the trade and encouraged people to counterfeit copper coins, all of which caused the economy to decline. The sultans and their court elite lived in luxurious palaces, enjoying elaborate clothing, jewelled ornaments and fine food.

But plunder, in turn, affected trade networks and agricultural production. This period also witnessed numerous attacks on sacred or revered images in Buddhist, Jain and Hindu temples; such destruction was motivated not just by plunder but also by iconoclasm. THINK ABOUT IT Why do we use the term ‘image’ rather than common terms like ‘idol’ or ‘icon’? The latter two terms are considered pejorative in the context of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, whose orthodox sects condemn ‘idolatry’ or the worship of ‘idols’ or ‘icons’. India’s classical texts used words like mūrti, vigraha, pratimā, rūpa, etc., to designate images, often statues, used for worship in temples or homes. In English, ‘image’ is a neutral term. Some of the sultans also imposed the jizya, a tax on non- Muslim subjects to grant them protection and exemption from military service. In practice, depending on the ruler, this discriminatory tax would be a source of economic burden and public humiliation, and formed a financial and social incentive for subjects to convert to Islam. At the end of the 14th century, Timur, a brutal Turkic-Mongol conqueror from central Asia, invaded northwest India and launched a devastating attack on Delhi, then a thriving city. As he wrote in his memoirs, his two-fold objective was to wage “war with the infidels and to gain something by plundering the wealth of the infidels.” Large numbers were killed or enslaved, and the city was left in ruins. Timur soon withdrew from India with huge plunder, leaving chaos behind. In the aftermath, the Lodis emerged and established the last dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate. By then, however, its territory had shrunk considerably in the face of increasing resistance from other states and kingdoms from within India (see Fig. 2.3).

In early conquests, following many of his predecessors’ examples, he showed no mercy at the fort Chittor (or Chittorgarh, in Rajasthan), which he besieged for more than five months in the face of determined resistance from the Rajput soldiers.

With the help of our bloodthirsty sword, we have erased the signs of infidelity from their minds and have destroyed temples in those places and also all over Hindustan.” Akbar followed his predecessors in this thought of his: “A monarch should be ever intent on conquest, otherwise his enemies rise in arms against him.” As his empire grew (Fig. 2.16), he increasingly used political strategies to stabilise it; he entered into marriage alliances with princesses of neighbouring kingdoms, welcomed Rajput and regional leaders into his court, abolished the jizya, and promoted the doctrine of sulh-i- kul — literally, ‘peace with all’ or tolerance of all faiths.

Under his reign the Mughal empire reached its greatest expansion (see Fig. 2.16), though constantly faced with significant rebellions, some of which we will turn to in the next section. Aurangzeb had to spend the last 25 years of his life fighting war after war in the Deccan. Maintaining large armies for those campaigns depleted the empire’s treasury and put a great strain on the administration; indeed, this is often considered one of key factors in the rapid decline of Mughal power after Aurangzeb’s death in 1707. Aurangzeb, who belonged to Islam’s Sunni sect, was deeply religious; he led an austere life, and, unlike Akbar, observed all religious rituals and occasions. He gradually banned practices he regarded as un-Islamic, such as music and dance in his court, and reimposed the jizya tax on non-Muslims as well as a pilgrimage tax on Hindus travelling to their sacred places (both of which had been abolished by Akbar)."}

While politics did play a part in his decisions, Aurangzeb’s own farmans (or firmans, i.e., edicts) make his personal religious motive clear too. In 1669, for instance, he ordered governors of all provinces “to demolish schools and temples of the infidels and put down their teachings and religious practices.” Temples at Banaras (present-day Varanasi), Mathura, Somnath, among many others, were destroyed, as well as Jain temples and Sikh gurudwaras.

Administering India Administration under the Delhi Sultanate The Delhi Sultanate introduced a political system centred on the sultan, who possessed absolute authority as the political and military head, and whose duties, according to contemporary chronicles, included “defending the territories of Islam against possible aggression,” “collecting fees and taxes” and “keeping in touch with public affairs and the condition of the people by personal contact.” The sultan was however assisted by a council of ministers who were in charge of the various departments of the Sultanate. One instrument of the administration was the iqta system, in which territories were assigned to nobles (iqtadars) to collect taxes which, minus expenses, were supposed to go to the Sultan’s treasury; they were needed, in particular, to maintain the army. The system created a network of local administrators loyal to the central authority, but their posts were not hereditary. While taxes were levied on trade at every stage, the burden fell most heavily on the peasantry, and some contemporary accounts report considerable cruelty in extracting revenue from the land. The Mughal administrative framework Aiming at greater control and efficiency, Akbar reorganised his administrative machinery. The Diwan took care of the finances, while the Mir Bakhshi looked after military matters and the Khan-i-Saman was in charge of public works, trade, industry and agriculture, besides the royal household. The Sadr was responsible for justice, religious and educational matters.

As Abul Fazl recorded in his Ain-i-Akbari, which describes Akbar’s administration, mansabdars (officers) according to their mansab (rank) were expected to maintain a precise number of elephants, horses, camels as well as troops for the state. This made it possible to assemble an army at a short notice without having to maintain a permanent centralised army. Regular inspections were carried out to ensure compliance. Mansabdars were generally paid by being assigned land (jagirs) and were therefore also known as jagirdars. Despite Akbar’s growing tolerance for different faiths, non-Muslims were kept in a minority in the higher echelons of the administration; for instance, the total percentage of non- Muslim officials in his Fig. 2.28.

He made detailed surveys for crop yields and prices, and determined prices for each crop on the basis of that information. He also initiated a systematic survey of the land in the entire empire which boosted revenue collection and strengthened the state apparatus. We will see a different kind of administration, that of the Marathas, in the next chapter. People’s Lives Despite shifting political powers between the 13th and 17th centuries, India witnessed vibrant economic activity, thanks to its agrarian foundations, thriving artisanal industries, community-based and temple-based economies, and extensive trade networks. Building on decentralised economic and social systems — such as śhreṇis (guilds), jātis (professionally defined communities), and systems for credit — the Subcontinent remained one of the wealthiest regions in the world. The Sultanate period saw some progress in infrastructural works, especially roads in north India, bridges, a few canals and other irrigation works, apart from the creation of new cities, all of which expanded considerably during the Mughal period. Coins in several metals and denominations were introduced as currency. The Mughals will use a different system, with a rupaya of silver and a dam of copper. Fig. 2.29.

{"id": "class 8__sst__p78__c1", "text": "56 Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 8 Part 1 Agriculture was the mainstay of the Indian economy; we have already seen how rulers relied on agrarian revenue to maintain their administration and military, typically extracting land revenue at one-fifth of the produce, though some of the sultans raised it as high as one- half. The expansion of irrigation systems increased agricultural productivity, allowing for the production of multiple crops, including both food (rice, wheat, barley, pulses, sugarcane, spices, etc.) and non-food items (cotton, which fed a thriving textile production, silk, wool, dyes, timber, jute, etc.). Let us note that agriculture output varied from region to region and period to period; the peasantry suffered several severe famines in this period, with relief depending upon the particular ruler’s benevolence. Apart from textiles, craftspeople made a wide range of products, from weapons to utensils to ornaments and jewellery items. Ship-building, essential to river and overseas trade, developed considerably in those centuries. Indian goods were exported through coastal and riverside towns such as Calicut, Mangalore, Surat, Masulipatnam or Hooghly. India imported much less than it exported; import products included silk, horses, metals, and all kinds of luxury goods. Merchants from Arabia, Persia (now Iran), and Central Asia settled in Indian ports, contributing to the bustling trade activity. The hundi system also enabled merchants to transfer funds across political boundaries without physically transporting currency, making them less vulnerable to plunder. Trader communities, such as the Marwaris, became adept at operating across different political regimes, developing parallel systems of credit and trust that functioned independently of official structures.

It could be carried across political borders and enabled financial transactions without the need to carry currency — a precursor to modern banking. These systems worked across trade networks without the participation of the ruling classes. Temples as centres of economic activity Many temples were more than centres for worship, learning, social interaction or performing arts. They also created ecosystems with bustling markets; ruling classes donated land and wealth (dāna) to temple deities, held in trust by temple managers who developed community infrastructure (irrigation systems, tanks, etc.) and pilgrim accommodations (dharmaśhālās and chhatrams). Temples provided merchants with credit and funded internal as well as maritime trade. While early periods saw prosperity, the late 1600s witnessed economic stress. Peasants were often left with a small share of their produce after taxes and payments to intermediary parties. This caused many to lose their land and become bonded labourers. Historians suggest that craftspeople and labourers, too, often faced harsh economic conditions. India was still a land of abundance, as testified by many Arab and European travellers, but the wealth was largely concentrated in the hands of the rulers, courtiers, high officials and the merchant class. Frequent warfare, in addition, caused forced displacement of population. At the level of the common people, there were instances of clashes, especially over sacred sites that had been desecrated or destroyed under the rulers’ sanction.

They helped translate important texts like the Upaniṣhads and the Bhagavad Gītā into Marathi, making their philosophy accessible to the people. Some also focused on social organisation and political awareness, similar to the Sikh gurus. As a result, the society acquired a solid cultural foundation, which later helped the Marathas to organise themselves into a political power. By the 17th century, some Maratha chiefs made early attempts at establishing sovereignty, but they proved unsuccessful — until Shivaji rose to power and brought the Marathas together. But who was Shivaji? Foundation of Maratha Power and the Rise of Shivaji In 16 30, Shivaji was born in the Bhonsle clan to Shahji and Jijabai. At the time, Shahji served the Deccan sultanates and was often away from his family. Meanwhile, in his jāgīr at Pune, Shivaji grew up under the watchful eyes of Jijabai and some trusted officials, receiving values and a good education. At this time, the Pune region was deeply affected by constant infighting between the Deccan sultans whom the Marathas served, which caused much hardship for the common people. When he was just 16, Shivaji launched military campaigns, first consolidating his hold over the Pune region by capturing neglected and unoccupied forts and strengthening their defences. His vision of a sovereign kingdom or ‘Swarājya’ grew over the years, extending to political, economic and cultural aspects, which we will explore in this chapter. Fig. 3.5. A painting of Shivaji made in the 1680s (British Museum) Jāgīr: A jāgīr was a piece of land given by a king or ruler to someone (usually a noble or soldier) as a reward for their service.

This was a truly revolutionary step at the time. By com parison, the Bijapur Sultanate (ruled by the Adil Shahi dynasty), maintained merchant ships but did not possess a full- time naval force which could protect the coast; even the Mughal Empire’s use of a navy was very limited. Thus, the Maratha Navy was born, whose exploits became legendary. To protect his people from powerful enemies, Shivaji had recourse to the tactic of guerrilla warfare, which uses small groups of people in a focused way, with speed, surprise, and knowledge of the terrain to defeat bigger armies. His successes soon invited the wrath of the Bijapur Sultanate, which sent the veteran general Afzal Khan to confront him. Shivaji and his advisers managed to convince Afzal Khan to meet him for a one-on-one meeting at the foot of the Pratapgad fort amid thick forests. There, Shivaji killed Afzal Khan, and the Marathas, hidden in the mountains, routed the Khan’s army with guerrilla attacks.

What geographical advantages did they utilise for this? Discuss your findings in groups. Soon afterwards, the Mughal nobleman Shaista Khan invaded Shivaji’s territories with a big army for three years. Finally, with only a few soldiers, Shivaji raided Shaista Khan’s camp at night. The Khan barely escaped from the raid, losing a few fingers, and promptly left Maharashtra. This daring raid resembles the modern-day surgical strike. As a retaliatory action for the three-year-long wave of attacks, Shivaji sacked Surat, a wealthy port city of the Mughal Empire (in present-day Gujarat). There, he obtained enormous treasure worth almost one crore of rupees, an extremely large sum for the time. However, he was careful not to attack religious places and even spared the house of Mohandas Parekh, a charitable man. He sacked Surat again after a few years. These events became so famous that they appeared in the London Gazette, an English newspaper of the time, which conveyed how Shivaji wrote to all European diplomatic agents in Surat, demanding ‘immediate presents of money’, failing which he would ‘return and ruin that city’. The sacking of Surat was a great insult to the might and prestige of the Mughal Empire. Therefore, Aurangzeb sent Jai Singh, a distinguished Rajput general, to defeat Shivaji. Against him, Shivaji had to concede defeat at Purandar Fort (near Pune) and enter into a treaty. He had to give up a sizeable part of his kingdom, and his son Sambhaji had to enter Mughal service.

Incensed at this insult, Shivaji stormed out of the court, following which Aurangzeb put him under house arrest. To escape this, Shivaji devised a strategy — he started distributing gifts to holy men and Mughal generals. The gifts often contained fruits and sweets, packed in big baskets. The guards initially checked them, but soon stopped doing so; expecting this, Shivaji and his son Sambhaji hid themselves in the baskets and made their escape. Aurangzeb could never capture Shivaji again. Fig. 3.8.

He was a master strategist and a true visionary, and within his lifetime, his exploits had become legendary across India and beyond. The Europeans compared him with ancient generals like Alexander, and the Bundela prince Chhatrasal was so inspired by Shivaji’s struggle against the Mughals that he managed to create an independent kingdom of Bundelkhand (divided between present-day Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh). The famous Hindi poet Bhushan specifically came to Maharashtra to meet Shivaji and composed poems in his praise, some of which remain famous to this day. LET’S EXPLORE Pick an event from Shivaji’s life and, with your classmates, stage it as a play. The Marathas after Shivaji Shivaji had two sons — Sambhaji and Rajaram. After Shivaji’s death, Sambhaji became the Chhatrapati. The Marathas were then the only obstacle to total Mughal control of the Deccan. Aurangzeb invaded the Deccan and conquered the Bijapur (or Adil Shahi) and Golconda (or Qutb Shahi) Sultanates. He then captured Sambhaji and, after torturing him brutally, executed him. After this, he captured Raigad, the Maratha capital. After Sambhaji, Rajaram became the Chhatrapati and fled to Gingee (in present-day Tamil Nadu). The Mughal-Maratha conflict thus spread to south India. The Marat has staunchly defended their fortresses and often had the upper hand over the Mughals in battles and skirmishes. Aurangzeb was thus unable to leave the Deccan and died without having succeeded in subduing the Marathas, who emerged as a strong contender to the Mughals. No longer on the defensive, the Marathas led by Tarabai, Rajaram’s queen, made large-scale inroads into Mughal territories, eventually conquering large parts of India. During this rapid expansion, the Marathas themselves under- went a structural transformation. The centralised state from Shivaji’s time gave way to a more decentralised structure,"}

In particular, the Peshwa (a Persian term for ‘prime minister’) wielded great influence, even over the Chhatrapati himself. In particular, Peshwa Bajirao I and his son Nanasaheb Peshwa were instrumental in the pan-Indian expansion of the Marathas. The Marathas brought large parts of India (Fig. 3.11) under their control and generally ruled them well. But with the regional chiefs acquiring more power and autonomy, this also resulted in occasional indiscipline and abuse, in stark contrast with Shivaji’s values. For instance, the Marathas’ ten-year campaign in Bengal inflicted much cruelty and devastation on the common people. In their northward expansion, the Marathas briefly controlled the areas of Lahore, Attock and even Peshawar (in modern-day Pakistan). They fought with the Afghans, and despite suffering a disastrous defeat at Panipat in 1761, they quickly recovered during the time of Peshwa Madhavrao I. Under the leadership of Mahadji Shinde (also known as Mahadji Scindia), they went on to recapture Delhi in 1771, which remained under their control till the British captured it three decades later. In the latter half of the 18th century, the chief rivals of the British in India were the Marathas. Three Anglo-Maratha wars (as they are called) were fought between 1775 and 1818. Owing to the Marathas’ increased internal disunity and the superior organisational and technological abilities of the British, they succeeded in ending the Maratha power. In effect, the British took India from the Marathas more than from the Mughals or any other power. Fig. 3.10.

If needed, secure permission for cutting the trees from the forest and then proceed. Other trees like the mango and jackfruit are also useful, but do not touch them. Because such trees take many years to mature, and the people look after them like their children. If you cut them, will their sorrow ever end?

For instance, this rare Maratha coin known as the ‘Gaṇapatī-Pantapradhān rupee’, minted in the early 19th century by the Patwardhans (generals under the Peshwa), features inscriptions in two scripts — Devanagari and Persian. One side is an invocation to Gaṇapati (Gaṇeśha) while the other declares loyalty to the Peshwa (often referred to as ‘Pantapradhān’ in Marathi). Fig. 3.15. Military administration The Maratha armed forces were divided into three parts — infantry, cavalry and navy. The cavalry was made up of two types of soldiers — the bārgīrs, whose horses and equipment were paid for by the state, and the shiledārs, whose horses and equipment were paid for by the soldiers themselves. In the 18th century, the Marathas also noticed the superiority of European- style disciplined troops and artillery, and they tried to raise and recruit such troops. In particular, Mahadji Shinde had a large European-style army. Swords and lances were the preferred weapons of the Marathas (Fig. 3.16). However, they also used guns in sizable numbers.

Ramachandrapant Amatya, the finance minister of Shivaji, in his work Ādnyāpatra (‘The Royal Edict’) explains, Fig. 3.16. Some of the weapons used by the Marathas. Maritime supremacy As we saw, Shiva ji created a navy to secure the west coast. In the 18th century, Kanhoji Angre guided the Marathas to victory in many naval battles, thanks to a clever use of geography and battle tactics, despite the Maratha ships not being as techno- logically advanced as the European ones. At the time, the main strength of Europeans in India was their navies. They forced Indians to purchase their naval trade passes (cartaz in Portuguese) at a price; any ship without a pass was confiscated. The Marathas challenged this practice and started demanding passes from the Europeans themselves — who showed their frustration by labelling Kanhoji Angre a ‘pirate’! “Forts are the core of the state. In their absence, the land gets devastated in the face of an invasion. Therefore, all the former kings secured the country by building forts.

Judicial system The Marathas had an efficient judicial system, remarkable for its moderation in using capital punishment (the death penalty). The panchāyat (not to be confused with the current- day Panchayat, a governmental body) was a local gathering of officials and prominent men, and the main body that delivered justice.

In places such as Odisha in the 18th century, a network of ferries was maintained for riverine transport. Bridges were built over rivers and small streams. Cultural Revival The Marathas contributed substantially to India’s cultural developments. Shivaji’s vision of Swarājya is evident in his seal, which carried a Sanskrit inscription, a notable departure from the prevalent Persian seals — “This seal (i.e. authority) of Shivaji, the son of Shahji, waxing like the new moon, revered by the world, reigns for the welfare (of the people).” Shivaji also commissioned a treatise called Rājya-Vyavahāra- Koṣha with the aim of promoting the Marathi language; it provided Sanskrit equivalents for the prevalent Persian words used in diplomatic exchanges, as a result of which, the percentage of foreign loanwords in Maratha diplomacy decreased considerably. Shivaji was a devout Hindu who respected other religions while upholding his own. His saffron-coloured flag was adopted by all Marathas. He rebuilt desecrated temples, promoted Sanskrit and Marathi literature, religious institutions, and traditional arts. But perhaps he contributed most to the revival of ancient Indian culture and values by giving people a demonstration that mighty kingdoms and empires could be defeated, and the Marathas could maintain, expand and administer an empire of their own.

And yet, military campaigns were only one factor in India becoming the ‘jewel in the Crown’ of the British Empire — indeed, the empire’s largest colony. The Age of Colonialism Before we get there, we must step back a little in time and consider the phenomenon of colonialism. Its usual definition is the practice where one country takes control of another region, establishing settlements there, and imposing its political, economic, and cultural systems. This is not a recent occurrence: colonialism can be traced to the time of the great empires in the 1st millennium BCE; in the 1st millennium CE, the spread of Christianity and Islam also involved the colonisation of the territories converted to the new faiths. 1440 1490 1540 1590 1640 1498: Vasco da Gama’s arrival at Calicut (Kozhikode) 1560: Establishment of the Inquisition at Goa 1612-1690: The English East India Company establishes trading posts at Surat, Madras, Bombay and Calcutta Fig. 4.2."}

As you will discover in higher grades, European powers — in particular, Spain, Portugal, Britain, France, and Netherlands — established colonies across Africa, Asia, the Americas, Australia and many Pacific islands, after conquering large parts of those regions of the world. Often, the conquests were achieved through military campaigns that involved the massacre or enslavement of native populations. What impelled those nations to undertake such campaigns? Political competition between European powers created a race for territorial expansion and global influence. Territorial expansion had obvious economic advantages: access to new natural resources, new markets and new trade routes — and, often, plunder, as we will see. Converting indigenous popu- lations to Christianity was another powerful motivation.

In many of the colonised regions, resistance built up against the colonisers. The phenomenon of colonialism declined in the mid-20th century, especially after World War II; many factors contributed to rapid worldwide decolonisation, with most colonised countries attaining independence. Here, however, we will focus on the special case of India. Europeans in India India traded with the Greeks and the Romans over two millennia ago. Indian goods — spices, cotton, ivory, gems, sandalwood, teakwood, wootz steel, among other commodities — were highly sought after in the Mediterranean world. Until the 16th century CE, when European powers began sailing to the Indian Subcontinent, India was a vibrant economic and cultural powerhouse. Historical estimates (by economist Angus Maddison, in particular) suggest that India contributed at least one-fourth of the world GDP during this whole period, making it one of the two largest economies globally alongside China (whose contribution was of the same order). It is remarkable that from the 16th century onward, many European travellers to India described her as ‘flourishing’ and noted her manufacturing capabilities, diverse agricultural output, and extensive internal as well as external trading networks. However, this economic prosperity also made India an attractive target for European colonial ambitions. Let us survey Europe’s first colonial powers in India. The Portuguese: commerce and atrocities The Portuguese explorer and navigator Vasco da Gama’s arrival at Kappad (near Kozhikode in Kerala) in May 1498 paved the way for the beginning of European colonisation in India.

The Portuguese captured strategic ports, including Goa (in 1510), which became the capital of their colony in India, as well as several trading posts along the Malabar and Coromandel coasts. The Portuguese implemented a system known as cartaz (pass), requiring all ships in the Arabian Sea to purchase Portuguese permits for navigation. Ships without these permits were seized. This naval dominance allowed them to monopolise the spice trade between India and Europe for nearly a century. Alongside commercial exploitation, the Portuguese presence in western India was characterised by religious persecution. In Goa, they established the Inquisition in 1560, which severely persecuted Hindus, Muslims, Jews, and Christian converts suspected of practising their original faith. Such Inquisition: A tribunal set up by the Roman Catholic Church to judge heretics (i.e. Christians suspected of holding opinions contrary to the Church’s doctrine). Over some 600 years, across Europe many thousands of supposed heretics were tortured and executed. Fig. 4.4.

The Dutch: commerce and competition The Dutch arrived in India in the early 17th century and, unlike the Portuguese, focused primarily on commercial dominance, particularly in the spice trade. They established a Dutch East India Company, with trading posts in various parts of India, including, on the west coast, Surat, Bharuch, Cochin (Kochi), and on the east coast Nagapattinam and Masulipatnam (present- day Machilipatnam). Their most significant presence was in the Malabar region of Kerala, where they displaced the Portuguese from several trading centres. Fig. 4.5.

This battle was a rare instance of an Asian power successfully repelling a European colonial force. The French: colonial ambitions The French entered India later, establishing their first trading post at Surat in 1668 and subsequently at Pondicherry (present- day Puducherry) in 1674, where they established their East India Company (Compagnie des Indes Orientales) and developed ambitious plans to establish a French empire in India. Dupleix, who served as Governor-General of French India from 1742 to 1754, pioneered several colonial strategies that would later be adopted by the British. In particular, he trained Indian soldiers in European military techniques, creating disciplined infantry soldiers known as sepoys. Dupleix also developed the strategy of indirect rule through puppet Indian rulers, who were installed through interventions in local succession disputes. The French colonial ambitions in India were ultimately checked during the Carnatic Wars (1746–1763), a series of conflicts between Britain and France. Despite initial successes under Dupleix, who captured Madras (present-day Chennai) in 1746, the French ultimately lost ground to the British and their colony was reduced to Pondicherry and a few smaller enclaves. Like the Dutch, and unlike the Portuguese, the French colonial powers did not much intervene in Indians’ social and religious life. A rare exception was the destruction in 1748 of Pondicherry’s large Vedapurishwaran temple, ordered by Dupleix on the persistent request of Pondicherry’s Jesuit priests and Dupleix’s own wife, with a view to asserting the dominance of Christianity.

Unlike classic conquests, the British takeover of India was gradual, calculated, and often disguised as commercial enterprise rather than military invasion. The English East India Company was established as a trading company and was granted a royal charter by Queen Elizabeth I, which gave it special powers — to raise a private army, for instance. Nevertheless, its agents initially kept up a pretence of being mere traders, which allowed them, in the 17th century, to establish footholds along India’s coast with minimal resistance: Surat, Madras, Bombay and Calcutta among the first. Local rulers did not mind these trading posts, as they generally welcomed foreign trade (which, let us recall, was a longstanding practice in India). These modest beginnings concealed the Company’s long- term ambitions. LET US EXPLORE Before you read further, have a good look at the painting on the first page of this chapter.

The British were equally skilled at exploiting existing divisions within Indian society: they identified and often encouraged tensions between religious communities, for instance. The Battle of Plassey (1757) exemplifies this approach. When tensions arose between Siraj-ud-daulah, the Nawab of Bengal, and the East India Company officials led by Robert Clive, the latter identified disgruntled elements within the Nawab’s court. Clive hatched a conspiracy with Mir Jafar, the Nawab’s military commander, promising to install him as the new Nawab in exchange for his betrayal. The battle took place at Palashi (Plassey as the British spelt it), some 150 kilometres north of present-day Kolkata. Some French forces assisted the Nawab, but Mir Jafar’s forces — constituting the majority of the Nawab’s army — stood aside, ensuring a British victory despite their smaller number. Even today, ‘Mir Jafar’ in India remains a synonym for ‘traitor’! By positioning themselves as a kingmaker, the East India Company gradually established control over increasingly large territories. In the 19th century, it went a step further and introduced the infamous Doctrine of Lapse, according to which any princely state would be annexed if its ruler died Fig. 4.7.

This deliberately disregarded the Hindu tradition of adoption, which was a legitimate means of succession in Indian royal houses. DON’T MISS OUT In the Indian context, a princely state was a region that remained under the rule of an Indian prince, maharaja or nawab, but which had accepted British protection and guidance in exchange for maintaining internal autonomy. There were hundreds of them, from large ones (such as Hyderabad, Mysore, Travancore or Jammu & Kashmir) to smaller ones. At the time of India’s Independence, there were over 500 princely states, covering about 40 per cent of the Subcontinent. The Doctrine of Lapse led to the annexation of numerous states, contributing to the expansion of the territorial control of the British. This created much resentment in sections of Indian society and contributed to the 1857 Rebellion (to which we return below). Another stratagem (known as ‘subsidiary alliance’) was to install a British ‘Resident’ in the courts of Indian rulers to protect them against internal or external threats; in exchange, they would have to maintain British troops at their own expense and conduct foreign relations only through the British. While appearing to preserve the sovereignty of princely states, the system effectively transferred real power to the British while burdening Indian rulers with the costs of their own subjugation! The ruler of Hyderabad was among the first to enter such an alliance in 1798; several others soon followed. These so-called alliances allowed the British to control vast territories without the administrative costs of direct rule, creating what was called ‘an empire on the cheap’. Once a state entered the system, exiting it was virtually impossible, as any attempt to break free would face overwhelming British military response."}

Devastating famines A few years after its victory at Plassey, the East India Company secured the right to collect revenue in Bengal, Bihar, and Odisha — some of India’s richest regions. Clive described Bengal in particular as ‘the paradise of the earth’. The Company’s agents extracted maximum revenue while investing minimally in governance or development, with devastating consequences for the population. In 1770–1772, coming on top of two years of crop failure, the harsh revenue collection targets imposed by the East India Company in Bengal — requiring farmers to pay a high rate of cash taxes on the produce of their lands, regardless of harvest conditions — caused a catastrophic famine which killed nearly one-third of its population or an estimated 10 million people. In fact, the Company maintained harsh revenue collection targets, even increasing the land tax during the famine. Such cruelty was denounced later not only by Indian personalities but by some British officials and public intellectuals (such as William Digby whom we quoted at the start of this chapter). For instance, a century later, W.W. Hunter, an official, wrote: “While the country every year became a total waste, the English government constantly demanded an increased land-tax. ... All through the stifling summer of 1770 the people went on dying. The husbandmen [farmers] sold their cattle; they sold their implements of agriculture; they devoured their seed-grain; they sold their sons and daughters, till at length no buyer of children could be found; they ate the leaves of trees and the grass of the field. … Day and night a torrent of famished and disease- stricken wretches poured into the great cities.” Paradise: In a religious context, heaven. Here, an ideal, wealthy or perfectly happy place. Such tragic famines were going to recur throughout the British rule in India. During the Great Famine of 1876–1878, for instance, up to 8 million Indians perished, mostly in the Deccan plateau."}

Grain bags on Madras beach, ready for export, while people were dying of hunger in large numbers. Disregarding the severity of the crisis, some Indian traders would hold on to their stocks in the hope of price rise, causing an artificial scarcity, and the British administration continued to export grain to Britain — about one million tonnes of rice alone per year during the three years of the famine (Fig. 4.8). Apart from the factors mentioned above, the British economic policy of ‘free market’, which left prices of commodities free to fluctuate, contributed to the severity of the famines. Thus Lord Lytton, Viceroy of India during the 1876–1878 famine, issued an order that “there is to be no interference of any kind on the part of the Government with the object of reducing the price of food.” At the same time, in 1876, at Fig. 4.9.

Precise numbers of severe famines during the entire British rule vary from a dozen to over 20. According to several Famine Commissions and other reports, it has been estimated that the total number of human victims (‘human’ since millions of cattle and other animals also died) is anywhere between 50 and 100 million — nearly the number of deaths caused by World War II. The British administration did open famine relief camps in some cities (Fig. 4.9), but far too few and with inadequate supplies. Some officials argued that famine relief should be deliberately kept very low; the Famine Commission of 1878–80, for example, stated: “The doctrine that in time of famine the poor are entitled to demand relief ... would probably lead to the doctrine that they are entitled to such relief at all times.” We should note that famines in India had occurred throughout history, caused by droughts, floods, military campaigns and other factors, but never on such a scale. During the colonial era, India, especially rural India, sank into deep poverty and never recovered. The drain of India’s wealth As we saw earlier, economic exploitation of India formed the foundation of British colonial policy. In 1895, the U.S. historian and political scientist Brooks Adams noted: “Very soon after [the Battle of] Plassey, the Bengal plunder began to arrive in London, and the effect appears to have been instantaneous, for all authorities agree that the ‘industrial revolution’ ... began with the year 1760. ... Possibly since the world began no investment has ever yielded the profit reaped from the Indian plunder.” In other words, according to Adams, the Industrial Revolution in Britain, which required much investment, was made possible at least partly by the ‘stolen wealth from India’ (this phrase is by the U.S. historian Will Durant)."}

All these studies showed that the colonisers had extracted many billions of pounds from India.

This was extracted not just through taxes, but by charging Indians for the colonial power’s expenditures on building the railways, the telegraph network, and even on wars!

Indian cotton textiles, in particular, with rich and intricate designs, bright colours, and textures ranging from ultra-thin muslins to richly embossed fabrics were in high demand in many parts of the world. LET’S EXPLORE Do you understand all the terms used above to list and describe Indian textiles? If not, form groups of four or five and try to find out more, then compare your findings with the help of your teacher. British policy imposed heavy duties on Indian textiles imported into Britain while forcing India to accept British manufactured goods with minimal tariffs. Moreover, Britain now controlled most of the sea trade as well as exchange rates, so Indian traders found it difficult to export as earlier. The result was the ruin of Indian textile industry. In the 19th century, India’s textile exports fell sharply, while Britain’s imports into India grew even more sharply. Communities of skilled artisans who had practised their craft for generations were reduced to poverty and forced to return to subsistence agriculture on increasingly overtaxed land. As William Bentinck, then Governor-General of India, observed in 1834, “The bones of the cotton weavers are bleaching the plains of India.” Similar scenarios unfolded for India’s manufactures of iron, steel, paper and other goods. India’s share of the world GDP kept declining throughout the colonial rule, reaching hardly 5 per cent at the time of Independence. In less than two centuries, one of the richest lands of the world had become one of the poorest.

Charles Metcalfe, an acting Governor-General in the 1830s, described the system and its efficiency in this important statement: “The village communities are little republics, having nearly everything they want within themselves. They seem to last where nothing else lasts. Dynasty after dynasty tumbles down; revolution succeeds to revolution; but the village community remains the same. … This union of the village communities, each one forming a separate little state in itself, has contributed more than any other cause to the preservation of the people of India.” The British systematically dismantled these indigenous governance systems, replacing them with a centralised bureaucracy designed primarily to facilitate tax collection and maintain order, rather than promote public welfare. This transformation destroyed centuries-old mechanisms of community decision-making. The introduction of British codes of law disregarded customary laws and practices that had governed Indian communities for generations. While presented as modernisation, this imposition of a foreign system unsuited to India alienated ordinary Indians from the judicial system, creating courts that were expensive, time-consuming, and conducted in a foreign language. Transforming Indian education: creating ‘brown Englishmen’ Education became a powerful tool for the creation of a class of Indians who would serve British interests. In earlier centuries, India had diverse educational traditions — pāṭhaśhālās, madrasās, vihāras, and many forms of apprenticeship learning.

Macaulay. In it, although he admitted that he had “no knowledge of either Sanskrit or Arabic,” he expressed his conviction that European knowledge was vastly superior to India’s: “I have never found one among them [Orientalists] who could deny that a single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia.” Indians, therefore needed British education, whose objective would be to create a class of Indians who would be “Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals, and in intellect.” Although a few prominent British Orientalists argued that Indian students should be left to study in their own languages, Macaulay’s policy gained the upper hand and India’s traditional schools slowly disappeared, while English became a language of prestige associated with the colonial masters, resulting in lasting divisions in Indian society between English-educated elites and the masses. The new education system served multiple colonial objectives. It created a pool of Indian clerks and minor officials who could staff the lower ranks of the colonial administration at a fraction of the cost of British personnel. It also sidelined traditional sources of knowledge and authority, creating generations of Indians disconnected from their own cultural heritage. THINK ABOUT IT What exactly did Macaulay mean when he wrote that “a single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia”?

Reshaping economic structures to serve imperial needs The British transformed India’s economy from a self-sufficient agricultural system supplemented by craft and manufacture production into a supplier of raw materials for British industry and a market forced to buy British goods. Without going into the technical details of this economic transformation, let us take the example of the construction of India’s vast railway network, often cited as a colonial blessing. While the railways did bring people closer together and integrated India’s internal market, it was designed primarily to move raw materials from the interior to ports for export and to distribute British manufactured goods throughout India. Railway routes largely ignored existing trade Fig. 4.15. A steam locomotive of the Madras Railway (one of the companies operating the rail network in British India) in 1860"}

Another purpose was to move armies quickly from their cantonments if they had to fight a distant rebellion or war. Besides, the construction of India’s railways was not a gift from the colonial rulers to India. Most of it was paid for by Indian tax revenue, which means that Indian funded infrastructure that primarily served British strategic and commercial interests, instead of being focused on serving the people’s needs. The same can be said of the telegraph network. Even the administrative costs of colonialism were borne by Indian subjects. The colonial administrative apparatus, military installations, and the lavish lifestyles of British officials in India were all financed by Indian taxation. In short, Indians funded their own subjugation. Early Resistance Movements: Challenging Colonial Authority India was such an enormous source of wealth, natural and human resources for the British that they nicknamed her ‘the jewel in the crown of the British Empire’. And they asserted that India would forever remain part of the British Empire, “on which the sun never sets.” THINK ABOUT IT What is meant by “the sun never sets on the British Empire”? Do you think this was a correct statement? However, almost from the beginning of the British conquest of India, resistance movements manifested to try and repel this self-imposed ‘guest’. We will briefly survey a few such movements, but before we do so, let us have a good look at the map of the British Indian Empire (Fig. 4.16).

The precise motivations of the sannyasis and fakirs have been debated, but over the next three decades they attacked British treasuries and tax collectors. The British called them ‘bandits’, executed some of them and used their superior forces to eventually defeat them. This rebellion later inspired the Bengali writer Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay’s novel Anandamath (1882); it contained the song ‘Vande Mātaram’, which would inspire Indians during the struggle for freedom in the early 20th century and, after Independence, became India’s national song. Tribal uprisings India’s tribal communities faced unique threats as the British expanded into forests and hills, disrupting their traditional way of life. The British described tribals as ‘primitive’, restricted their access to forests and forest produce, sometimes acquiring tribal land or turning it into private property, imposing cash taxes, catching tribals in debt traps, replacing traditional tribal councils with the British legal system and encouraging missionaries to ‘civilise’ and convert tribals to Christianity. Besides, a colonial law categorised hundreds of tribal communities as ‘criminal tribes’, causing them to be unjustly harassed for decades. Some of the above abuse led some tribes to rise in rebellion against the colonial power. Among the first such events, the Kol Uprising (1831–1832) in Chota Nagpur (in present-day Jharkhand) started when the British introduced land policies that favoured outsiders over the original tribal inhabitants. The Kol tribes (which included the Mundas and Oraons, among others) temporarily established their control over significant territory before being defeated by the British forces. The Santhal Rebellion of 1855 –1856, a widespread uprising of the Santhal people across parts of present-day Jharkhand, Bihar and West Bengal, was led by two brothers, Sidhu and Kanhu Murmu, and rebelled against moneylenders and landlords who were taking away their ancestral lands with British support.

European planters forced peasants in the northern parts of Bengal to abandon food crops and, instead, grow indigo plants, as the indigo dye was then in great demand in Europe. From planters to traders, everyone earned huge profits — except the peasants, who were so poorly paid that they got trapped in debt slavery. When they refused to grow indigo, they faced imprisonment, torture, and destruction of their property. Their uprising was directed mostly at the planters, who retaliated by hiring mercenaries to attack the peasants. Their cause was supported by educated Bengalis and the Bengali press; the British authorities were eventually forced to restrict some of the worst abuses.

There are several more notable examples of uprisings across the Subcontinent, which, along with the other aspects of the British rule that we saw earlier, built up to the largest uprising of the 19th century. Let us turn to it. The Great Rebellion of 1857 The British called it the ‘Sepoy Mutiny’. ‘Sepoys’, let us recall, were the Indian soldiers enrolled in the East India company’s British Army; its officers, of course, were almost all British.

For example, they were forbidden from wearing religious marks on their foreheads and were required to shave their beards. The sepoys seized the Vellore fort (in present-day Tamil Nadu) and killed many British officers and troops; the British however crushed the revolt, killing or executing hundreds of sepoys. We should also keep in mind that most sepoys were from agricultural families, which had been suffering great hardship owing to the British policies on land revenue. After decades of increasing frustration, in 1857 rumours spread across northern and central India that rifle cartridges were greased with cow and pig fat, offending the Hindu and Muslim sepoys’ religious sensibilities. At Barrackpore (in present-day West Bengal), the sepoy Mangal Pandey attacked British officers. His execution spread further discontent among the sepoys. In Meerut (in Fig. 4.18.

The military decisions were, however, taken by the commanders. The revolt quickly spread across northern and central India, with sepoys capturing key cities like Kanpur, Lucknow and Jhansi. At Kanpur, rebel forces under Nana Saheb initially agreed to give safe passage to British civilians, but then massacred over 200 men, women and children for reasons that are still debated. The British response was systematic and extremely brutal, beginning with the recapture of Delhi in September 1857, where the British forces conducted house-to-house massacres. At Kanpur, they conducted mass executions designed to strike terror in the population. In a long punitive campaign they burned villages and destroyed crops, causing countless deaths — vastly more than those inflicted by the rebels. According to some historians, the Great Rebellion failed because the sepoys lacked a unified command and a consistent strategy, despite some heroic leaders. The uprising failed, but it marked a turning point, especially in sowing a seed for the idea that foreign domination was unacceptable. The seed would grow early in the 20th century into a full-fledged struggle for freedom, though with different methods. Meantime, in 1858, the British Crown took direct control of India from the East India Company, initiating the period of the British Raj. British policies shifted from aggressive territorial expansion to consolidation of control. The Indian Army was reorganised so as to prevent unified resistance in the future.

Except for a small Indian elite who accepted British rule as inevitable, the Indians suffered the fate of many of the world’s colonised populations: abuse, exploitation, violence and uprooting. At the same time, the colonial rule had some largely unintended consequences. It opened (or re-opened) India to the world and the world to India. The British (and the French to a much smaller extent) were systematic in documenting every aspect of their conquest, from its geography (they conducted meticulous surveys of the Subcontinent). They created impressive lists of all ethnic groups, although the lists were flawed because of the unscientific but prevalent notions of ‘race’ (as genetics has shown, ‘races’ do not exist). They also documented India’s monuments, studying their art and architecture, restoring some of the ruined ones, and initiating the discipline of archaeology. But in the process, they (and other colonial powers) stole thousands of statues, paintings, jewels, manuscripts and other cultural artefacts from India and sent them to European museums or private collections.

In 2024, for the first time, the elderly and people with disabilities could cast their votes from home, and the postal voting option was available for a specific category of voters. Assistive technologies like braille- enabled voter cards and app-based requests for assistance, including wheelchairs and ramps, were also made possible. LET’S EXPLORE Æ Discuss in groups — What role do such measures play in a democracy? Do you know of anyone who benefited from these improved accessibility measures?

LET’S REMEMBER India is a parliamentary democracy where, at the national level, citizens choose representatives for the Lok Sabha (the lower house of the Parliament). They focus on issues affecting the entire country. In addition, voters elect representatives from their constituencies to the legislative assemblies in the state and union territories where they are registered.

Understanding Elections in India — A Very Brief Overview Election to the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies Elections in India are often referred to as the ‘Festival of Democracy’ — a time when citizens exercise their right to choose representatives freely, fairly, and responsibly. We know that India follows a parliamentary system of government where citizens participate in various levels of elections — Lok Sabha (national level), state legislative assemblies (state level) and local bodies (city and village level). The country is divided into 543 constituencies for the Lok Sabha elections. The elected candidates to the Lok Sabha are known as Members of Parliament (MPs), whereas candidates elected to state assemblies are known as Members of Legislative Assembly (MLAs).

DON’T MISS OUT The legislative assembly is called by several names in regional languages, for example, Vidhan Sabha and Niyama Sabha. What is it called in your state? After the voting process is completed, the process of government formation begins. The political party or coalition winning a majority of the seats in the Lok Sabha forms the national government. The leader of this majority typically becomes the prime minister. Similarly, at the state level, the leader of the majority party becomes the chief minister. Coalition: A group of two or more parties working together Fig. 5.22 What's the difference between an MP and an MLA? MPs represent us in the national parliament, while MLAs represent us in our state assembly. Both are chosen through similar electoral processes but work at different levels of governance. If a party or coalition wins a majority of the seats in the Lok Sabha, it forms the national government and its leader becomes the prime minister. In states, if a party or coalition wins a majority of seats in the State Assembly, it forms the government and its leader becomes the state’s chief minister.

Æ Which party does each of them belong to? Æ What are the concerns of the MP and MLA, respectively? Election to the Rajya Sabha The candidates elected to the Rajya Sabha are also known as Members of Parliament (MPs), but they are chosen through indirect elections. Let us revisit the example of Suryodaya School. Imagine that the school is setting up a special council at the school level. If the members of this council are elected by the class representatives, it would be an indirect election. Of the 245 members of the Rajya Sabha, 233 are elected by the elected members of the state legislative assemblies (MLAs), while the President of India nominates 12. Each state is allotted a different number of Rajya Sabha seats based on population. For example, more populous states like Uttar Pradesh have more seats than less populous states like Arunachal Pradesh. The Rajya Sabha is also called the Permanent House — it is never dissolved. A member of the Rajya Sabha has a six-year term. One- third of its members retire every two years, and new members are elected. There is a difference, however, in the voting process. It uses what is called a ‘single transferable vote system’. This is a special way of ensuring that smaller states also get fair representation in the Rajya Sabha.

The citizens of a free country could now make decisions about their own governance. The first important step in this new epoch in the life of our nation was the drafting of the Constitution of independent India. This comprehensive document laid foundational principles for the nation, including that of Universal Adult Franchise which guarantees all adult citizens of the country the right to vote irrespective of their social or economic background, gender, race, or religion. The people of India directly elect their representatives who become members of the Lok Sabha. A majority group from among these elected representatives forms the government. The Parliament is the supreme legislative body of the government (it makes laws for the country). It comprises all elected representatives of the people and controls and guides the work of the government. The government can therefore be seen as functioning with the people’s consent. There have been 17 Lok Sabhas since the first one in 1952. The 18th Lok Sabha was constituted in June 2024. Fig. 6.3.

However, there were also experiences that our freedom fighters and Constitution makers had ― the practical experience gained through participation in British colonial governance structures, even if in a very limited way, that provided familiarity with Parliamentary procedures; the memory of the ancient republics (mahājanapadas); the village panchayats where elders made collective decisions, as we learnt in a previous chapter. Extensive discussions took place during the making of the Constitution regarding whether India should have a bicameral system. It was felt that a single directly elected House would be inadequate to meet the challenges independent India would face. In the spirit of ‘federalism’, it was felt that a Council of States, the Rajya Sabha, was needed. The composition and process of election to the Rajya Sabha were also designed to be different. India practices federalism, which is a form of government where power is distributed between the centre, states, as well as local governments. This system helps to keep the balance between national unity and local interests. Function Each House of the Parliament has a presiding officer to ensure that debates and discussions are conducted in an orderly manner. In the Lok Sabha, the members elect a speaker, who conducts the sessions, allows members to speak, maintains discipline, and ensures that rules are followed.

The Constitution has laid out an elaborate and rigorous process for lawmaking. A law is generally brought into force through an instrument called an act. A bill, which is a draft of a proposed law, is introduced in Parliament and goes through a long and effortful journey before it becomes an act. Given below is the journey of how a bill becomes an act, and ultimately a law, in the case of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 (RTE). “Most people call me RTE. I came into existence in August 2009, though the idea began almost a century before. My roots lie in the Directive Principles of State Policy of the Indian Constitution. Though the Constitution makers wanted me implemented within a decade after Independence, this didn’t happen, leaving countless children without access to education. In the early 1990s, someone argued in court that I was inherently part of the Fundamental Rights in the Constitution, namely, the Right to Life — as education is important to lead a meaningful life. Parliamentary action began some years later with the introduction of the 86th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2002, which mandated — as Article 21A of the Constitution — that the state shall provide free and compulsory education to all children between the ages of 6 and 14 years. Six years later, I was tabled as a bill in the Rajya Sabha. A committee studied me thoroughly and suggested modifications. The major debate concerned funding — new schools, infra- structure, and teachers for millions of children would be costly. By 2008, the MPs determined it was time.

One example is a ‘Money Bill’ that is concerned with financial matters (including taxation, government borrowing, etc.). It is essentially a draft law that can be introduced only in the Lok Sabha; however, the introduction of the bill requires the prior recommendation of the President. 3) Executive accountability The Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers are part of the Union Executive. They are:  primarily responsible for implementing and enforcing laws and overseeing the effective running of the government;  take decisions regarding the day-to-day functioning of the government based on the principles laid out in the Constitution and its laws;  answerable to the Lok Sabha, through mechanisms like the Question Hour which require ministers to justify their actions and decisions. The Question Hour in the Lok Sabha is a select period (typically the first hour of a Parliamentary session) where MPs can ask the ministers questions about government policies and activities. It is a process of the Parliament that holds the Executive ‘accountable’ (i.e., it must justify all actions and decisions). Special committees also hold meetings where ministries have to explain and answer questions about their policies. These committees may include MPs from different political parties."}

The Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers are responsible for running the government. The President appoints the Prime Minister and other ministers, summons the Parliament, and gives assent to bills, among other functions. The Council of Ministers aids and advises the President. However, in specific circumstances, the President can exercise discretionary powers, particularly during political crises, like when no party holds a clear majority in a Lok Sabha election."}

The Prime Minister’s key functions include:  Leading the Council of Ministers  Advising the President  Coordinating the work of different ministries  Shaping national policies The Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers take decisions and run the government. They are collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha. Most of the bills that come to the Parliament for discussion are initiated by the government. A permanent group of officials — called ‘civil servants’ — help in implementing laws and policies. These officers, often called administrators or bureaucrats, work under the direction of ministers and ensure that government departments function smoothly.

{"id": "class 8__sst__p176__c1", "text": "154 Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 8 Part 1 The Judiciary — Role of Checks and Balances The Judiciary is the branch of government that is responsible for interpreting and applying the laws of the land, including in specific cases of disputes. The Judiciary functions through a system of courts and plays a pivotal role in maintaining the democratic nature of society and governance. The Judiciary acts as the custodian of the Constitution, ensuring that all branches of the government operate within the principles and parameters enshrined in the Constitution. It keeps a check on the effective functioning of society and institutions of the government by interpreting laws, resolving disputes, and safeguarding fundamental rights. The Constitution not only describes how the Legislature and Executive are given power to govern the country, but it also lists the specific responsibilities of these organs. To ensure that the powers of the Legislature are used properly and responsibilities are followed, the Judiciary is given the unique and critical responsibility of checking that the laws passed by Parliament have not violated the Constitutional framework. Similarly, if a violation of the Constitution occurs when the laws are implemented by the Executive, the Judiciary again has the power to step in. Just as the Parliament functions through its Legislature and the Executive arms, the Judiciary functions through its Courts. In this chapter, we have explored how the organs within the Parliament balance making of the law and executing it, and how the Judiciary checks these actions. These are all examples of the separation of powers and the system of checks and balances among the Legislature, the Executive, and the Judiciary, ensuring that no one organ becomes too powerful.

For example, how does the Legislature question the actions of the Executive? How does the Judiciary make sure that laws and government actions respect the Constitution? Do you think there might be ways in which the actions of the Judiciary itself are reviewed? Æ Can you find examples where the Judiciary has asked lawmakers to review a law? Can you find any instances when the implementation of a law has been questioned by the Judiciary? We will learn more about the Judiciary in a later chapter. Legislative and Executive Functions at the State Level As discussed, the Union Government has a Parliament with legislative and executive functions. Similarly, each state has its own legislature and executive, called its ‘State Assembly’. Just as the Parliament has Members of Parliament (MPs) who make laws, there are Members of Legislative Assembly (MLAs) who formulate laws on subjects that are on the ‘State List’ and on the ‘Concurrent List’. Union List, State List, and Concurrent List The Constitution has lists that help to clarify the areas on which the Union and State governments can exclusively legislate, called the Union List and the State List, respectively. There is also a Concurrent List that has subjects on which both the Union and State governments can legislate. However, in the case that the Union government legislates on a subject in the Concurrent List, the state government is bound to follow it. In the case of RTE, for example, the Act is applicable all over India even though education is in the Concurrent List.

What implications does this have for the role that the Rajya Sabha is expected to play? Some of these can include regular absenteeism of members, non- cooperative conduct or communication of members, reduced quality of important debates, and disruptions of the Question Hour. The Parliament typically meets three times a year. These meetings are called ‘sessions’ ― Budget Sessions, Monsoon Sessions and Winter Sessions. Each of these has ‘sittings’, where the Parliament meets to deliberate upon proposed laws, discuss important matters of governance, and seek explanations from the Executive on its decisions and actions.

It had to be created or done with devotion. The tools (a type of technology) used were worshipped; this tradition continues as 9iĜhwaNarmÃ pĬMÃ or Âyudha pĬMÃ. So, creating products involved a unique blend of NalÃ (art) and YidyÃ (knowledge). Knowledge was passed on from generation to generation, and also built on. The Ĝhilpa ĜhÃstras are ancient texts that contain detailed design guidelines on sculptures, paintings, buildings, wooden items, and jewellery. For example, texts on sculpture prescribe exact specifications regarding postures, colours, measurements, and proportions of figures. DON’T MISS OUT Generations of families of sculptors have worked on constructing India’s temples over centuries. They used their skills without expecting to see the finished outcome. They pursued excellence, considering work as worship by practising regularly and learning new techniques. Fig. 7.9. Re-creation of a 5th-century stitched ship Stitched shipbuilding Indians used a unique stitching technique dating back over 2000 years to make ships and boats, which they used to conduct maritime trade and cultural exchanges across the Indian Ocean. The technique involved stitching wooden planks together using cords instead of nails, which made them flexible and helped the ships navigate the Indian Ocean with ease."}

Just as Ratna would have required money to take the land on lease, buy the furniture and kitchen equipment, etc. These are all called ‘capital’ — money plus human-made resources that are used to produce goods and services. Capital is essential to a manufacturing unit or a services sector enterprise. But where do businesses get the capital?

However, the funds were insufficient for Ratna to start the business, so she took a loan from the bank to meet the shortfall. She paid interest along with a part of her loan amount over a period of time. Similarly, large companies require a lot of money to expand their business; hence, they raise money from the general public through the stock market. The stock market is a special type of market where shares are bought and sold. Large companies raise money from the public by offering them a share of the profits, called a dividend. In other words, big businesses can raise money or financial capital through such a market and can sell shares of their business. You will learn the exact mechanism of how this works in the higher grades. LET’S EXPLORE Identify a factory in your region. Find out how much capital may have been invested in the construction of the factory (you may provide an estimate). What kinds of equipment does the factory use to create its finished products?

Write its related information on a piece of paper, such as its name, what it does, and how it works, sketches or drawings of what it would look like, and so on. Discuss with your classmates. How are the Factors Connected? The factors — land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology are combined to produce goods and services, and the proportion of each factor used depends on the product. For example, output from the agriculture, construction, and handicraft sectors relies more on labour and thus is labour- intensive, while semiconductor chips or satellites require more capital, specialised machinery, and are capital-intensive. These factors complement each other and are interconnected; in case of some missing or misused factors, production can become inefficient or can be halted. However, in some cases, new techniques can change the proportion used and output. For instance, increased machine use in agriculture can lower dependence on labour. Similarly, 3-D printing can help revive the dying art forms in textiles by producing handloom products at a large scale to serve the market. The production inputs are available at different geographic locations. Businesses can procure them from these varied locations and combine the inputs to produce goods and services. Thus, the geographic interconnectedness provides businesses with access to varied inputs. However, production activities sometimes face severe supply chain challenges. The supply chain is a network of individuals, organisations, resources, activities and technology that are involved in the production and sale of goods."}

{"id": "class 8__vocational education__p3__c1", "text": "Foreword The National Education Policy 2020 envisages a system of education in the country that is rooted in Indian ethos and its civilisational accomplishments in all domains of human endeavour and knowledge, while at the same time preparing the students to constructively engage with the prospects and challenges of the twenty-first century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured the students’ inherent abilities and touching upon all the five planes of human existence, the pañchakośhas, in the foundational and the preparatory stages have paved the way for the progression of their learning further at the middle stage. Thus, the middle stage acts as a bridge between the preparatory and the secondary stages, spanning three years from Grade 6 to 8. The NCF-SE 2023, at the middle stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages, including at least two languages native to India, science, mathematics, social science, art education, physical education and well-being, and vocational education, promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy—a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establishing conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject experts, pedagogues, and practising"}
{"id": "class 8__vocational education__p4__c1", "text": "iv teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. Kaushal Bodh, the activity book of vocational education for Grade 8, is one of these. Its content comprises projects related to three work forms— life forms, machines and materials, and human services. The projects will help students to develop knowledge, skills, attitude and values alongside ecological sensitivity, gender sensitivity, digital skills, and life skills. For all practical purposes, it has, to my mind, succeeded in its curricular goals: first, to foster natural curiosity among students through a proper selection of project; and second, develop among them the core competencies, such as communication, creativity, critical thinking, and green skill and vocational skills, such as application of tools, and procedures for design and developing products by intelligently designing various activities, thereby seamlessly integrating content and pedagogy within meaningful contexts. However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries, laboratories and workshops play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this activity book and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years.

{"id": "class 8__vocational education__p5__c1", "text": "About the Book Kaushal Bodh, the activity book of vocational education for Grade 8 is developed in alignment with the vision of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023. In the NCF-SE 2023, work has been categorised under three broad forms: Work with Life Forms, Work with Machines and Materials, and Work in Human Services. The intent at this stage is to provide vocational exposure to the students through a wide range of activities categorised into three forms of work. To achieve this, students are expected to take up nine projects across Grade 6 to 8, i.e., three projects in each grade and one from each form of work. Curricular goals, competencies, and learning outcomes have been the guiding principles while developing the Activity Book. The following Curricular Goals (CG) given in the Activity Book cover a range of competencies. CG-1: Develops in-depth basic skills and allied knowledge of work and their associated materials or procedures; CG-2: Understands the place and usefulness of vocational skills and vocations in the world of work; CG-3: Develops essential values while working across areas; and CG-4: Develops basic skills and allied knowledge to run and contribute to a home. The activity book contains six illustrative projects, two for each form of work, intended to cover the above curricular goals. The choice of projects is left entirely to schools. One project may be taken up by students or preferably, the school can design other projects based on local considerations. The NCF-SE 2023, and indeed this activity book, encourages schools to select projects based on local considerations and availability of resources. Annexure 1 provides a template for designing a project other than those in the book. The illustrative projects are described as follows: Project 1 is on developing Hydroponics: Growing Plants without Soil. Students will engage in establishing and maintaining hydroponic units in school. They will draw on their learning in Science classrooms"}
{"id": "class 8__vocational education__p6__c1", "text": "vi about conditions for plant growth and extend this understanding to scientific alternatives. They will learn about environmentally friendly practices that can be used for plant propagation. Project 2 is on Feeding and Caring for Farm Animals. Students will engage with animals to develop sensitivity towards their well-being. They will appreciate the diversity of domesticated animals that support human life. This project will enhance their observational skills related to animal behaviour and its interpretation. It will also instill a sense of care and the importance of preserving the well-being of animals. Project 3 is on Working with Wood and Bamboo. In this project, students will explore various techniques used for working with wood and bamboo. They will learn to use tools and materials to create functional or artistic items, fostering creativity, problem-solving, and technical skills. This project will encourage innovation and creative thinking, preparing students for potential careers in design. Project 4 is on Home Automation. It will introduce students to the fundamentals of electronics and programming. They will learn to automate simple systems in their surroundings. This project will enhance their technological proficiency, creativity, and logical thinking. Project 5 is on Water Audit for Water Management. Students will engage with real-life data to learn how to draw conclusions and make simple predictions. They will collect primary data using estimations based on scientific principles. They will also engage with secondary data, learning how to acknowledge sources. This project will develop sensitivity towards the needs of all as well as a sense of environmental stewardship. Project 6 is on Advertising for Small Businesses. In this project, students will reflect on the role of advertisements in our life. They will identify elements of advertisements to understand both the marketing and ethical dimensions. They will learn about small businesses and make advertisements for them using different media. This project will develop discernment to review advertisements and other media of communication for veracity. As the culmination of the work done through the year related to vocational education, a Kaushal Mela will be held at the end of the year to both showcase the products students have created and the services they have learnt. It will also be an opportunity for students to share"}

Planning, being an important outcome of vocational education, a section is devoted to helping students plan and design the Kaushal Mela. Finally, annexures include a project planning template, competencies and learning outcomes to be achieved in Grade 8, suggestive projects in each of the forms of work in some detail, and mapping of learning outcomes with time required for each of the illustrative projects. Cross-cutting themes, such as Indian Knowledge Systems, values, heritage, gender sensitivity, and inclusion have been integrated into all the projects. Reflective and thought-provoking questions included under different activities are engaging and they promote joyful learning along with assessment as and for learning. Students are provided opportunities to do different things, record small successes, take and give feedback, work with peers, try and re-try, answer-questions, reflect, in short, and experience the values related to work. Illustrations have been designed depicting the context to enhance learning. In-text questions are also included to assess comprehension of the activities. The end of the project questions given in ‘Think and Answer’ are designed to encourage critical thinking, reasoning, responding, and analysing. Students can access the additional resources provided in the Quick Response (QR) code for each project. We sincerely hope that the students will enjoy doing these projects and that these will help in developing the desired and intended competencies.

{"id": "class 8__vocational education__p10__c1", "text": "Note for School Heads and Teachers Teachers are pivotal to achieving the goals set out in the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 introduces vocational education as a distinct subject starting in Grade 6. The purpose of this subject is to promote ‘learning by doing’, ‘dignity of labour’, and the development of vocational capacities through exposure to a wide range of work. Successful implementation will aid in developing responsible and confident adults who value all professions. Vocational Education in schools also offers a robust medium for holistic learning by offering students opportunities to apply conceptual learning in other curricular areas to real-life situations. In Grade 8, students will take up one project in each of the ‘Forms of Work’. The sequence of these projects is not important, so long as all the projects are completed within the academic year. These projects can be taken up at the same time or one after the other. Groups of students may also take up different projects, which depends on the nature of the project and other factors, such as the number of students, resources available, and so on. Please note that it is important to identify concepts across curricular areas that students need to know (e.g., seed germination for agriculture related projects in life forms) and ensure that they have been covered before starting the project. In this Activity Book, the projects are designed as per the Learning Outcomes for Vocational Education in Grade 8. The focus is on the following: 1. Using physical tools/equipment for carrying out different processes to perform authentic tasks. 2. Gaining clarity about what is to be done and reaching the final outcome through breaking down the task into smaller activities. 3. Understanding how to prepare materials and use tools and equipment, while following safety measures and protocols. 4. Connecting the activities done in school to the world of work. 5. Assessing work done in terms of quantity and quality. 6. Applying what is learnt in school to daily life. 7. Working collaboratively in groups while ensuring individual participation in each activity."}
{"id": "class 8__vocational education__p11__c1", "text": "xi In doing the above, students will be able to develop values related to work, particularly respect for all work. They will realise the importance of the dignity of labour, which means that no work is considered superior and therefore, no work or person should be discriminated against on any basis. The projects in the Activity Book are illustrative. Schools can choose to take up any one or design their own projects from each form of work. Annexure 1 provides guidelines for designing a project in alignment with curricular goals, competencies and learning outcomes. Annexure 3 has details of five additional projects in each form of work. Thus, for each form of work, schools may (i) select one project from each form of work; (ii) design their own projects; and (iii) further detail out any one of the additional projects given in the Activity Book. Pedagogy and Assessment Projects comprise a set of activities that are generally expected to be completed in a group or individually, as required. Resources for projects (e.g., tools, equipment, materials, use of workspaces, etc.) and resource persons or master instructors (e.g., mechanics, farmers, craftspersons, artisans, persons working in technology, and experts in the field) must be drawn from the community. Exposure visits and interactions with professionals are built into the project to enable students to observe and understand work in real settings. The total time allotted to vocational education is 110 hours or 165 periods in one academic year, excluding time for assessment, school events, bagless days and similar activities (Section 4.3 of the NCF-SE 2023). These periods may be distributed across the week as two blocks of two periods on week-days and one period on Saturday. Each project is expected to be completed in about 30 hours (approximately 55 periods of 40 minutes each). This duration is to ensure a long-term engagement that allows students to complete a set of interrelated activities. It also gives them time for trial and error, to try out things differently, and to extend their learning into other activities."}
{"id": "class 8__vocational education__p12__c1", "text": "xii The focus of the projects must be creativity and demonstration of skills, and the process of ‘doing’ rather than the ‘product’ or outcome. Working in groups and observing people with expertise is important to foster an appreciation for teamwork, creativity, sensitivity, persistence, and other important values related to work. Students must be active throughout, as they take up activities that are directly connected to real life and the world of work. They must be able to integrate learning from other curricular areas into the projects. Prevalent biases must be addressed, for example, by assigning work roles to diverse gender and to students from all social groups. All students must participate in all activities. To ensure the participation of divyang students, projects can be adapted or an entirely different project may be developed. The activity book is designed to enable continuous assessment by teachers, as well as self and peer-assessment by students. The questions and formats for recording require students to assess their own progress, share their learning and reflections, and record their answers as they move from one activity to the next. Students must also maintain a portfolio in order to help them see their own progress, and record the processes and products related to the projects. It may contain any work done by students, including additional notes, presentations, sketches or photographs (besides those in the activity book) related to the project, and products they have created. Assessing the inculcation of values related to work (e.g., initiative, persistence and focus, responsibility, discipline, eye for detail, curiosity and creativity, empathy and sensitivity, and willingness to do physical work) is particularly important. Students must be observed while at work to assess the same. Checklists and rubrics that outline specific behaviours and attitudes related to work values may be developed by the teachers. Annexure 2 contains the competencies to be developed across the middle stage and the learning outcomes to be achieved in Grade 8."}
{"id": "class 8__vocational education__p13__c1", "text": "xiii While this is true for all subjects, the role of feedback is particularly important in Vocational Education. Students must be encouraged and motivated by recognition of their work and their creativity. This approach ensures that all students are able to complete their work successfully through ongoing guidance, which in turn is motivating. Summative assessment for Grade 8 can, for example, comprise a viva voce, presentation, role-play, simulation, group discussion, and the review of students’ responses to prompts or questions in the activity book. If you wish to use a paper–pencil test, it could include situational questions, concept maps, flowcharts, questions related to learning from visits, and multiple choice questions. Each project also has a set of questions in the last section. These questions address key aspects of learning and concepts that are strengthened while doing the activities. To reiterate, the focus must be on assessing capacities and understanding of processes. Weightage to the theoretical aspects is suggested as 20 per cent and 80 per cent for the practical aspects. A suggested weightage and marking scheme for assessment and evaluation is given below: Mode of Assessment Weightage Written Test 10% Oral Presentation/Viva Voce 30% Activity Book 30% Portfolio 10% Teachers’ Observations during Activities 20% Criteria for Project Selection The activity book is meant for students, and therefore ‘speaks’ to them. There are various components in each project, as indicated by the headings of sections (please refer to Annexure 1). These components are aligned with the competencies defined for Vocational Education in the NCF-SE 2023 (please refer to Annexure 2).

{"id": "class 8__vocational education__p14__c1", "text": "xiv The projects in this activity book are not mandatory, therefore schools are free to choose any one of these from each form of work or design an entirely different project. Students must also be encouraged to come up with ideas for projects. If the school decides to choose a project other than those in the Activity Book, the following must be kept in mind for all the forms of work: 1. Is the project appropriate for students in Grade 8? 2. Does the project help students use learning from other subjects? 3. Is the project related to the work the students see around them? 4. Will the students be able to interact with persons who are experts in the work related to the project? 5. Will the students be able to get hands-on experience? 6. Will students be able to take up different kinds of activities within the project? 7. Will students find the activities within the project challenging and interesting? 8. Will students learn something they can use at home? 9. Will it develop the values related to work, particularly the dignity of labour? 10. Will the project help students acquire vocational capacities for their daily living (e.g., using technology, consciousness of environmental concerns and sustainability, taking care of oneself, doing small tasks at home, and the like)?

Since the purpose of vocational education in the middle stage is to provide vocational exposure to students, and till such time that teacher education programmes offer specialisation in vocational education, existing teachers will take up this subject in the Middle stage (Grade 6 to 8), with the support of resource persons/master instructors. A teacher of any subject can take the lead in organising activities for projects in which they have some understanding and expertise. The Head of the School may nominate a “Teacher Coordinator” among the existing teachers to coordinate and schedule the activities of different projects to be undertaken at the Middle stage. Safety Measures Due care must be taken to ensure safety at all times. Safety measures must be demonstrated to students, who must, in turn, also demonstrate their understanding of how to keep themselves and others safe. Where necessary, use of certain tools and materials by students may be supervised in small groups. Due safety during field visits, ranging from transportation to orientation of resource persons must receive necessary attention. Internet safety or cyber safety is critical when students are accessing the Internet or using AI tools.

{"id": "class 8__vocational education__p16__c1", "text": "Note for Students Dear Students, This activity book will help you learn about different kinds of work and how to do work yourself. When you think about work, you must remember two things: (i) all work is important; and (ii) people work not only to make a living, but also to make life more joyful and interesting. In daily life, you see people doing various kinds of work. Some of the work is related to running a household while some is related to earning a living. How to use the Activity Book? Read through the introduction of the project to get an idea of what you will be doing. Materials Needed Gather all the materials listed at the beginning of each activity. Follow the Steps 1. Each activity has clear, numbered steps. Follow them to complete each task. Take your time and make sure you understand each step before moving on. Take notes during field visits or interaction with experts. 2. Complete all the questions and tables given in the activity book; this will help you to both learn and check your understanding. Check Your Work After completion of the task, reflect on what you have learnt and what else you want to learn. Questions have been included to help you both think and write about what you are doing. Write in your own words, Vocational education prepares you to deal with practical things related to daily life and understand the world of work. This will happen through projects that you will do in school. These projects will give you an opportunity to work with your hands, work in groups with your peers, and learn the skills which help you become self-dependent in life."}

Make sure you have completed all the steps and check your answers. If the space in the activity book is not enough, please use a different notebook or loose sheets, which you can add to the portfolio. Ask for Help If you are unsure about any part of an activity, do not hesitate to ask a teacher, parent, or peers for help. Ask as many questions as needed if something is unclear. Collaboration and discussion can make learning more fun and effective. You can also get help from Internet searches or using AI tools. AI tools make our tasks easy by helping us find things or do something quickly. Some examples of AI tools are ChatGPT, tools for translation or for finding information about something. Please note that AI is not necessary for your projects; you can use it if you want. Take Short Breaks Do not rush through the activities. If you start feeling tired, take a short break during the activities. Be Creative Some activities may have open-ended questions or ask for your creative inputs. Let your imagination flow and write about your ideas and experiences. Stay Positive Learning new things can be challenging. Stay positive and remember that practice makes you perfect.

{"id": "class 8__vocational education__p26__c1", "text": "Kaushal Bodh — Grade 8 4 Farmers put a lot of effort into growing healthy food in the shortest period. But as the world population grows, the demand for food also increases. More and more land is needed to meet this demand — this land is taken from forests, leading to deforestation. Deforestation leads to the loss of biodiversity and contributes to climate change. Another challenge is that, as the same land is used over the years to grow plants, it loses its nutrients, which is known as soil degradation. Heavy use of fertilisers to compensate for the loss of nutrients further degrades the soil quality due to the chemical component of most fertilisers. Besides loss of nutrients, erosion caused by wind and rain, water pollution due to industrial drainage, land degradation due to mining activities and even excessive water for irrigation, all contribute to the reduction of the land available for farming and the quality of produce. The Government of India is encouraging farmers to use hydroponics through the Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare. Technologies like hydroponics, and aeroponics in which plants are not in direct contact with soil, are being promoted under this mission. In India, nearly 33% of the Total Geographical Area (TGA) is affected by soil degradation. This means we are losing our fertile farming land. Nearly 109 million hectares of land is facing declining soil quality. The focus of agricultural scientists, nutritionists, engineers and environmental experts has been to help farmers adopt sustainable farming practices. Sustainable farming aims to produce food that is healthy for humans with minimum negative impact on the environment. The term hydroponics is derived from the Greek words ‘hydro’, that is, water, and ‘ponos’, that is, labour or toil. Hydroponics is a method of growing plants in a nutrient- rich water solution instead of soil (Figures 1.1 and 1.2). Plants in a hydroponic unit receive nutrients directly from the water"}

Similarly, recirculating (reusing) water and fertilisers, controlling climatic parameters like temperature, humidity and light for photosynthesis and maximising plant growth is possible in hydroponics (for example, the hydroponic unit could be placed in a polyhouse). Hydroponics is also used for growing crops in cities, which is known as “urban farming”. What will I be able to do? At the end of the project, you will be able to: 1.

Some key precautions to be followed while working in hydroponic farming are as follows: 1. Safety while using tools and materials: Wear gloves when handling tools, and pay attention during demonstrations to understand the correct techniques for using tools. Take special care when using sharp tools and power-driven machines like a drill machine and a submersible pump. 2. Safety while using electrical gadgets: Be careful while working with gadgets like aerators and submersible pumps. Work only under the supervision of the teacher or expert. Internet safety: Ask your teacher for help while using the Internet. Be careful not to upload or download anything without checking. Do not share personal information with anyone. What do I need to know before I start? You have learnt in Science as well as in Vocational Education that plants require certain essential conditions to grow. Air, temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, nutrients, soil and water are necessary for the growth of plants. Try to use waste materials for your project. So, use scrapped plastic bottles and cups, Styrofoam sheets, and pipes to build hydroponic systems. Now, reflect on whether these needs can be fulfilled even without soil.

Can we replace soil and ensure conditions are fulfilled? Germination of seeds Seeds absorb water and start the germination process. Yes. Seeds can be soaked in water to germinate just like we make sprouts. Physical support for plants Roots hold soil to provide support to plants. In hydroponics, plants are placed on floating sheets or net pots to hold them above water, thus providing the required support. Sunlight for growth Plants absorb sunlight to make their food through photosynthesis. Sunlight and artificial light are both used in hydroponics. Nutrients for plant growth Plant roots absorb minerals in the soil. In hydroponics, minerals (nutrients) are added to water in the required quantity and absorbed by plant roots. Any other specific need Plants or crops are sown directly in the soil with the addition of compost or fertilisers. Growth media are used instead of soil. Some common growth media are coco coir, coco peat, gravel, sand, red-brick or clay, pebbles, rockwool, and vermicompost. In addition to the above, plants also need help from microbes. You are probably aware that microbes are organisms that cannot be seen without a microscope. Microbes do multiple things useful for plants, like breaking down complex organic matter into simpler compounds so that plant roots can absorb them easily, suppress diseases and help in communication with neighbouring plants. However, care needs to be taken to ensure that only microbes that help plants grow are added to the water."}

What will you do differently next time? ........................................................................................................................... ........................................................................................................................... Activity 5: Building a hydroponic system using Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) In the DWC hydroponic method, plant roots are suspended in standing water. The DWC system uses horizontal space. Vertical stacking of water tubs is complex due to the heavy load of the water reservoir. So, what if we take water near the root zone instead of placing the roots in standing water? This allow you to increase the number of plants while using lesser amount of water and utilise the vertical space. In this method, plants stand in a shallow stream of water. Water flows in the form of a thin film containing plant nutrients. As water continuously flows in a stream, NFT does not require an air pump to increase dissolved oxygen. You can build an NFT system in different shapes and sizes, like horizontal or vertical stacking of pipes, a-frame or pyramid stacking, etc. You can select the shape based on space, material and convenience.

Poultry birds, cattle, buffaloes, bulls, sheep, yaks, mithun (gayal), pigs and camels are reared by farmers for food, wool, transportation, and to provide labour for farm operations. They are also crucial for soil fertility as they provide organic manure. Domestic animals on a farm are collectively called livestock and comprise a large part of farmers’ wealth, and contribute regularly to their income. Besides farmers, herders specialising in one kind of livestock, for example, shepherds, goatherds, swineherds, and cowherds, also have a large number of livestock. Besides the economic benefits, animals respond to love and care, and become a part of the family, even providing emotional support to individuals or families. Therefore, their care is an essential part of the farmers’ work. Nutritious food, clean water, proper shelter, and vaccination are necessary for the good health of livestock. Paintings in the Bhimbetka caves in Madhya Pradesh show evidence of the relationship between humans and animals. Decorated bulls, grazing animals, and human riding horses and animals suggest that domesticated animals have been our companions for more than 10,000 years (Figure 2.2).

Apart from a caring approach, the environment in which animals live also plays an important role in the well-being of livestock. For example, research by scientists has concluded that playing music in cow sheds has a calming effect. The result is an increase in milk production. This is due to the masking of noises (e.g., of farm machinery). Activity 2: Field visit to a veterinary clinic/animal healthcare centre Just like humans, domestic animals have healthcare requirements. Animal healthcare centres or veterinary clinics provide necessary healthcare services to livestock. Veterinary practitioners also need specialised training and certification. The Veterinary Council of India (VCI) is the nodal authority that decides how veterinarians should be prepared to work with animals. Visit a veterinary centre in a village or nearby town to learn standard healthcare practices and treatment required by livestock. You can also invite a veterinary doctor or practitioner to your school to learn about basic healthcare requirements. India ranks number one in the world for its cow and goat population. We are the largest producer of milk and also have the highest diversity among cows, with 43 registered native breeds. Breeds indicate various types of animals within the same kind, e.g., Kasargod cattle from Kerala are a dwarf breed that grows up to an average height of 1 metre (Figure 2.6).

Select at least two animals for this activity. You need to work in a group of 5–6 students. You can visit a nearby farmer/animal owner or ask them to visit your school with their animal(s). The following should be considered while selecting the animal(s): 1. It is better to choose small and friendly animals that are easy to handle, such as a goat or sheep, instead of a bullock, buffalo or cow. Do remember that bucks/bully goats or male goats are more aggressive than females. 2. Ensure that the teacher/farmer/animal owner or a veterinary professional is present before approaching the animal. 3. Stand at a distance from the animal, and take care not to stand behind the animal. 4. You will do a visual observation and check the respiration rate. Visual Observations of the Animal Visual observations will help you assess the health of the animal without any medical tests. Observe the following: 1. Eyes: Should be bright, moist and clean. 2. Nostrils: Should be clean, wet and without any discharge. 3. Skin: Should be glossy, clean and free from parasites (e.g., tick, mite, lice, etc.). 4. Behaviour: Should be alert, inquisitive, and interested in its surroundings. 5. Appetite: Should have a good appetite and no signs of diarrhoea. Checking Respiration Rate 1. Respiration rate is recorded with visual observation. You will need to identify the flank region of the animal (Figure 2.8).

Activity 5: Estimating the weight of farm animals Body weight is a significant health indicator for livestock, just like humans. It affects feed requirements, disease treatment, production levels (milk, eggs, and weight gain), and selling price. You can use a regular weighing scale for small animals, like poultry, whereas a suitable scale may not always be available for larger animals, like cattle, goats, camels, and horses. To solve this problem, you can estimate their body weight by measuring their dimensions. You already know the connection between volume, density, and weight. Using these, you can calculate weight with a simple formula: Weight=Volume×Density This simple equation is the basis for calculating of the weight of a farm animal. You will need to take body measurements of the farm animal (Figures 2.9 and 2.10). Now follow the steps given below to calculate the weight of an animal using the formula: 1.

{"id": "class 8__vocational education__p69__c1", "text": "Feeding and Caring for Farm Animals 47 Activity 6: Preparing a feeding chart Like humans, livestock also need carbohydrates, protein, fat, minerals, and vitamins for their growth and productivity. A proper feeding schedule and providing quality feed are important for the health of animals. The feed requirement of an animal depends on the type of digestive system (ruminant versus non-ruminant), feeding habits, and productivity. Ruminant livestock (cow, buffalo, goat, sheep) have four chambers in the stomach. Ruminants can digest low-quality grass compared to non- ruminant (horses, pigs, poultry) animals. Cattle and buffalo prefer grass as feed, while goats and camels prefer tender leaves from shrubs and weeds. Feed requirement is determined by weight and Dry Matter (DM) requirement. You have already estimated the weight of two animals. DM is simply the non-water portion of animal feed. Generally, DM equal to 2–3 per cent of the animal’s live body weight is required by an adult animal everyday. The feed requirement of animals is directly related to their weight (Table 2.8). In an earlier activity, you had estimated the weight of two animals. Table 2.8: Feed requirements of goat Weight of the animal DM = 3% of the weight of the animal Concentrate feed = 25% of DM Total fodder (Wet+dry) = 75% of DM Dry fodder = 25% of total fodder Green fodder = 75% of the total fodder Actual green fodder requir- ement 32 kg goat, i.e., 32000g 32000g×3% = 960g/day 960×25% =240g 720g 720×25% =180g 720×75% = 540g 540×5 = 2735g Let us assume one of the animals was a goat weighing 32 kg. • It will need 3% DM per day, that is 960 g per day. • To ensure the goat’s health, 25% of the total DM should be from protein-rich concentrate and 75% from green and dry fodder."}
{"id": "class 8__vocational education__p70__c1", "text": "Kaushal Bodh — Grade 8 48 • Fodder can be divided into dry fodder (25%) and green fodder (75%). • Green fodder has 80% water content. So, the quantity in Table 2.8 is increased by 5 times. Otherwise, the goat feels hungry just like you feel hungry after having only fruit juice or rice in your meal. Therefore, the total DM requirement and feeding options will be as illustrated in Table 2.8. • The feed should be given to the goat 2–3 times daily in equal quantities. For example, at dawn, midday, and early evening. Following this example, calculate the feeding requirement of your selected animals. The first step is to estimate the weight, then the DM requirements, and then different feeds, such as concentrate, green and dry fodder. Using a Mobile Application for Animal Feed Calculation You can also use mobile applications designed to calculate the feeding requirements of farm animals. The Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) has developed a ‘feeding chart’ mobile application for milking cows and buffaloes in collaboration with the National Institute of Animal Nutrition and Physiology (NIANP). Similarly, the Central Institute for Research on Goat (CIRG) has developed a mobile application for goat farming. Prepare a feeding chart for at least two animals using Table 2.9. Compare the actual feed given by the animal owner versus your calculated feeding need (Table 2.9).

{"id": "class 8__vocational education__p71__c1", "text": "Feeding and Caring for Farm Animals 49 Activity 7: Feed formulation – Making silage and cost calculation Silage is the preserved feed for ruminant animals, like cows, goat, and sheep. It is prepared from green fodder to maintain it without losing its nutritional value. The word silage is derived from ‘silo’ meaning a pit or container with stored food. You will learn to make silage from green fodder, with controlled fermentation in an anaerobic (without oxygen) environment. Science of Silage Making For example, we make a pickle from mango or any other fruit or vegetable; silage is a pickle of green fodder for ruminants. You are using a naturally controlled fermentation process for silage making. It is like making pickles of cucumber or curd from milk. In this process, sugar content in green fodder gets converted into lactic acid by the action of ‘fermentative lactic acid bacteria’. These bacteria grow in anaerobic conditions. Due to bacterial growth, the temperature of the silage increases during the initial 2 to 8 days and acidity increases due to lactic acid (pH decreases up to 4.0 to 3.8) in 15 to 20 days. Step 1: Chop it using a fodder chopping machine to 2–3cm. You can collect chopped fodder from a farmer/animal owner or do this activity directly in the fields. Collect approximately 30–50kg of green fodder (any green fodder, like maize, sugarcane leaves, Napier grass can be used for silage). Chopping of fodder is essential so that we can compact it in a silage bag. If silage bags are unavailable, use any polyethene or High- Density Polyethene (HDPE) bag or container. You can make silage from green fodder by following the steps in Figure 2.11:"}
{"id": "class 8__vocational education__p72__c1", "text": "Kaushal Bodh — Grade 8 50 Step 2: Fill the chopped fodder into the silage bag while pressing it firmly with your foot. Compacting or pressing chopped fodder in the bag removes air (oxygen). Step 3: Tie the upper end of the bag firmly with a thread. You can also seal it using adhesive tape to minimise air entry. The silage-making process gets completed in 2–3 weeks. During this process, do not open the bag. After 2–3 weeks, when you open the bag, the silage should have: • No fungal or mould growth • Golden brown colour • Pleasant fruity aroma • Free-flowing and non-sticky texture • Mildly acidic taste with an optimum pH of around 4.0–4.5 (add 25 g of silage to 100 mL of water; check pH after 15 minutes). Figure 2.11: Making silage from green fodder Once the silage is ready, you can use it to feed a goat, sheep (1 to 1.5kg per day), and a cow, buffalo (10 to 15kg per day) after taking the approval of the farmer/animal owner. Do not feed the animal without permission. If you observe mould of white or black colour, or observe a bad smell, throw away this silage and do not feed it to the animal. It will lead to food poisoning, serious illness and even death of the animal."}

Dry fodder provides the necessary Dry Matter for fulfilling appetite, helps in the better functioning of the digestive system and provides critical minerals to animals. The digestibility of dry fodder can be increased by adding a mineral mixture (which can be collected from a local veterinary clinic) and jaggery. This is a simple yet effective treatment for improving the palatability and digestibility of dry fodder, especially during harsh summer or dry season. You can do this activity directly in a farmer’s field or ask farmers/animal owners to help you do the activity in school. You can help them get dry fodder at school. You can treat dry fodder by following the steps shown in Figure 2.12. Step 1: Collect chopped dry fodder (5 to 10kg). It can be rice, wheat, jawar, hilly grass straw, or any legume crop stubble that farmers usually burn in the fields after crop harvest. Step 2: Add 3% jaggery (300g for 10 kg fodder) and common salt 1% (100g for 10kg fodder) in 5L of water. If jaggery is unavailable, you can use the waste flour of wheat, rice, jawar, etc. You can also add 100g of mineral mixture (optional).

Farmers/ animal owners use local herbs, like neem, lantana leaves and turmeric to prevent parasites. Did you know? Different geographical regions in India have unique shepherd communities.

Raika/Rabari in Rajasthan, Fakirani Jats in Haryana and Maldharis in Gujarat mainly herd camels and sheep. Dhangar in Maharashtra and Kurubas in Karnataka are known for sheep rearing. By tradition, these nomadic communities rear different livestock and often travel with them for food and shelter. If a local herder community is in your locality, ask them about their lifestyle and love for their animals. Also, ask them about challenges they face, including those related to the health of their animals, and how they overcome them. Another common health problem in cows and goats is indigestion.

From the wooden doors of our homes to fruit and vegetable carts, from school benches to cricket bats, wood baskets, fences, jewellery and toys—they are everywhere (Figure 3.1). They are also seen in the handles of our kitchen tools, bookshelves and even fishermen’s boats and oars. India is known for its ancient buildings and architectures. These buildings have stood the test of time. Most were built of wood, stone and other naturally occurring materials. From the Hidimba Temple in Manali, Rumtek Monastery in Sikkim and Vishrambaagh Wada in Pune—these buildings are renowned for their architecture and intricate decorative woodwork. Another example Figure 3.2: Padmanabhapuram Palace is the Padmanabhapuram Palace in Tamil Nadu, one of Asia’s largest wooden palaces (Figure 3.2). It was built four hundred years ago and is spread over 6.5 acres. Wood is used as fuel in some parts of the country. It is also used as construction material for making houses, tools, weapons, furniture, packaging, artworks, and paper. Craftsmen and carpenters have shaped wood into beautiful and functional objects for generations. Think of the carved wooden pillars in old temples, the sturdy bullock carts that travel through villages, or even the simple wooden ladle used to stir daal and curries. Humans have used this material in many imaginative ways for their benefits. Even when many different materials are available, wood is still used in many ways. Wood and bamboo are increasingly preferred over concrete and bricks for building houses and schools as they keep rooms cooler in summer and warmer in winter (Figure 3.3). Sports like cricket, badminton and hockey rely on strong wooden materials. In some places, even bridges and equipment in playgrounds are made from these materials because they are strong and last long."}
{"id": "class 8__vocational education__p85__c1", "text": "Working with Wood and Bamboo 63 Since trees can be planted to replace the ones that have been cut, wood is considered a renewable resource. However, its use is not sustainable if its consumption exceeds the number of new trees planted. It must be noted that there are certain areas, such as those at high altitudes in the Himalayas, where trees do not grow easily. Once cut, entire forests disappear. Therefore, wood must be used judiciously. Ideally, the wood of a tree should be used after it has completed its lifecycle on earth—this is a sustainable approach compared to cutting off younger trees for wood. This approach is in alignment with our culture and traditions. While using natural resources, our ancestors used to pray to the earth. For example, the Atharva Veda says, “Whatever we dig out from you, O Earth! May that have quick regeneration. May we not damage our vital habitat and earth.” Substitutes like engineered wood or bamboo can be used instead of wood. Examples of engineered wood around you include plywood and Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF). Engineered wood is usually made using recycled wood, sawdust (fine particles or dust produced when wood goes through different processes in the production of objects), tiny wood particles, and wooden fibre. Bamboo, on the contrary, is a perennial grass and grows back when cut (Figure 3.4). There are several species of bamboo in India, and these are grown in many parts of the country, with the maximum amount being grown in the north-eastern part of India.

How do I keep myself and others safe? • Handling tools: Use all the cutting tools carefully. Learn the proper techniques to hold and use tools. Use masks and safety goggles to protect your eyes from wood dust. • Workplace safety: Keep the workspace organised and free from any unnecessary dust and wood cuttings. Keep tools in their proper place after use. Internet safety: Ask your teacher for help while using the Internet. Be careful not to upload or download anything without checking. Do not share your personal information with anyone. What do I need to know before I start? Natural wood is available in hard and softwood, depending on the kind of tree. Wood from different trees is used for different purposes. For example, hardwood from babool and mango trees is used for construction (making houses, bridges, window frames, flooring, etc.), while the jackfruit tree is used for making furniture and small objects, like pooja stands, handicrafts, etc. Softwood from pine and deodar is used for making lightweight furniture, shelves and packing boxes, while eucalyptus (Nilgiri) is used for making paper. Wood from the teak (Sagawan) tree is used for building ships and outdoor furniture."}
{"id": "class 8__vocational education__p88__c1", "text": "Kaushal Bodh — Grade 8 66 As you may have guessed from its name, hardwood can be challenging to work with, requiring stronger tools and specific techniques. Softwood is easier to cut, shape and finish, making it more suitable for you to work with. Bamboo is also easy to work with. You can even use plywood or recycled wood from old wooden furniture or objects. Look at the wooden objects around you and check if they are made of soft or hardwood using the fingernail test. The test is simple–press your thumbnail against a wooden surface and pull it along. If it leaves a scratch mark, it’s softwood; if not, it’s hardwood. Activity 1: Visit a Local Woodworking/Bamboo Workshop Have you ever wondered how raw wood or bamboo becomes useful, like a chair or a table? What is the first step in turning a simple piece of wood or bamboo into a finished product? By visiting a carpenter’s workshop, you will discover how carpenters take decisions at each stage—from choosing the right materials to designing, shaping, cutting, and assembling the final product. Think about what you want to ask the carpenter(s) about their process of creating products and the things they take care of at every stage.

Activity 2: Understanding Bamboo or Wooden Products Look at the objects made up of wood/bamboo around you and pick any one of them. You will find that different parts of a wooden object are joined in various ways. Any wooden object is generally made of different parts ‘assembled’ (or joined) together. Thus, joints are essential in making any wooden or bamboo product. Figure 3.6 shows common joints used in wooden products. Of course, there are other ways of joining parts of an object, for example, with nails, screws, wood glue or with bamboo string (also known as twine)."}

They are used to join parts—nails are fixed using a hammer, and screws are fixed using screwdrivers. You need to make a small dent in the wood to place the screw tip. Using a screwdriver will help. Different types and sizes of nails and screws are used in woodwork. Besides nails and screws, nuts and bolts are also used—these are fastened through a hole drilled with a hand or power drill. Joining moving parts In some objects, the parts move, like windows, doors, cupboards, chests, and similar objects. Hinges join these moving parts. Hinges are used for smooth movement and allowing parts like doors or lids to open and close easily. This provides durability to wooden objects, so that they last a long time.

{"id": "class 8__vocational education__p106__c1", "text": "Kaushal Bodh — Grade 8 84 Automation means using technology to control everyday devices automatically. Instead of switching things on and off by hand, automation uses sensors, controllers and simple computer programmes to run these tasks independently (Figure 4.1). Imagine a classroom where all students and teachers leave immediately after the final bell. The lights and fans often remain on because no one remembers to switch them off. This wastes electricity and increases electricity bills. Automation can help in such situations. If the classroom has an automated power system with a motion sensor, the lights will automatically turn off when no motion is detected. This simple change can save energy and reduce costs. Another example of automation is an automatic garden irrigation system, where a moisture sensor is installed in the soil. When the soil becomes too dry, the sensor sends a signal to a water pump. The pump then automatically turns on and waters your plants. Once the soil has enough moisture, the system turns the pump off. This saves you from having to check the garden every day and helps conserve water by watering plants only when needed. Automation is not a new idea—it has always been a part of our world. Nature had already perfected automation before humans started creating machines to automate tasks. Look at the human body. Without thinking about it, your heart beats automatically to pump blood, your lungs breathe in oxygen and release carbon dioxide, and your stomach digests food after eating. All these functions happen without conscious effort, just like an automated machine. The body uses signals, such as nerve impulses and hormones, to decide when and how to act, just as an intelligent system uses sensors and controllers. If we look around, nature itself is in automation mode. Like modern automation, nature follows systems that work independently, using signals and patterns. y Sunrise and Sunset: The sun rises and sets daily without any action on our part. y Water Cycle: Water evaporates from lakes and oceans, forms clouds, and falls back as rain, following a natural cycle."}

If you have done that, then you were not driving a real car but a simulation. Do you know how pilots learn to fly a plane? Besides learning about aeroplanes and their functioning and flying with an instructor, they also use ‘simulators’. Simulators allow pilots to experience flying without actually being in a plane. Similarly, there are simulation platforms where you can try different electronic circuits without physically building them. You can draw circuits on a computer screen and test them to check if they work successfully. Simulation platforms help you prepare for building physical systems. In such case, you will not be making mistakes when you make ‘real-life’ circuits. In this activity, you will work on circuit simulation software to build and try out simple circuits. Tinkercad is a simulation platform. You can explore other platforms using the following search words:  Simulation for building circuits for beginners  Platform for making circuits You can search for tutorials for simulations.

You want your circuit to switch the circuit ‘ON’ when it is dark or switch the electric pump ‘OFF’ when the tank is full. When it becomes dark at night, our eyes sense the darkness, or when water starts overflowing from a tank, our ears hear that sound. Our sensing organs are the eyes, ears, tongue, nose, and skin. They inform our brains about things happening around us. Now, to inform an electronic circuit that it needs to become automatic, it needs to sense things. This is done by components called ‘sensors’. How automation works? When we touch something hot, our skin senses the temperature (input). It sends a signal to our brain (process). Our brain signals our hand to move away from the hot object. A representation of how one brain senses an input and processes it into output in given in Figure 4.8. Skin senses temperature and informs brain. (Input) Brain processes the information and instructs hands to retract. (Processing) Hand moves away from the hot object. (Output) Figure 4.8: Representation of how our brain senses an input and processes it into output Similarly, automation follows a simple cycle that allows machines or systems to perform tasks without constant human control. This cycle consists of three key steps: 1. Input (Sensing) y Sensors detect changes in the surrounding, such as motion, temperature or light. Example: A motion sensor detects movement in a room. 2. Processing (Decision making) y A microcontroller or processor analyses the input and decides what action to take. Example: If movement is detected, the processor turns the lights on."}

This cycle continues as long as the system is active, making automation an efficient way to reduce manual work and improve efficiency in daily life. The microcontroller is the brain of the circuit (Figure 4.8). It processes the sensor information and asks the output devices to act. You need to give instructions to get the desired response from the microcontrollers (Figure 4.9). This set of instructions given to the microcontroller is called a ‘programme’. These microcontrollers are like small computers. Depending on their processing power and functions, different types of microcontrollers are available in the market. You need to choose the microcontroller depending on your application.

They make these predictions based on past data, assuming that similar trends will continue. Data is any information collected for a specific purpose in the form of facts, figures, photographs, videos, and so on (Figures 5.1 and 5.2). After collection, the data is organised so that we can interpret it and draw conclusions. For example, suppose we have data about temperature, humidity, and rainfall over a period of time. In that case, we can predict the chances of rain, given specific conditions of temperature and humidity. Imagine a village where farmers usually grow crops that need water. However, if past data on temperature and humidity show that a particular summer will be hotter and the rains will arrive late, the weather forecast can help them plan better. Instead of planting the usual crops, they can either delay sowing or choose crops that need less water. This way, they can avoid losses and better use their resources. In today’s age of information technology, data is considered an essential asset since it provides crucial information to make informed decisions. Data helps us in everyday life, for example, by estimating travel time or finding an allergy to some food in our diet.

You will conduct a water audit by systematically examining its uses and identifying sources of wastage. The data collected on water usage will be used to estimate water usage in different scenarios. To get accurate results, the data collected has to be correct and authentic (e.g., if you are collecting data on red cars passing a traffic signal in one hour, then a car of any other colour will not be included), reliable (e.g., even if two people are collecting data on red cars, they must come up with the same data), and obtained by experiment or from a source that can be trusted (e.g., before data collection, observers decide the colour will be considered red). This process will also prepare you to analyse different kinds of data. Water in India: A big challenge India has only four per cent of the world’s freshwater but nearly eighteen per cent of the world’s population. At the same time, water is not available equally everywhere in the country; some places face floods, while others experience droughts. Droughts are often seen as natural disasters, but in reality, they are primarily caused by human activities, such as deforestation, poor agricultural practices, and over-extraction of groundwater. They are also due to mismanagement and misuse of water at the micro (household) and macro (district/ state) levels. Did you know that leaving a tap running for five minutes can waste 45 litres of water? Are we using our water carefully? Or are some of us using water irresponsibly and wasting others’ share of water? Some people struggle to get water, depending on water tankers or walking long distances to fill a single bucket.

Water is measured in millilitres (mL) for small quantities, but litres (L) are more suitable for household use, and cubic metres (m³) for larger quantities, like municipal supply or water storage (Figure 5.3). One cubic metre of water equals 1,000 litres.

To measure the water flow from the tap, let it flow into a bucket for a minute. Measure the amount of water collected in the bucket. Now, you can measure the amount of water consumed by noting how long a person keeps the tap running (when the tap is ‘ON’) while washing utensils.

Activity 3: Estimating average consumption in a household It may not be possible for you to collect data from each household in the locality. Therefore, you can select a few houses. You can plan to collect data from a minimum of ten families. If you are working in a group of five students, this will collectively become data from 50 families. This will also help you understand water consumption in your home. It will be convenient to record the data in your notebook. After returning to school, prepare a table in a spreadsheet on the computer. You can apply formulae in the spreadsheet. This will help you analyse data and present it in different forms, like graphs and pie charts. If you do not have a computer, you can make tables to enter data in your notebook, and use a calculator. (a) Washing machine consumes approximately 70 L per cycle. You can check online from the website of the manufacturer. (b) RO water filter wastes approximately 3 L of water per every 1 L of treated water. Did you know? Figure 5.7: (a) Washing machine Figure 5.7: (b) RO filter specifications indicate the amount of water used Table 5.1 contains a sample of a form you can use to collect data from the field.

You will also need to calculate water flow from taps, showers, and water pipes in case of water usage for gardening for each home you visit. If a person uses water from an overhead tank, you need to talk to them and estimate water usage based on their lifestyle. For example, taking a bath twice on a daily basis or washing two buckets of clothes daily. Once you have collected the data, you must tabulate it in a spreadsheet or notebook. You can decide the categories for data based on water consumption for activities, like washing clothes, RO water use, car washing, and so on, based on your observations, information gathered and logical reasoning. The accuracy of your analysis will depend on the primary data. Hence, it is necessary to maintain the ‘integrity’ of the data; it should be as accurate, reliable and consistent as possible.

Calculating water availability based on a district’s geography and rainfall may not give you an accurate picture. All rainwater flows into rivers. The entire population, from the origin of the river up to the point where the river meets the sea, depends on river water. Some of these areas have high rainfall, and some have less rainfall. However, the water in the river basin belongs to the entire population. Activity 5: Compare and analyse the data The data speaks for itself. What did your data say?

The person who is listening to you, or reading a report you have written, must know where the data is from so that they can refer to it. They would also like to be assured that the data is reliable. Since data keeps on changing (e.g., population numbers change, climatic parameters change), you must mention the year the data was reported. In which case, for example, you will say/write as follow: The Government of India, through Jal Jeevan Mission, is trying to provide 55 L of tap water per day for rural populations.

Activity 6: Identify wastage points and amount of wastewater This activity involves inspecting areas where water is wasted, such as leaking taps or overflowing tanks. You can focus on areas that need immediate attention by identifying wastage points. Often, leakages need a little attention to fix them. Inspect common areas where water gets wasted, such as taps in your school or home, pipelines, or overhead tanks. Look for signs, like dripping taps (Figure 5.8), wet patches under pipes, or overflowing tanks. Record your findings in a notebook. Note down the location and type of problem. You can record the wastage of water by using a bucket and a stopwatch. 1. Start the stopwatch when water starts to waste. 2. Stop it when the wastage ends. 3. Note the time duration. 4. Repeat the process. You can calculate the volume also. Now, share your observations. You can take simple steps to reduce wastage (Figure 5.9). Figure 5.8: Recording wastage of water due to a dripping tap"}
{"id": "class 8__vocational education__p149__c1", "text": "Water Audit for Water Management 127 1. Fixing a leaking tap: Start with easy solutions, like tightening the tap and changing the washer. You can invite a local plumber to learn about the tap mechanism and tools like plumber tape and wrench. You will have to turn the water mains off before you start work. Using a spanner, take off the tap’s cover to remove the handle. You will probably find this under the hot or cold sign. Undo the screw and remove the handle. If the tap has a metal cover, unscrew it by hand, or use a wrench or tap spanner. Unscrew the tap bonnet, and completely remove the headgear. You should see a large body washer, o-ring and jumper valve. The jumper valve should fall out. Replace the body washer, the o-ring and the jumper valve with new parts. Apply a tap lubricant to the spindle and valve for better sealing and smoother tap operation. Refit the bonnet and spindle. Be careful not to over-tighten the nuts. Put the tap back together, turn it off, and turn the water back on. Now, check the tap to make sure it is no longer leaking. Now, you can step back and admire the proper job done, knowing you are not wasting a drop. Figure 5.9: Steps to fix a leaking tap"}

You can restrict the water flow per minute by using aerators or flow caps available in the market. You can also simply open the tap partially when using water (Figure 5.10). Full Tap Throttle With Flow cap With Aerator Figure 5.10: Comparison of water flow with and without flow cap and aerator Groundwater recharge You have learnt about groundwater in Science. As you know, well water and borewell water are essential water sources. One advantage of storing water underground is that evaporation losses are minimal. Unfortunately, due to uncontrolled groundwater extraction, water levels are depleting alarmingly. While many efforts are being made through various water conservation programmes, there are efforts that communities can make to help rainwater percolate into the ground. You can participate as volunteers in programmes around you. The basic principles of water conservation and an example of how they can be applied are: 1. To hold the water in the field: This can be done by making contour bunds on the ground (Figure 5.11). Contours are lines connecting points at equal elevation. Bunds, made up of earth to prevent water from running off the slope, on contour lines hold the water at the same level. This also helps in reducing soil erosion."}

It is possible to reuse the water by removing impurities. When water flows through the river, weeds like hyacinth absorb minerals that are mixed into water; oxygen mixed in water decomposes organic matter; and sunlight kills harmful bacteria. Through these natural processes, river water becomes clean when it flows. Wastewater from domestic use, like wastewater from sinks, baths, washing machines, and kitchens, is called greywater. Instead of letting this water go to waste, it can be reused for some purposes, such as irrigation, cleaning, or even groundwater recharge. As a part of our efforts to reuse water, you can try any of the following greywater recycling systems: 1. Wastewater from washing vegetables or cooking is used to water plants: Runoff water from a hand pump or a washing sink (to ensure the water is not too soapy) can be used to water the kitchen garden (Figure 5.14).

Installing a reed bed grey water system at your school, or visiting a grey water recycling system: You can make a reed bed system for wastewater from your school (Figure 5.15 and 5.16). This follows a natural filtration mechanism. Grey water is collected in a tank to settle the suspended particles. This is called the sedimentation tank. Water from the sedimentation tank passes through the roots of plants, like Canna indica, Colocasia, and many other local water loving-plants, which absorb the organic pollutants and heavy metals (Figure 5.16).

You know that a critical part of the chain is ensuring that sellers can reach buyers. Advertising plays a very important role in completing this part of the chain. However, the role of advertising is not limited to simply selling a product or service; it is also a means of communicating important social messages. Remember how you heard about a film that you wanted to see, a place you wanted to visit, something you wanted to eat or buy, just anything you wanted to do. Also, think about how you heard about campaigns, like the Swachh Bharat Mission or the polio vaccination drive. There are various ways of hearing about things from friends, family, books, magazines, newspapers, and social media–the list is long. Among this list are ‘advertisements’. Advertisements are meant to persuade you to do something. For example, a board outside a small shop describing its products is intended to tempt you to enter; sometimes, this job is done by persons outside the shop loudly describing their products. Another example is posters or clips on television or radio that urge citizens to keep their surroundings clean, to vaccinate themselves and their children, or to avail different services provided by the government, such as small savings schemes. Thus, advertising can be of two broad varieties–commercial and social, depending on the message conveyed. Did you know? The first few newspaper advertisements in India appeared in 1780 in the Bengal Gazette. In 1780, the first English language newspaper in India was published from Kolkata, known as Bengal Gazette. It was founded and edited by James Augustus Hicky. The Bengal Gazette was popularly referred to as Hicky’s Bengal Gazette. Figure 6.2 shows an advertisement for the well- known local hair oil ‘Jabakusum,’ which was published in the newspaper. Figure 6.2: An advertisement from late 18th century"}
{"id": "class 8__vocational education__p159__c1", "text": "137 Creating Advertisements Historically, India had a system of informers who used to announce important messages by beating drums or dhindora, a practice popularly known as ‘Dhindhora Pitna’ in Hindi (Figure 6.3). Also called town criers, they would act as advertisers, announcing important messages in villages and informing people of the arrival of merchants and the goods they were carrying. This practice is similar to that of a person announcing events or promoting products/services using with a loudspeaker, moving around the city on a bike, auto rickshaw or jeep. Some of these practices continue to date, for example, door-to-door vendors use bells or shout out phrases to inform people of their arrival and the goods they offer. You may have also seen hand-painted signboards and murals conveying promotional messages in marketplaces (Figure 6.4). Street performances like ‘nukkad natak’ (street plays) and folk songs also increase awareness about products and services, and communicate social messages. However, even today, many people rely on word-of-mouth advertising, especially owners of small businesses that run out of homes or workshops, small retail shops and street vendors. For example, people from a town you visit will tell you—‘Buy sweets from this shop, mangoes from that, and traditional crafts from there’. Community gatherings and events during festivals (e.g., melas or fairs organised for the sale of different products) are also used to advertise products and services so that word-of-mouth advertising spreads. However, word-of-mouth advertising does not always work and is usually limited to a specific locality. Suppose someone can offer products and/or services distant from their immediate locality. In that case, they should be able to reach more people and get the opportunity to state exactly what is unique about their product and why people should prefer it over other products.

Always inform a parent, guardian, or teacher before visiting a small business, and choose public and well-lit areas for interviews and interactions. 2. Respect the privacy and consent of small business owners when taking pictures or recording videos. 3. Be mindful of cultural sensitivities, and show respect towards the small business owners and their work. 4. Ethical advertising – It includes truthfulness, fairness and should be socially responsible. You should take care of the following: (a) Copyright: Ensure that you use original content, or if using someone else’s work (images, music, text), obtain permissions. Do not simply copy content from the Internet without mentioning the source. The process of copying content as such is called plagiarism. (b) Fake Advertising: Never make false claims about a product or service. Your advertisement should reflect the real features and benefits of the product. (c) Cultural and Gender Sensitivity: Avoid stereotypes or offensive content. Internet Safety: Ask your teachers for help while using the Internet. Be careful not to upload or download anything without permission; and do not share personal information anywhere. What do I need to know before I start?

Sometimes we are even persuaded to do something against our will (e.g., taking a COVID-19 vaccine even though most of us are afraid of needles)? And why do some advertisements become so much a part of our everyday life that we even start associating some things with them (e.g., we think of a product as soon as we hear a jingle)? Advertisements are deliberately designed to be attractive and pleasing, thus enabling people to build associations. There is also an attempt to ensure people associate the product or service with a specific visual or phrase. This activity will help you explore the essential elements that make-up advertisements."}
{"id": "class 8__vocational education__p165__c1", "text": "143 Creating Advertisements Logos and Taglines/slogans A logo is a visual element, often a symbol or a combination of words and images, used to represent a brand or product. A tagline is a short memorable phrase that represents a brand or product. Most often, logos and taglines/slogans are used across different advertisements of the same organisation or campaign to help people associate the products/services with them.

Audio and Audio-Video advertisements: Music and jingles, and duration Audio (e.g., on radio) or audio-video (e.g., on television, social media) advertisements are usually accompanied by striking music. Sometimes, jingles (short, catchy rhymes) are used to describe the brand in a catchy manner. Just as a single poster can be used to advertise a product/ service, the time used in audio-video advertising is short. This is because the person listening/seeing the advertisement does not get bored. You may even get irritated if the advertisement interrupts you while watching a film or a match."}

Once you have prepared this list, you need to decide amongst yourselves which group will approach which businesses. Follow the steps below to initiate the work towards developing an advertisement.

You may have shared something with other students and teachers during classroom presentations or school assemblies. You can also invite your family members and others to see your work. You can do this through Kaushal Mela. But first, you must plan each detail carefully. Planning is essential since it helps you decide how to reach your goal. You must think about what needs to be done and when it needs to be done so that everything goes smoothly. For example, if you are planning a presentation on water usage in the community, you need to decide when and where, keeping in mind that the maximum number of people should watch it. Planning also helps prevent wastage of time and resources. For example, if you want to demonstrate the process of home automation, you must ensure that all the materials are available in one place in the correct quantity. Completing every activity at the given time is crucial for success. Different activities need different times for completion. Some materials need more time to procure, and some processes need more time than others. Further, some of the activities depend on others for completion. Therefore, plan in such a way that you will be able to achieve your goal. Since Kaushal Mela will involve a lot of planning and coordination, you must plan each detail carefully. Responsibilities must be assigned for each activity, and the process for each activity must be discussed in detail. You must also develop a plan to work together as a team. Table 7.1 below will help you plan for Kaushal Mela. Do add more details based on your discussions.

Therefore, students should reflect on what they have learnt from others. It can help improve their soft skills, deepen their understanding, and enhance the project’s overall success. Engaging with others enables students to communicate effectively, share ideas, and collaborate on tasks. Diverse perspectives and ideas are introduced, which help students learn from the viewpoints of others. This can help them approach problems in a new way and enhance their creativity and problem-solving skills. Listening to others, such as experts and professionals, provides valuable insights that can help improve learner’s practices. Students must identify what they learnt during field trips, online and offline interactions with experts, family and friends, community members, and other sources. They must be able to respond to the following questions: 1. What did you learn from field trips, interactions, video lectures, or experts? 2. What did you learn from your friends? Did you help them with something? 3. What did you learn from family members, siblings, and community elders? 4. What did you learn from people in the community?

Time Allocation: The time allocated for each activity is a suggestion, and teachers can adjust it based on class size and the complexity of the project. Cross-curricular Connections: The projects can be drawn from other subjects in the Middle Stage—Language, Mathematics, Science, Social Science, Art Education and Physical Education and Well-being. This allows for a more holistic learning experience. Connection to other curricular areas is also indicated in the ensuing tables. Student Reflection: Reflection prompts are included (‘What did I learn?’, and ‘What else can I do?’) to encourage students to think critically about their work. Safety: The tables emphasise safety precautions (LO 6) for activities involving tools or potential hazards. Open-ended Learning: The ‘What else can I do?’ section (LO 18) encourages students to explore connecting to home and extend their learning. Learning Outcomes: Each project focuses on developing specific skills and knowledge (LO 1–11) along with essential values related to work (LO 12–17). Please note that LO 12–17, which refer to the essential values while working across areas, are applicable across all activities."}
