{"id": "class 5__english class 5__p3__c1", "text": "Foreword The Foundational Stage in school education, as envisaged by the National Education Policy 2020, serves as the cornerstone for the holistic development of children. It enables them not only to imbibe the invaluable samskaras rooted in our country’s ethos and constitutional framework, but also to acquire basic literacy and numeracy. This foundation equips them to transition seamlessly into the more challenging Preparatory Stage. The Preparatory Stage acts as a bridge between the Foundational and the Middle Stages, spanning three years from Grade 3 to Grade 5. The education provided during this stage builds upon the pedagogical approaches of the Foundational Stage. While the play-way, discovery, and activity-based learning methods continue, children are also introduced to textbooks and more formal classroom settings. This introduction aims to not overwhelm but establish a foundation across curricular areas, promoting holistic learning and self-exploration through reading, writing, speaking, drawing, singing, and playing. This comprehensive approach encompasses physical education, art education, environmental education, languages, mathematics, basic science, and social science. This comprehensive approach ensures children are well-prepared both at the cognitive-sensitive and physical-pranic (emotional) levels to effortlessly transition to the Middle Stage. Santoor, the textbook for Grade 5, is meticulously designed to align with these objectives. It adheres to the recommendations of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023. The textbook emphasises conceptual understanding, critical thinking, creativity, values and dispositions essential for this developmental stage. It incorporates cross-cutting themes, such as inclusion, multilingualism, gender equality, and cultural rootedness integrating appropriate ICT and school-based assessments. The engaging content and activities are designed to captivate students and encourage peer group learning, thus enriching the educational experience for students as well as teachers."}
{"id": "class 5__english class 5__p4__c1", "text": "iv It is crucial to remember the pedagogical focus of the textbook emphasising understanding, critical thinking, reasoning, and decision making. Children’s innate curiosity at this stage should be nurtured by addressing their questions and designing activities based on core learning principles. Though the play-way method continues, the nature of toys and games used for teaching evolves to enhance engagement rather than mere attraction. While this textbook is valuable, children should also explore additional resources on the subject. School libraries should facilitate this extended learning, and parents and teachers should support their endeavours. An effective learning environment motivates students, keeping them engaged and fostering curiosity and wonder vital for learning. With confidence, I recommend this textbook to all students and teachers at the Preparatory Stage. I extend my gratitude to everyone involved in its development, hopeful that it will meet expectations. As NCERT remains committed to systemic reforms and improving publication quality, we welcome feedback to refine the textbook content.

{"id": "class 5__english class 5__p5__c1", "text": "Language lies at the centre of human cognitive, social, and cultural experiences. It enables effective communication, which is integral to the formation and functioning of societies and cultures (NCF-SE, p. 234). The present textbook is designed in alignment with the visionary framework of the NEP 2020 and the NCF-SE 2023. In the preparatory stage, students develop proficiency in speaking and competencies in reading and writing in both languages — Reading in Language 1 (R1) and Reading in Language 2 (R2). While students achieve these faster in R1, they are expected to gain familiarity with R2, gradually progressing from basic communication skills to greater fluency and proficiency in speaking and writing. To take children well beyond foundational literacy and develop a genuine interest in independent reading, the textbook draws from children’s real-life experiences and reflects their cultural and social milieu. It is purposefully crafted to meet specific stage competencies and grade-based learning outcomes, ensuring alignment with core principles of the subject. It uses language appropriate for the grade level and provides support for unfamiliar vocabulary and complex sentence structures. It incorporates digital elements and external references suitably within the material. Local context heavily influences content selection. The textbook aims to be engaging, striking a balance between visuals and text, leaning towards visually appealing material making it suitable for easy comprehension by young learners. To foster oral skills, this textbook offers engaging learning materials that encourage students to converse with each other. The content features a range of activities, such as reciting rhymes, singing songs, role-playing, etc., facilitating in-class practice. To enhance reading abilities, the textbook presents a diverse array of content, encompassing stories, poems, narratives and a comic strip. It maintains a balance between familiar and unfamiliar texts and contexts. With large font sizes, colourful illustrations, and captivating chapter titles, it captivates student interest. The text stimulates critical thinking and sparks imagination, fostering curiosity. The content is structured to aid students in transitioning from guided to independent reading. For honing writing skills, the selected content systematically imparts writing proficiency. Students About the Book"}
{"id": "class 5__english class 5__p6__c1", "text": "vi engage in activities that encourage independent practice, such as constructing simple sentences, encouraging creative expression and skill development in writing. All these are done through various sections, like ‘Let us Recite’, ‘Let us Think’, ‘Let us Speak’, ‘Let us Learn’, ‘Let us Listen’, and ‘Let us Write’, ‘Let us Do’, and ‘Let us Explore’. This not only helps the learner in the process of language acquisition but also builds up their confidence level. Curricular Goals (CGs) lay the foundation of every learning-teaching material. In line with the textbooks for Grades 1 and 2, Santoor (Grade 3) has been developed after careful consideration of the curricular goals. The curricular goals for language address the diverse needs of learners in a language classroom. Communication and comprehension are at the heart of every language and the same has been reiterated through CG1: Sustains effective communication skills for day-to-day interactions, enhancing their oral ability to express ideas. The book provides ample opportunities for learners to engage with the text and share their input. Sections titled ‘Let us Speak’ and ‘Think and Discuss’ subsection of ‘Let us Think’ present opportunities for students to be creative with replies and share with classmates allowing them to engage with language in a meaningful way. Similarly, CG 4: Develops a wide range of vocabulary in various contexts and through different sources has been addressed by incorporation of texts and activities that are not limited only to literature but also encompass content areas like mathematics and ‘The World Around Us’ activities and vocabulary pertaining to the same find a place in different units. For example, Unit 1 has activities related to shapes whereas, Unit 4 provides scope for students and teachers to discuss ordinal numbers. In Grades 3 and 4, although guided writing is the main component, there is a gradual progress towards making learners independent writers. This is in alignment with the CG 3 that develops the ability to express their understanding, experiences, feelings, and ideas in writing. Reading as a process is not limited to decoding, says CG 2 which aims to develop fluency in reading and the ability to read with comprehension. The activities in Santoor are designed to evoke responses by the students’ reflecting their understanding of the text through the ‘Answer the following’ subsection."}
{"id": "class 5__english class 5__p7__c1", "text": "vii One of the major recommendations of NCF-SE 2023 is the inclusion of knowledge of India. Indian values and traditions have been presented to the learner in an easily comprehensible way. The theme of Unit 1 is ‘Let’s Have Fun’. This unit introduces the child with the magic of humour. Humour can transform the classroom into a space where creativity, confidence, and critical thinking thrive. The unit comprises a humorous and heartwarming poem ‘Papa’s Spectacles’ and a story ‘Gone with the Scooter’. In the poem the father is looking for his spectacles everywhere in the house and when it is found at an obvious place, resulting in laughter. Similarly, in the story, a boy and his friends are playing with a hockey ball when suddenly things take an unexpected turn. The theme for Unit 2 is ‘My Colourful World’, and it comprises of a poem ‘ The Rainbow’ and a story ‘ The Wise Parrot’. Both the chapters are inspiring, and encourage learners to respect nature and freedom. Through a short poem titled ‘ The Rainbow’, students are introduced to the concept of things created by humans and things created by mother nature. The story ‘ The Wise Parrot’ helps the learners understand the value of freedom and to use it responsibly. Unit 3, titled ‘Water’, attempts to expose children to the world of water— underwater life and aquatic organisms, and the importance of saving water. The unit begins with an engaging poem, ‘The Frog’ that talks about a playful frog, and aims to develop an appreciation of nature. The unit also includes a chapter, ‘What a Tank’, that describes different traditional and artistic water tanks found in rural areas of Punjab. The chapter emphasises the judicious use of water. The theme for Unit 4 is ‘Ups and Downs’. It includes successes and failures, joys and sorrows, and life‘s ups and downs. Under this theme, a poem ‘Gilli Danda’ and a story ‘ The Decision of the Panchayat’ have been incorporated in the book. The poem showcases the joys of childhood, and inspires teamwork. Through the story ‘ The Decision of the Panchayat’ the students are introduced to the importance of presence of mind, problem-solving, and truthfulness. Both the chapters intend to prepare the learners to adapt to the changing environment, navigate complex situations, and achieve their goals effectively. Unit 5, ‘Work is Worship’, introduces children to the world of work. The unit contains a poem ‘Vocation’ allowing the readers to look into the world from the lens of a child. The chapter ‘Glass"}
{"id": "class 5__english class 5__p8__c1", "text": "viii Bangles’ emphasises the importance of crafts and skills. The chapter depicts a wonderful bond and teamwork between a father and his daughter. The unit endorses the idea that no work is superior or inferior. Throughout the textbook, language and literacy, physical, socio-emotional, aesthetic, and cognitive domains have been integrated along with the development of positive habits to create a learning impression in totality for children. Development of Annamaya, Pranamaya, Manomaya, and Vijnanmaya kosha is an ongoing process which leads to the manifestation of Anandmaya kosha. The present textbook is a step in this direction. In addition to the material provided in the textbook, teachers may also use the matter embedded in the QR code. Further, as suggested in ‘Note to the Teacher’ section given throughout the book, teachers are encouraged to use local stories, proverbs and objects in the classroom, as well as audio and video support from DIKSHA platform. The textbook is only one tool, learning needs many resources. Children also absorb a wealth of knowledge by observing their surroundings, interacting with peers and elders like grandparents, engaging in hands-on activities, watching TV, using mobile devices, playing with toys and games, listening to stories and poems, working on projects, visiting culturally significant places, and travelling. It is crucial to appreciate and align this diverse learning with the competencies and curricular goals set for this stage. Educating our children is a shared responsibility that extends beyond formal textbooks. Varada Mohan Nikalje Professor and Member-Coordinator Department of Elementary Education, NCERT, New Delhi"}

Immediately, Gopi put his book aside, got up, and ran into the garden. He searched in between the thick grass near the garden fence. But, he found nothing. He looked among the bushes. Nothing was there again. Then, his eyes fell on a heap of dry leaves. There was a white ball on the heap. Gopi reached out and took the ball in his hands. It was a hockey ball."}

I will ask around.” In the evening, Gopi went to the nearby playground where all his friends regularly gathered to play hockey. “Friends, this afternoon I found a ball.

If you are playing as the ‘Goat’, your objective would be to surround all three tigers such that the tigers cannot make a move. • Both the pebbles can be placed on the intersecting points. The goat player places a pebble first on any intersection Next, the tiger places a tiger stone on any intersection, as indicated. • The tiger may jump over the goat to the next intersection. If so, the goat is considered ‘captured’ and will be out of the board. • In order to prevent the tiger from jumping over the goat, the next intersection has to be covered. So the goat player places another pebble at that intersection. • The goat player places one goat on the board at a time. The tiger player can either place the tiger stone or move. • But, the goats cannot move until all thirteen of them are on the board. The tigers must attempt to ‘capture’ the goats by jumping over them into a free space, the goat is then taken off the board."}

Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa A long time ago, in a small village of West Bengal, there lived a kind and wise man named Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. He loved to talk to people about God and taught that all religions are like rivers—they may take different paths, but they all lead to the same ocean. He lived a simple life, wearing plain clothes and eating very little, but his smile and loving words made everyone feel special. One day, a curious young boy named Naren came to meet him. Ramakrishna saw something special in Naren and became his teacher. He taught Naren about courage, kindness, and how to find peace within. Naren later grew up to become the famous Swami Vivekananda, spreading his teacher’s wisdom to the world. Even today, Ramakrishna’s teachings inspire many people everywhere. 1.

The Neem Tree You must have seen a neem tree near your house, or near the school, or beside the road. Almost everyone can recognise a neem tree. The neem is a magic medicine tree because almost every part of the tree is used for medicine. Sometimes, sick people are given neem juice to drink. People use the twigs of the neem tree as a toothbrush to clean their teeth. Burn some dry neem leaves inside the house and see the mosquitoes disappear! When you store winter clothing or blankets, keep dry neem leaves between them. This helps keep away insects. When you store rice, keep dry neem leaves at the bottom of the rice bin. This keeps pests away. Answer the following questions. 1. Where can you find neem trees? 2. Why do you think ‘neem’ is called a magic tree? 3. What happens when dry neem leaves are burnt? 4. Why do people put neem leaves in clothes and rice containers? 5. How are neem twigs used? 6. Find the meaning of the word ‘disappear’ from the following options: a. Appear b. Vanish c. Grow d. Fly 7.

The bangles came in a variety of colours, from deep reds and blues to soft pastels, and were often decorated with patterns showing traditional Indian designs. During the festival of Diwali, the demand for glass bangles increased. Diwali is the festival of lights, a time of celebration and joy, and glass bangles were popular among women at this time.

{"id": "class 5__maths class 5__p3__c1", "text": "The Foundational Stage in school education, as envisaged by the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, serves as the cornerstone for the holistic development of children. It enables them not only to imbibe the invaluable samskaras rooted in our country’s ethos and constitutional framework, but also to acquire basic literacy and numeracy. This foundation equips them to transition seamlessly into the more challenging Preparatory Stage. The Preparatory Stage acts as a bridge between the Foundational and the Middle Stages, spanning three years from Grade 3 to Grade 5. The education provided during this stage builds upon the pedagogical approaches of the Foundational Stage. While the play-way, discovery, and activity-based learning methods continue, children are also introduced to textbooks and more formal classroom settings. This introduction aims not to overwhelm but to establish a foundation across curricular areas, promoting holistic learning and self-exploration through reading, writing, speaking, drawing, singing, and playing. This comprehensive approach encompasses physical education, art education, environmental education, languages, mathematics, basic science, and social science. This comprehensive approach ensures children are well-prepared both at the cognitive, sensitive, physical, and pranic (emotional) levels to effortlessly transition to the Middle Stage. The textbook, Maths Mela for Grade 5 Mathematics is meticulously designed to align with these objectives. It adheres to the recommendations of the National Education Policy 2020 and the National Curriculum Framework for School Education 2023. The textbook emphasises conceptual understanding, critical thinking, creativity, values, and dispositions essential for this developmental stage. It incorporates cross-cutting themes such as inclusion, multilingualism, gender equality, and cultural rootedness integrating appropriate ICT and school-based assessments. The engaging content and activities are designed to captivate students and encourage peer group learning, thus enriching the educational experience for students as well as teachers. Foreword Foreword"}
{"id": "class 5__maths class 5__p4__c1", "text": "iv It is crucial to remember the pedagogical focus of the textbook emphasising understanding, critical thinking, reasoning, and decision making. Children’s innate curiosity at this stage should be nurtured by addressing their questions and designing activities based on core learning principles. While the play-way method continues, the nature of toys and games used for teaching evolves to enhance engagement rather than mere attraction. While this textbook is valuable, children should also explore additional resources on the subject. School libraries should facilitate this extended learning, and parents and teachers should support their endeavours. An effective learning environment motivates students, keeping them engaged and fostering curiosity and wonder vital for learning. With confidence, I recommend this textbook to all students and teachers at the Preparatory Stage. I extend my gratitude to everyone involved in its development, hopeful that it will meet expectations. As NCERT remains committed to systemic reforms and improving publication quality, we welcome feedback to refine the textbook content.

{"id": "class 5__maths class 5__p5__c1", "text": "The textbook Maths Mela for Grade 5, has been developed based on the recent documents — National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023. They aim to ensure that all children achieve basic numerical skills and abilities to think mathematically and logically, solve problems, develop intuitions regarding quantities and reasoning, and feel a sense of joy, wonder, and curiosity. The Preparatory Stage specifically focuses on the development of conceptual ideas about numbers, shapes, and spatial relationships, measurement and data handling, procedural skills and fluency, and computational thinking. In light of this, the book for Grade 5 is designed to support learners in consolidating their learnings in the Foundational Stage and making progress towards dealing with more abstract ideas. The chapters of the book cover the foundational ideas of Mathematics: whole numbers and operations, fractions, shapes and spatial relationships, measurement (length, weight, capacity, time), and data handling. Chapters are woven around certain themes so as to engage children with the ideas and their applications. Ideas will keep recurring throughout the book, building deeper engagement and complexity to suit the interest and curiosity of the growing child. We firmly believe that young learners are capable of reasoning, thinking, and problem-solving in different ways. Therefore, the book provides several occasions for identifying and noticing ideas and relationships across ideas, giving examples and counter-examples to statements, creating objects using mathematical ideas, measuring and quantifying, estimating, and solving problems. There are also opportunities to hone one’s arithmetic skills through bare exercises, games, and puzzles. At some places in the chapters, such opportunities have been provided under the section ‘Let us Play’. Another important purpose behind games and puzzles is to provide learners a stress-free and joyful learning. Most of these need not be assessed. Some tasks are aimed towards ‘computational thinking’ where learners are expected to observe and articulate patterns and find exhaustive solutions and solutions under different constraints. About the Book About the Book"}
{"id": "class 5__maths class 5__p6__c1", "text": "vi We also believe that learners should develop a liking for Mathematics. The chapters of this textbook provide several enjoyable activities, tasks, games, and puzzles that build on children’s intuitions and tap into their experiences in the world around them. These have been given under the section ‘Let Us Do’ at many places in the chapters. These are sometimes used for making an entry to the concept and at other times provide opportunities to consolidate the ideas. The narrative in the chapters is supported through vivid illustrations, which are also integral to the tasks. We hope that this will allow learners to read pictures and use them for developing important mathematical ideas. Mathematical vocabulary and ways of communicating about mathematics have been emphsised throughout the chapters. We continue to provide instructions and explanation with as little use of language as possible. Mathematics is an integrated body of knowledge, with a connected and coherent set of ideas. It can be built logically on commonly shared assumptions. Mathematical thinking and reasoning are an important part of learning mathematics. The book attempts to move away from rote memorisation of rules and procedures which kill learners’ curiosity and burden them. It rather pushes learners to explore and discover important mathematical ideas. The sections named ‘Let Us Think’, ‘Let Us Explore’, and ‘Let Us Discuss’, included at various places, aim at keeping learners curious to reason out their thinking. These will give them reasons and insights that can be used to remember ideas and apply ideas flexibly and creatively, making further learning easier. It is important to engage with these processes of Mathematics so that learners can go beyond routine mathematical problems confidently and without fear and anxiety. We hope that the carefully chosen learning activities will help them make sense of the ideas, develop capacities to solve problems, experience wonder and joy in the process, and be curious about the world of mathematics. In addition to all of these, with growing capacities of children we have introduced a section called “Let Us Solve”. This is aimed to help children hone their skills of using procedures, solving routine problems, and word problems. We believe that the time available for children to work on problems and share their solutions and ideas will be crucial to achieve the objectives of NEP 2020 and NCF-SE 2023. The book carries several suggestions for appropriate activities and experiences (in class and in and around the home) to develop mathematical ideas."}
{"id": "class 5__maths class 5__p7__c1", "text": "vii Teachers’ and parents’ support in changing conditions of learning for our children will be very important to achieve the dreams of a better and more confident nation. The book also advises on the making of simple inexpensive concrete materials for learners to work with, and to develop and communicate their thinking. A few perforated sheets for some of the tasks in the chapters are provided at the end of the book. There are some more ideas in the ‘Note for the Teachers’ for activities and materials. The chapters also show a gradual movement from the use of materials to the use of pictures and making schematic diagrams to make sense of the situation and identify better strategy. The book tries to build models for the ideas using materials and pictures so that learners can use them to develop independent thinking. We would sincerely urge teachers and parents to use the sequence of ideas suggested in the book for teaching and gradually arrive at more formal rules and procedures. When children develop a better understanding, they will be in a better position to appreciate the rules and procedures. Similar care is also to be taken by parents and elder siblings who may help their wards in learning through this book. ‘Note for the Teachers’ may help teachers and parents in appropriately enhancing the child’s learning. Several activities and tasks in the book also require that children talk and discuss their ideas. Learning will significantly improve in a classroom that welcomes and respects learners’ ideas. They will see different ways of thinking and using ideas, and alternative solutions leading to better and independent solutions over a period of time. They will get opportunities to scrutinise each other’s solutions and develop fluency with mathematical language, symbols, and procedures. These will also serve as good assessments of learning for the teacher and also provide feedback to them. The exercises given in the book are also examples of how learners can be assessed. Assessment should be done in multiple forms — using materials and pictures, problem situations and bare problems, activities, creating objects, and sharing and explaining solutions. The book provides enough opportunities for adaptive assessment, assessment for learning, and assessment as learning while the child is engaged in different activities. Teachers can note down their observations while the learners discuss their ideas, replying to the questions asked, and explaining the reasoning for their answer. Such records can be included in the learner’s portfolio."}

About a hundred years ago, there were far fewer vehicles than today. There were animal-drawn carts, cars, and trains.

How can the boatman take the lion, sheep, and grass across the river? Help him so that he can ferry the lion, sheep, and grass across the river safely, and in the minimum number of trips. Find something in the classroom whose count is a— (i) 4-digit number. (ii) 5-digit number. List some quantities whose count is a 4-digit or a 5-digit number in the context of— (i) A tree. (ii) \u0007Your village/town/city, or any other place of your choice. 11"}

{"id": "class 5__phsyical education__p3__c1", "text": "Foreword The Foundational Stage in school education, as envisaged by the National Education Policy 2020, serves as the cornerstone for the holistic development of children. It enables them not only to imbibe the invaluable samskaras rooted in our country’s ethos and constitutional framework, but also to acquire basic literacy and numeracy. This foundation equips them to transition seamlessly into the more challenging Preparatory Stage. The Preparatory Stage acts as a bridge between the Foundational and the Middle stages, spanning three years from Grades 3 – 5. The education provided during this stage builds upon the pedagogical approaches of the Foundational Stage. While the play-way and discovery, plus the activity-based learning methods continue, children are also introduced to textbooks and formal classroom settings. This introduction aims not to overwhelm but to establish a foundation across curricular areas, promoting holistic learning and self-exploration through reading, writing, speaking, drawing, singing, and playing. This comprehensive approach encompasses physical education, art education, environmental education, languages, mathematics, basic science, and social science. This comprehensive approach ensures children are well-prepared both at the cognitive-sensitive and physical-pranic (emotional) levels to effortlessly transition to the Middle Stage. Adhering to the recommendations of the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), brought out as a follow-up to the NEP 2020, a new subject area called “Physical Education and Well-being” has been introduced at the Preparatory Stage. This subject aims to promote a love for physical activity and sports; develop capacities for skillful engagement in physical activity and sports; and develop resilience, empathy, and cooperation. India has a wonderful tradition of Yoga which is a wholesome experience for maintaining mind and body wellness. Physical Education and Well-being includes various aspects of Yoga starting from Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama and Dhyana in a progressive way from Grade 3 till the Secondary Stage. This lays the foundation for holistic health and well-being."}

Age-specific aspects of Yoga are designed to lay the foundation for healthy living. The textbook aligns with the competencies included in the NCF-SE 2023 for this stage. Khel Yoga for Grade 5 is in progression of Grade 4 textbook of physical education and well-being which emphasises the importance of physical activity and the values and dispositions essential for life. It incorporates cross-cutting themes, such as inclusion, gender equality, and cultural rootedness. The content and activities are designed to encourage peer group learning, and enrich the educational experience for students, teachers and community. While this textbook is valuable, students should also explore interesting local games and play with friends. This book is not only useful for school learning, but is a valuable resource for parents and community. While the play-way method continues, the nature of toys and games used for teaching evolves to enhance engagement rather than mere attraction. While this textbook is valuable, children should also explore additional resources on the subject. School libraries should facilitate this extended learning, and parents and teachers should support their endeavours. An effective learning environment motivates students, keeping them engaged and fostering curiosity and wonder vital for learning. With confidence, I recommend this textbook to all students and teachers at the Preparatory Stage. I extend my gratitude to everyone involved in its development, hopeful that it will meet expectations. As NCERT remains committed to systemic reforms and improving publication quality, we welcome feedback to refine the textbook content. \b Dinesh Prasad Saklani \b Director New Delhi\b National Council of Educational 31 March 2025 \b Research and Training"}

Physical activity is integral to human life and, therefore, integral to the school curriculum. For an individual student, sports and physical activities teach important motor skills, practices of physical fitness, socio- emotional awareness and regulation, associated cognitive abilities, as well as the values of self-discipline, hard work, teamwork, and a gracious acceptance of one’s strengths and vulnerabilities. Since ages India has recognised the centrality of a healthy body and healthy mind as part of any educational experience. A very rich heritage of physical activities and games such as wrestling, malkhamb, kalaripayattu, thang-ta, gatka and archery along with the practice of Yoga emphasise these connections between body, health, well-being, and the holistic development of the human being. The National Curriculum Framework for School Education 2023 (NCF-SE 2023) recognises the criticality of the health and well-being of individuals as a key factor for success in all other aspects of life. Considering the focus on holistic well-being, NCF-SE 2023 has mandated Physical Education and Well-being as a core curricular area for all stages of school education. To help teachers and students achieve the curricular goals of physical education and well-being, for the first time, a textbook has been designed for Grade 5. This book enables students to experience the joy of playing, explore diverse physical activities, think and discuss, learn to play together, and treat each other with kindness. The book has three units: Basic Motor Movements, Our Games, and Yoga. In Unit 1—Basic Motor Movements, students will engage in movements like throwing, catching, running, jumping, kicking, receiving and hitting with the help of advanced apparatus. Objects of different sizes, weights and texture are used to facilitate these diverse types of movements. This unit is a continuation of the play-based"}

In Chapter 4 of Unit 1 ‘Little Steps’, certain activities such as cart wheel, crab wheel, etc. require teacher’s attention towards the performers to avoid injuries. Children generally love to play games. While playing, they interact with other children, discuss rules, strive to excel, help each other and enjoy being together. In our country, we have many local traditional games from different regions played by children and elders. NCERT had released books for Grades 3 and 4 earlier in which the students have enjoyed playing games and learned so many personality traits. Some new games are included in Unit 2 — Our Games. It has 12 traditional games from different parts of the country. Instructions for how to play each game and illustrations showing the details are given in the book. It is possible that some of these games might be played differently in your region; you may customise the rules. After the presentation of each game, suggestions for variations in the rules are given to make the game more interesting and to encourage children to play these games at home with their family, friends community and society. These games can be played during family ceremonies, outings, picnics, vanbhraman. Unit 3—Yoga encourages students to foster holistic well-being. At this age, children are by nature happy and joyful. Yoga is introduced through interesting activities in a playful way to develop healthy habits and learn preparatory practices required for performing various Yogic techniques in higher classes. Introduction to Ashtanga Yoga (eight aspects of Yoga), and details about the Yoga unit for Grade 5, are given in the section Information for Physical Education Teachers at the end of the book. The yogic asanas, kriyas, mudras, pranayamas, etc. can be performed by the parents, grandparents, community persons, etc. for ensuring their holistic well-being but before trying to perform yogic activities please ensure the fitness levels as ascertained by the experts.

Sufficient time must be given for circle time during the physical education and well-being period. The aim of Circle time is to develop the above values and dispositions through Physical Education. After completion of the physical activity or game, all the students sit in a circle to share their experience during the activity. It is important to set some ground rules for circle time to ensure that all students get opportunities to express themselves. • Everyone in the circle is equal; no one is more important than the others. • Everybody should respect each other and their feelings. • No one must interrupt while another person is speaking. • Everyone in the circle must get the opportunity to speak, and others must pay attention to what they are saying. The teacher can guide the session by asking everyone to share their experience about the activity. Every student can share a star and a wish, and then ‘tag’ another student to share. The process continues till each student gets their turn. Some pertinent and thought provoking questions can be discussed during this session, like — Are we biased towards our friends when we play? Are we including everyone equally in a game? Are some people not having as much fun? Circle time can also involve engaging discussions related to the context of the game. For example, if someone is injured during the game, the teacher can choose to discuss ‘how to avoid injuries while playing’. Session Planning Physical education and well-being is allotted approximately 150 periods in the year. It is essential to plan these sessions effectively for the development of required competencies mentioned in NCF-SE 2023. The three units given in the book should not be completed in sequence; a detailed period-by-period suggestive session plan is given at the end of the book in the section Information for Physical Education Teachers.

For balanced development of skills and values, different types of activities may be planned in each period. Three types of sessions are given below to maximise learning in the given time: Type 1 Game practice. Type 2 \u0007Circle time after play to provide sufficient time for thinking and discussing socio-emotional aspects. Type 3 \u0007Gamified drills to focus on one specific skill. The following may be considered while planning a session: • Warm-up and cool-down activities at the beginning and at the end of each session to avoid injuries and facilitate quick recovery from physical activity. • Demonstration and modelling to help students understand what is expected of them. • Planning the right levels of challenge for different groups of students. • Planning should be focussed on the learning outcomes that need to be achieved. For example, jumping and hopping can be done through animal movement games like Mai Bhi Maindhak, and catching and hitting can be done through a hit and cover or corner tennis. Physical Education is important for both physical and mental health and development. It helps improve a child’s muscular and cardiovascular strength, flexibility, endurance, motor skills, and mind-body connection and wellness. It gives students the opportunity to set and strive for personal and achievable goals. Moreover, playing sports also helps students develop the qualities of teamwork, cooperation, problem-solving, discipline, perseverance, and responsibility. In general, physical activity is well established to be among the best for relaxation and facilitates emotional stability and resilience. All these qualities and benefits are also relevant to success in the classroom; studies show that students who stay physically active are more successful with other school work as well. Finally, people who are physically active as young people tend to stay more fit as adults as well, leading them to lead longer, healthier, and more productive lives."}

Instructions for Teachers For a joyful experience, the safety of children and the effective development of competencies, teachers may follow the instructions given below — • Ensure adequate play area to perform the activities given in the book. • Ensure that there are no obstructions in the play area and it is safe for students to play. • Ensure that a First Aid Kit is available and accessible. • Ensure that students feel emotionally and socially safe, and are treated with respect, encouragement, support, and have access to fair redressal of grievances during a Physical Education class. • For group activities, mark the area into smaller blocks to prevent students from running into each other. • While dividing students into teams, make sure that the division is fair and balanced in terms of bodyweight, height and skills required for the activity. • Encourage students to be aware of their surroundings while playing. • Instruct students not to aim at the opponent, unless told otherwise, while performing any movement. Discuss why this is important. • Encourage students to be considerate of teammate’s skills while practising. For example, if they hit the ball too hard and their teammate is not able to handle it, they must reduce the force. • Encourage students to be careful while pushing or pulling an opponent when participating in an activity that requires this. • Encourage students to treat each other with kindness, focus on enjoying the game and not just on the outcome of the game. • Encourage students to collect all equipment after their use. • Ensure active participation of all students in all activities. • Allow children to explore different types of materials and objects to play with, such as different sizes of softballs and bats, tyres, small spades (blunted), or any kind of local toy or object. Making a sand pit and having access to a small shallow water source can also be considered."}

In continuation to the basic motor movements that we learnt in Grades 3 and 4, we use our large muscles for movements such as jumping, throwing, catching, kicking, and hitting. These are known as gross motor skills, which play a vital role in everyday tasks, sports, and maintaining physical fitness. In contrast, fine motor skills involve the use of small muscles in our hands and fingers, which are helpful for more precise actions like writing, drawing, picking up small items, and gripping objects. Both gross and fine motor skills are essential components of basic motor development. There are five key motor movements that we emphasise: throwing, catching, kicking, receiving, and striking. The aim is to practice these skills through engaging activities using objects of various shapes, sizes, weights, and textures."}

Each key helps you open a part of the mystery box and discover an answer inside.

Why should I try to give away something that God has given me?” Kavya reached home but was very quiet. Her mother asked if something was wrong, but Kavya said she was fine. Later, her grandfather also asked if the teacher had scolded her. Kavya said no and tried to smile and act cheerful. The next day, Adya told the teacher she had lost her hair clip at school.

In yoga, it is said that when we slow down our breathing and take deep, calm breaths, it helps us control our mind (from too many thoughts). This makes it easier to focus and think clearly, helping us improve our concentration. We will begin our Pranayama practice with a revision of the Anuloma Viloma Pranayama.

{"id": "class 5__social studies class 5__p3__c1", "text": "The foundational stage in school education, as envisaged by the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, serves as the cornerstone for the holistic development of children. It enables students not only to imbibe the invaluable samskaras rooted in our country’s ethos and constitutional framework, but also to acquire basic literacy and numeracy. This foundation equips them to transition seamlessly into a more challenging preparatory stage. The preparatory stage acts as a bridge between the foundational and the middle stages, spanning three years from Grades 3 to 5. The education provided during this stage builds upon the pedagogical approaches of the foundational stage. While the play-way, discovery, and the activity-based learning methods continue, students are also introduced to textbooks and formal classroom settings. This introduction aims to establish a foundation across curricular areas, promoting holistic learning and self-exploration through reading, writing, speaking, thinking, drawing, singing, and playing. This comprehensive approach encompasses physical education, art education, environmental education, languages, mathematics, basic science and social sciences, ensuring that students are well-prepared both at the cognitive-sensitive and physical-emotional levels to effortlessly transition to the middle stage. Adhering to the recommendations of the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023, brought out, as a follow-up to the NEP 2020, a new subject area called ‘The World Around Us’ at the preparatory stage is introduced. This subject aims to provide environmental education through an experiential learning approach, connecting students’ experiences with the basic concepts of different subject areas, which they will study at the middle stage. Our Wondrous World, the textbook for The World Around Us, has been designed to help students connect their day-to-day learning about their world to the basic concepts of various subject areas — science, social sciences and environmental education. It aims to enhance their sensitivity towards their environment, develop skills to work with the community, and foster a positive attitude towards various professions. Our Wondrous World emphasises conceptual understanding, critical thinking, creativity, and the values and dispositions essential for this developmental stage. It incorporates cross-cutting themes such as inclusion, multilingualism, gender equality, and cultural rootedness, integrating appropriate ICT tools and school-based assessments. Foreword"}
{"id": "class 5__social studies class 5__p4__c1", "text": "iv In Grades 3 and 4, students were familiarised with units — Our Communities, Life Around Us, Health and Well-being, Things Around Us and Our Environment. Grade 5 being the final year of the preparatory stage enables students for the middle stage in a complimentary way. It lays a sound foundation for students in science and social science, so that they are ready to learn these subjects separately from middle stage. The Grade 5 students are familiarised with vibrant India, important role of water through the example of river Godavari, health and well-being at home and school, what and how of different things around the students, and the environment on and around the planet Earth. Content and processes have been designed by keeping in view the age, experiences, interests and diversity of students everywhere. This textbook also carries a wide range of interesting facts about India’s traditions, culture and achievements. Student’s innate curiosity at this stage needs to be nurtured by addressing their questions and designing activities based on the core learning principles. While the play-way method continues, the nature of toys and games used for teaching evolves to enhance the engagement rather than mere attraction. While this textbook is valuable, students also need to explore additional resources on the subject. School libraries should facilitate this extended learning, and parents and teachers should support their endeavours. An effective learning environment motivates students, keeps them engaged and fosters curiosity and wonder — vital for learning. I recommend this textbook with confidence to all students and teachers at the preparatory stage. I extend my gratitude to everyone involved in its development, hopeful that it will meet the expectations. As NCERT remains committed to systemic reforms and improving the publication quality, we welcome feedback to refine the textbook content. \b Dinesh Prasad Saklani \b Director New Delhi\b National Council of Educational 28 June 2025\b Research and Training"}
{"id": "class 5__social studies class 5__p5__c1", "text": "The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 in alignment with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has introduced The World Around Us (TWAU) as a core curricular area at the preparatory stage of school education for Grades 3 – 5. As described in NCF-SE 2023, it aims to address the natural curiosity of students and help them gain a more systematic understanding of the natural, physical and social environment in their immediate context. Guided by the policy and the curriculum framework, the TWAU textbook is designed as a learning companion that encourages observation, questioning, investigation, reflection, and expression among students. It integrates science, social science, environmental studies, and foundational and vocational skills into one cohesive narrative, promoting interdisciplinary thinking and action. Through this approach, students begin to recognise patterns, processes and relationships between people and nature, cause and consequence, tradition and change. The Grade 5 textbook of TWAU, Our Wondrous World, continues the journey from the foundations laid in Grades 3 and 4. As students progress into the final year of the preparatory stage, this book reinforces experiences of exploration, experiments, play and discovery by guiding learners toward more structured, yet interactive learning. The textbook embodies the core principles of experiential learning through nature walks, observations, interviews, model-making, experiments and surveys. Students are encouraged to apply the basics of the scientific methods — to observe, hypothesise, test and conclude. In doing so, they also develop environmental awareness, ethical reasoning, empathy and a sense of responsibility towards others, and the planet. With the vision of developing cognitive, emotional, and physical capacities through holistic and integrated learning, this textbook adopts a student-centric, activity-rich and inquiry-driven pedagogy. It also supports a gradual progression from immediate surroundings to broader contexts. This structured exploration of the environment is assumed to develop the competencies identified for preparatory stage through TWAU based on the curricular goals identified in NCF-SE 2023. While designing and developing the content and activities, effort has been made for providing students with varied experiences of exploring environment, which helps students to understand the interdependence in the world and develop sensitivity towards environmental, and social issues. Throughout the book, inputs have been given for students to recognise the importance of About the Textbook"}

Collection of data and their analysis through observation, experiments and social survey would surely provide seeds of skills of questioning, and arriving at probable solutions. The book also tries to provide basic understanding of the concepts that would be discussed in different disciplines at middle stage. In addition, the book provides experience of map reading and interpretation as tools of exploring the world. The Indian Knowledge System (IKS) is organically integrated, offering students a lens to value indigenous practices, local crafts, folklore, and the wisdom of communities. Language, mathematics, and arts are also naturally embedded through cross-disciplinary activities. Designed with inclusivity and diversity at its heart, this book provides unique experiences for learners of different abilities and backgrounds. It encourages collaborative learning, respects multilingual contexts, and fosters the values of care, cooperation and democratic citizenship. The textbook has 10 chapters, structured into five thoughtfully curated units — Life Around Us, Health and Well-being, Incredible India, Things Around Us and Our Amazing Planet. The book provides opportunities for students to engage with real-life issues, local knowledge systems, and diverse cultures spread across our nation. Each unit has briefly outlined the desired competencies and the concepts covered. It is attempted to follow different approaches in each chapter. In the form of a narrative, Chapter 1: ‘Water — The Essence of Life’ emphasises how we need to be responsible and why it is important to maintain the balance in nature. This is followed by Chapter 2: ‘Journey of a River’ which is written in the form of an autobiography of the river Godavari to show how environmental, social and economic aspects are interconnected. Chapter 3: ‘The Mystery of Food’ uses an exploratory style, emphasising looking at things in the world around us that we do not see with the naked eye, for example, the discussion on microbes. Chapter 4: ‘Our School — A Happy Place’ is based on research, planning and action. Chapter 5: ‘Our Vibrant Country’ is about learning through things that are around us that we have not noticed or examined like the currency notes. Chapter 6: ‘Some Unique Places’ is a travelogue about discovering unique places in India, while Chapters 7 and 8 use activities and experiments to engage students. Chapter 7: ‘Energy — How Things Work’ and Chapter 8: ‘Clothes — How Things are Made’ are extension of the themes — how things work and how things are made as discussed in Grades 3 and 4. Chapter 9: ‘Rhythms of Nature’ gets students to note observations in the journal provided at the back of the book. Looking at things from historical perspectives"}

In the chapter, we are also highlighting the connections between what we do and the environment around us. In brief, the students are exposed to the world around us, how it is made, where things come from, what is their history, how we could be vulnerable and how we can act responsibly by understanding how the world around us is interconnected and how our ancient Indian philosophy of treating the world as one family, ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’, is important for sustainability. This book provides scope for students to record their observations in four quarters of the year in ‘Seasons’ Journal’ at the end. Teachers would guide students for doing so. Assessment is integrated into the learning process through reflective exercises, projects, group work, and creative expressions. ‘Let us reflect’ sections promote self-assessment and metacognition in alignment with the competencies given in the NCF-SE. Questions are placed in the book to promote critical thinking. The teacher needs to be more of a facilitator than someone who has all the answers. The teacher is encouraged to vary and extend the activities in the book as well as to initiate discussion in the classroom. The intention is to encourage the spirit of inquiry and openness to questions that may seem outside the curriculum. Some of these may deserve a discussion, if not an answer. ‘Notes to the Teacher’ offers guidance on facilitating rich classroom discussions and adapting content to local contexts. It is also important that teachers use adequate learning teaching materials such as maps and globes as without these, the designed activities would be incomplete and there is fear of achieving the competencies. Ultimately, Our Wondrous World aims to kindle a lifelong curiosity and joy in learning, enabling students to see their lives as part of a larger, interconnected world. It serves as a bridge between lived experiences and abstract ideas, between the local and the global, and between learning and living. The book has been designed as an exciting tool for the hands of the teacher and the student. The book aims to inculcate a sense of pride in India’s rich diversity, which is our strength. We hope that this textbook will provide a strong foundation for developing a wide range of competencies in students in the years ahead. \b Dhanya Krishnan \b Associate Professor and Member Coordinator \b Department of Elementary Education \b National Council of Educational \b Research and Training, New Delhi"}

{"id": "class 5__social studies class 5__p18__c1", "text": "How to Facilitate • Encourage students to think about water bodies near their homes or schools. Inspire them to explore where the water comes from and where it goes. • The Activity 6 in Chapter 1 on mustard seed shows how rivers flow from higher to lower ground and follow the shape of the land. Use the map of India to explore which rivers flow into which seas and how landforms (like mountains) guide their direction. • Talk about what happens to rainwater in their school or neighbourhood. Use this to start a conversation on how cities and villages plan for water. • Help students list different ways in which water plays an important role in our life. Connect this to ideas of sharing and saving water. Let them think about how water is stored in their homes (tanks, pots, etc.) and how a dam works as a big water storing unit. • Engage students in role-plays to critically think about both the scarcity and excess of water. • Encourage students to discuss with their parents or grandparents about festivals, stories, or memories connected to rivers. This will help them see rivers not just as physical things, but as part of their community and culture. Note to the Teacher This unit includes two chapters: Chapter 1 ‘Water — The Essence of Life’ and Chapter 2 ‘Journey of a River’. Following are the key concepts covered in these chapters. Chapter 1: Water — The Essence of Life • ‘Water — The Essence of Life’ introduces students to its various forms and different sources (freshwater and saltwater) of water. It also highlights the importance of water in different activities in the society. This chapter introduces the continuous movement of water in different forms through the water cycle. It also explores how water shapes the land and supports life in freshwater habitats, and highlights the need to conserve water. Chapter 2: Journey of a River • This chapter follows the story of the river Godavari from its origin to its delta.

Similarly in nature, heat causes water from different sources, like oceans and rivers, to become water vapour. Water vapour forms the clouds, which come down as rain, snow and hail. This water goes back into rivers, lakes and oceans. This constant circular movement of water in nature is called the water cycle.

In cities with many cemented surfaces, rainwater cannot go into the ground easily, which stops groundwater from getting recharged. Open, uncovered areas allow water to seep into the ground.

Then, she asked, “Do you know there are actually two images of him on each note? Hold the note up to the light and see what you can find!”. We all looked at the note in light. We were surprised to see a smaller image of Gandhi ji which we had not seen before. “Did you notice the tiny round spectacles on the currency note?” These spectacles are the symbol of a nationwide mission called ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’ (Clean India Mission). The symbol is based on the spectacles of Gandhi ji. When we asked our teacher why this was so, she said Gandhi ji was very particular that everyone should keep their surroundings clean. People who lived in his ashram followed strict rules of cleanliness. Some currency notes also have raised prints and symbols to help people with visual impairment identify them. The MANI app helps them in identifying different currency notes by listening to and feeling their vibrations. Do you know?

Symbols that Speak Just like the emblem, our national symbols also remind us of who we are and what makes us proud to be the citizens of India. A long time ago, lions used to roam freely over vast areas of India. Today, these lions are found only in the Gir forests of Gujarat. Their numbers had gone down to only a few dozen about 150 years ago.

As found in a forest, diversity makes our country stronger and more self-sufficient. Diversity Everywhere Think of the variety of headgear we see in our country! In Rajasthan, men wear a colourful saafa or pagri. In Himachal Pradesh, people wear a topi. Headgear can tell us where someone is from, what they believe in or what they do for a living.

In Grades 3 and 4, students have engaged with local toys like (spinners and paper boats) to understand how they work. They have also learned about how things are made by exploring the processes of bricks, paper, etc. While making things with locally available materials students learn useful methods of sustainable development, including refuse, reduce, reuse, repurpose and recycle (the 5 R s) so that they can make responsible decisions. By making things with their own hands, they develop a deeper appreciation for the materials we use in everyday life, and also learn to connect and care for their environment. In Grade 5, this unit invites students to explore how everyday things, like energy and cloth, are made and used. Through simple activities and local examples, they learn how energy enables movement and light, how threads become fabric, and why reusing things and clean energy matter. It helps them see the unseen processes behind familiar things in their homes and surroundings."}

Note to the Teacher The unit consists of two chapters: Chapter 7 ‘Energy — How Things Work’ and Chapter 8 ‘Clothes — How Things are Made’. Chapter 7: Energy — How Things Work • ‘Energy — How Things Work’ introduces students to the concept of energy by connecting it with everyday experiences. They learn about the different forms of energy used at home and society. Through hands-on activities and examples, students explore how energy makes things work, and the importance of using clean and efficient energy. The simple hands-on activities enable students to play and learn about energy, and its possible uses. Chapter 8: Clothes — How Things are Made • ‘Clothes — How Things are Made’ explores how cloth is made; starting from natural patterns like birds weaving nests, to human methods of spinning, weaving and stitching. Through hands-on activities and stories from across India, students learn how threads become fabric, discover local traditions like handloom and embroidery, and understand the value of reuse, recycling and creativity in everyday materials."}

When we do not eat, we may feel tired, and when we eat, we feel active and ready to play. What do you think could be the reason? This is because the food we eat gives us the energy we need”. In some places of Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Ladakh, people often keep their cattle on the ground floor of their houses, while the family lives on the floor above.

The male baya weaver is a weaverbird, who builds beautiful hanging nests from grass. They weave the strands over and under to make the nest strong. The nest is shaped like a pouch and hangs from the branches of a tree. The expert weaverbird weaves very fine nests, while the young ones who are just learning make rather rough ones. Weaving combines strips or threads of a material into a patterned fabric like cloth. One set of thread is placed vertically and the other goes horizontally. When these threads are carefully crossed over and under each other, they form a unified fabric such as a mat, a basket or many other things. For a long time, people have been weaving many kinds of natural materials into mats, baskets or sheets from coconut fibre or palm reeds, bamboo, grass, jute and cotton or silk."}

Step 3: Tracking Changes in a Year It is time to take a closer look at the patterns of change you have noticed throughout the year. Let us form five groups. Each group can choose one theme from the chart and study the patterns of change observed across different time periods during the year. Group 1: Plant life Group 2: Birds and animals Group 3: Air, heat and light Group 4: Water and water bodies Group 5: Human activities Create a poster on your theme. Present how your theme changed throughout the year. Be creative! For example Group 1 will show how plants changed in different months — like leaves, flowers or fruits.

Use these observations to create a short story about your time period (for example, January – March), linking what you saw in nature with what you have noticed in people’s lives. Read it out in the class. Discovering Seasons We have seen how plants change, how animals behave, how the air feels, what happens with water and what people do throughout the year. You now know that nature changes slowly over the year. The weather warms up, gets hot and then it rains, and then it gets cooler before warming up again. We observed these changes throughout the year, but do you think the same things happened last year too? Will they happen again the next year? Yes! These changes follow a pattern, a natural rhythm that repeats itself every year. This repeating pattern in nature is what we call seasons. What are the seasons called in your region? India hosts both the wettest place on Earth — Mawsynram in Meghalaya—and one of the driest — the Thar Desert."}

In this way, seasons not only shape what we do, but also teach us about the cycles of life. By understanding the seasons, we understand how life moves in cycles.
