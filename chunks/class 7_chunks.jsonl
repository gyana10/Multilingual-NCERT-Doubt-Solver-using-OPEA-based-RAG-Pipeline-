{"id": "class 7__english__p3__c1", "text": "FOREWORD The National Education Policy 2020 envisages a system of education in the country that is rooted in Indian ethos and its civilisational accomplishments in all domains of human endeavour and knowledge while at the same time preparing the students to constructively engage with the prospects and challenges of the 21st century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured the students’ inherent abilities touching upon all the five planes of human existence, the pañchakośhas in the Foundational and the Preparatory Stages have paved the way for the progression of their learning further at the Middle Stage. Thus, the Middle Stage acts as a bridge between the Preparatory and the Secondary Stages, spanning three years from Grade 6 to Grade 8. The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects in three languages—including at least two languages native to India—Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy—a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. Poorvi, the English language textbook for Grade 7 is one of these. Its content comprises stories, poems, and narratives that ensure a reflection of their social, cultural, and geographical landscapes wherein students are sure to find traces of their lived experiences. Poorvi also weaves into its contents"}

However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook, and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years. \b Dinesh Prasad Saklani \b Director, New Delhi\b National Council of Educational February 2025\b Research and Training"}
{"id": "class 7__english__p5__c1", "text": "Poorvi, a textbook of English for Grade 7, is developed in alignment with the vision of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023. Language education is essential for effective communication, aesthetic expression and appreciation. Reasoning and critical thinking are very closely linked with language use, and these are valuable capacities to be developed. Language development plays an important role in the development of perceptual and practical concepts, and also enables us to check our experiences with others to ensure that we have a shared meaning emerging from these experiences. The textual material developed for the Middle Stage will take children well beyond the Preparatory Stage. Curricular Goals, competencies, and learning outcomes have been the guiding principles while developing the textbook. The Curricular Goals (CG) cover a range of competencies. The NCF-SE 2023 has stated the following Curricular Goals: CG-1: Develops independent reading, comprehension, and summarising skills of a variety of texts (stories, poems, extracts of plays, essays, articles, and news reports). CG-2: Attains the ability to write about thoughts, feelings, and experiences of social events. CG-3: Develops the capacity for effective communication using language skills for questioning, describing, analysing, and responding. CG-4: Explores different literary devices and forms of literature. CG-5: Develops the ability to recognise basic linguistic aspects (word and sentence structure) and use them in oral and written expression. CG-6: Develops an appreciation of the distinctive features of the language, including its alphabet and script, sounds, rhymes, puns, and other wordplays and games unique to the language (pp. 245–246). The Curricular Goals have been covered through a variety of themes and an array of activities. There are five thematic units that comprise stories, poems, conversation, narrative and descriptive pieces. Themes such as learning together, wit and humour, dreams and discoveries, travel and adventure and homage to bravehearts have been included. Cross-cutting themes, such as Indian Knowledge Systems, values, heritage, gender sensitivity, and inclusion have been integrated in all the units. Each unit has three literary pieces―story, poem, conversation or non-fiction. ABOUT THE BOOK"}
{"id": "class 7__english__p6__c1", "text": "vi vi There are in-text questions, ‘Let us discuss’ to assess comprehension of the text. The end-of-the-text questions given in ‘Let us think and reflect’ are designed to encourage critical thinking, reasoning, responding, analysing, etc. Unit 1 — ‘Learning Together’ encourages students to explore the interconnectedness of nature and human life. The story, ‘The Day the River Spoke’, emphasises the importance of respecting and listening to nature. The river encourages Jahnavi to overcome her fears and societal barriers by boldly pursuing her desire for education, assuring that her courage can make a difference. The poem, ‘Try Again’ inspires resilience and the power of perseverance, encouraging students to view challenges as stepping stones to success. The poem leaves a powerful impact on the readers, inspiring them to achieve their best goal in life. ‘Three Days to See’ presents a touching narrative of a girl who cannot see and that invites learners to appreciate their senses and value the beauty of the world around them. Unit 2 — ‘Wit and Humour’ engages students with a light-hearted story, poem, and play. These delightful works showcase the charm of intelligence, humour and laughter. The amusing tale of ‘Animals, Birds, and Dr. Dolittle’ will help students explore the idea of a doctor who learns animal language. He not only communicates with animals but also treats their ailments with empathy. The story is a fable that entertains and also educates about animal care. The poem, ‘A Funny Man’ celebrates humour which can be unfamiliar that can spark curiosity and amusement. ‘Say the Right Thing’ highlights the comic consequences of miscommunication. The play focuses on the fact that it is important to say the right thing at the right time. We must listen carefully to what others are saying and we must think before we speak. Unit 3 — ‘Dreams and Discoveries’ captures the essence of wonder and imagination of children. It also sparks curiosity and creativity, encouraging students to explore how dreams and discoveries shape the world. ‘My Brother’s Great Invention’ is a humorous story about a boy who likes to discover new things around him. This leads to an unexpected encounter with a thief. The story highlights determination, creativity, and sibling bonds, teaching students the value of trial and error in discovery. The poem ‘Paper Boats’ uses the imagery of paper boats to symbolise dreams and aspirations. Students will reflect on the joy of simple pleasures and the universal desire to connect with the unknown. ‘North, South, East, West’ will help students appreciate the diversity that exists in our country. The narrative presents postcards from a girl exploring India’s diverse landscapes with her parents. The vibrant observations will foster an appreciation for the country’s rich cultural and natural heritage."}
{"id": "class 7__english__p7__c1", "text": "vii Unit 4 — ‘Travel and Adventure’ ignites the spirit of exploration and aims to cultivate curiosity, resilience, and a sense of wonder. The story, ‘The Tunnel’ will take students on an adventurous episode in a tunnel, highlighting the excitement of discovery and the courage to face the unknown. It also conveys the concept of maturing through self-exploration. The poem, ‘Travel’ revolves around the theme of exploring the unknown and a strong desire to travel. Train is used as a symbol to embark on to new adventures with new people. The sun’s journey is used as a metaphor for constant movement and the human urge for exploration. ‘Conquering the Summit’ is a non-fiction piece on Arunima Sinha, the first female amputee to scale Mount Everest to accomplish her dream. This will inspire students with her extraordinary determination and perseverance. Unit 5 — ‘Bravehearts’ instills a sense of patriotism and gratitude in students, celebrating the courage and sacrifices of the valiant who have selflessly laid down their lives for the nation. ‘A Homage to Our Brave Soldiers’ is a tribute to the real heroes of our nation—our soldiers, the embodiment of patriotism. The poem ‘My Dear Soldiers’ is a heartfelt acknowledgement of the courage, dedication, and sacrifice of the soldiers who tirelessly defend the nation, often in harsh and unforgiving conditions. The graphic story of ‘Rani Abbakka’ is a tale of a fearless queen, who defied Portuguese colonial powers with resilience and military acumen. She exhibited indomitable courage, valour, and determination. These literary pieces serve not only as sources of entertainment but also as repositories of valuable life lessons, fostering personal growth and equipping children with skills to navigate social situations with confidence. By resonating with children’s daily experiences, the selected pieces promote positive values such as resilience, empathy, and emotional intelligence, thereby exerting a profound impact on their overall development. The primary focus lies in cultivating competencies in listening, speaking, reading, and writing while concurrently developing vocabulary and grammar in context. Language learning truly comes to life when connected to the immediate environment of learners, allowing them to express their thoughts, feelings, and experiences through experiential learning. All the activities are conveniently colour coded under headings such as―‘Let us discuss’, ‘Let us think and reflect’, ‘Let us speak’, ‘Let us listen’, ‘Let us learn’, ‘Let us write’ and ‘Let us explore’. ‘Let us Explore’ extends learning beyond the text, staying within the unit’s theme. It aims to connect students with the Indian Knowledge System, fostering an appreciation for our rich heritage and culture, encouraging students to delve deeper, engage in"}

Poorvi The textbook of English for Grade 7 is titled Poorvi after the Indian rāga ‘Poorvi’. This rāga is said to promote harmony and serenity. It is associated with dusk, specifically sunset time (Sandhi Prakash). Each rāga in Indian music carries its own emotional significance and is symbolically connected to certain seasons, times of day, and moods. Rāgas are believed to evoke specific emotions in listeners. Poorvi is an ancient and traditional Hindustani classical rāga that originated in eastern India. It is typically performed during the fourth prahar of the day, between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. It evokes a sense of calmness and contemplation in the journey of learners, symbolising a harmonious blend of traditional and modern learning."}

And another. A kingfisher swept down, its wings an arrow of blue in the sunlight. And a green lizard slithered down to the river’s edge to bask in the sun. “Dear, dear!” said a sleepy, murmuring voice, “What’s the matter?” Jahnavi was startled, because she was sure she had been quite alone. It couldn’t have been the lizard. And the kingfisher was up in the thicket of bamboo eating the fish it had caught. It couldn’t be the parrots, because parrots shrieked and this was such a sleepy voice. She looked around her. There wasn’t a soul in sight. She was rather scared and wanted to run away. “You shouldn’t cry, you know,” the voice went on. “And you really shouldn’t be scared, when you have been coming here to see me every day, well, almost every day.”"}

Maybe later.’ ” But when she was five, little Ramu was born and Mother still said, “Maybe next year. Jahnavi, mind your little brother while I go to the fields.” Now, she was nearly ten and minding Little Appu, who was the smallest. “They don’t want me. They only...”—she stopped with a sob... “I am scared to go to school. And I’m so old now, they’ll never let me go. But I want to go. I want to learn to read like Ettan and Meena.” Jahnavi called her brother ‘Ettan’. Ettan means ‘Elder brother’, but his real name was Gopi. “I want to know why spiders are yellow in yellow flowers, why bamboo trees rustle, why the moon always comes from behind the hills, never the other way, why the baby fish in the field water become frogs, why...” “Stop!” said the River. “You make me breathless.

I’m afraid there’s only one thing you can do.” “Can I do something?” asked Jahnavi. “Well, it’s up to you,” said the River. “Seems to me little girls can do as much as little boys—they swim as fast as little boys. You just slip along one morning and sit there in the school and listen to what’s going on, and maybe the teacher will let you stay.” “I couldn’t,” gasped Jahnavi. “I couldn’t! They’d scare me! They’d chase me out.” The River laughed. “You? Scared?” the River said, “when you’re not afraid of the green lizard, or of the snake in the bamboo clump, (Jahnavi startled) or the big trains rattling past that bridge.” “Trains are noisy; I prefer ships,” said the River. Jahnavi never knew the snake lived in the bamboo clump. “What are ships?” she asked. “Big boats,” said the River, “so big that they can take hundreds of people, and they sail along the sea with lights that shine all night.” Jahnavi held her breath. “Will they come here?” she asked. “I’m afraid not,” said the River. “Too large, you know. Chandu’s catamaran is good enough for me. Chandu can take you to see a ship, someday.” “They’d never let me!” wailed Jahnavi. “Try going to school first,” said the River. “Remember—it’s up to you!” wailed: (here) complained in a loud voice catamaran: a kind of boat clump: a small group of trees growing together rattling: noise made by shaking things 4"}

The next day she reached the school, panting and out of breath and stood by the door listening while the teacher read out the lesson. It was a story about a prince called Asˊ hoka, who became a great king. Little Appu had fallen asleep on her shoulder. She crept nearer and nearer till she was in the back row, squatting with the others on the earthen floor. Little Appu made no noise and she listened. “Where did you spring from, little girl?” asked the teacher. “And what is your name? You’re new in my class.” “She’s Gopi’s sister, Gopi is in the next class,” said one of the boys. “It’s Jahnavi,” said another. “So, you’re Gopi’s little sister? Nice lad, Gopi.” “If you really, really want to come to my school, Jahnavi,” the teacher had said, “we’ll talk to your father about it. Don’t you worry. We’ll find a way.” Jahnavi saw the teacher walking up the steps to their gate the next evening when she was lighting the lamp. She could see her father scratching his cheek the way he did when he was worried and the teacher was nodding and saying something she couldn’t make out. And Mother said, “Little Jahnavi, I shall miss you when you go to school. Girls should learn as much as they want.

Hello everyone, I’m sure you have enjoyed learning about King Bruce and the spider. Let me share another story with you. In a thick green forest, there lived a little ant. She was known for her determination and never-give-up attitude. One sunny day, the ant found a delicious piece of roti that was too big for her to carry alone. “This crumb is huge, but I must get it back to the anthill. My family will be so happy!” she thought to herself. She tried to lift the crumb with all her might, but it was too heavy. She tried pushing it, pulling it and even rolling it, but nothing seemed to work. Exhausted and saddened, she sat down and began to cry. As the ant sat there, feeling beaten, she noticed a small bird nearby. The bird was trying to build a nest. It picked up twigs and leaves, but every time it tried to place them, the wind would blow them away. However, the bird did not give up. It kept trying, over and over again, until finally, it managed to build a strong nest. Poorvi 40"}

Determined once more, the ant gathered all her strength and decided to try again. She called her fellow ants for help. Together, they formed a chain and lifted the crumb with their combined strength. Slowly but surely, they carried the crumb back to the anthill. “We did it! Thank you, everyone! We showed that with teamwork and never giving up, we can achieve anything!” the ant shouted, excited and grateful. She and her friends celebrated their success. We too should learn this lesson from the ant’s experience—never give up, no matter how difficult the situation may seem. Hope you all liked the story. Thank you! 2.

For the visually impaired, it means access to assistive technologies like screen readers, voice-over- enabled smartphones and apps that can make daily activities easier. Anuj : Ohh... interesting. What is a screen reader, Ma? Mother : I knew you’d ask about it! Well, a screen reader is a software application that helps people who are visually impaired use computers and smartphones. It reads out the text displayed on the screen and provides audio feedback. Anuj : That’s amazing! So, Tara can use a computer just like we do? Mother : Yes, she can. Anuj : So, it makes a big difference in their daily lives. Mother : It certainly does. It ensures that people who are visually impaired can use digital services independently, without help from others. This can improve their quality of life. It also opens up more job opportunities in fields like IT, banking, and more, where they can work just efficiently like anybody else. Anuj : Wow! So that means people who are visually impaired can work and do things on their own? I’m so proud of my school. Mother : Yes, and this way, we can ensure that the benefits of Digital India reach everyone, helping them to participate fully in all areas of life.

The parrot, Polynesia, was sitting in the window looking out at the rain and singing a sailor song to herself. She stopped singing and started to listen. “You see, Doctor,” the Cat’s-food-Man went on, “you know all about animals—much more than what these vets here do. That book you wrote—about cats, why, it’s wonderful! I can’t read or write myself—my wife, Theodosia, is a scholar, and she read your book to me. You might have been a cat yourself.

Be an animal doctor. Give the silly people up—if they haven’t brains enough to see you’re the best doctor in the world. Take care of animals instead— they’ll soon find it out.

This is interesting—very interesting—something quite new. Give me the Birds’ A.B.C. first—slowly now.” So that was the way the Doctor came to know that animals had a language of their own and could talk to one another. And all that afternoon, while it was raining, Polynesia sat on the kitchen table giving him bird words to put down in the book. At teatime, when the dog, Jip, came in, the parrot said to the Doctor, “See, he’s talking to you.” “Looks to me as though he were scratching his ear,” said the Doctor. “But animals don’t always speak with their mouths,” said the parrot in a high voice, raising her eyebrows. “They talk with their ears, with their feet, with their tails—with everything.

And whenever any creatures got sick—not only horses and cows and dogs—but all the little things of the fields, like harvest mice, badgers, and bats, all came at once to his house on the edge of the town, so that his big garden was nearly always crowded with animals trying to get in to see him.

Ma rushed in to see what the racket was all about and found Papa standing there, sopping wet and scowling. “I want to know who is behind this nonsense,” Papa said grimly. “I think it’s supposed to be a burglar alarm,” Ma said, in a soothing voice. “I don’t care what it’s supposed to be,” Papa said. “Where’s that boy? I’m sure he rigged this up.” Anand had vanished by this time and reappeared only after dinner when Papa had cooled down. Before this story, let me put you in the picture. I am Anita, fourteen years old. My brother Anand, one year younger than me, caused all that hoo-ha with his burglar alarm. And this is not the first time he’s got on Papa’s nerves or frightened someone half to death in the house. The trouble with him is that he thinks he is a scientist. He loves tinkering with all sorts of electrical gadgets, tools, dynamos, planks of wood, and things like that. And he keeps creating ‘inventions’ that never work out as they are supposed to. Recently there had been a rush of thefts in the colony and Anand had got it into his head that what was needed was a burglar alarm. So, the minute Papa left for the office and Ma for the market, he started on his latest scheme. As usual I had to be involved, though I’d have preferred to finish my novel. “If you get a shelling, don’t bring me in,” I warned Anand. “Nothing will go wrong this time. I’ve planned it out carefully. See the blueprint.” racket: a loud and disturbing noise scowling: having an angry or frowning expression rigged up: assembled something temporarily tinkering: experimenting or fiddling dynamos: electric generator sopping: soaking"}

I’ve rigged it up so that the alarm works only when the door is opened gently.” I was sceptical. “Remember, if Papa asks, I’m not involved,” I warned. “Now clean up this mess before anyone gets home.” As you already know, my doubts about the alarm were quite justified. Papa, who always opens the door softly, was thoroughly soaked and angry as angry could be. Anyway, for a week after this, Anand did not dare try out anything new. Then we saw this film ‘Back to the Future’. I don’t know if you have seen it, but it’s all about a time machine. Well, that was stealthily: quietly or carefully so that one is not seen or heard sceptical: doubtful smugly: proudly clanging: a loud ringing sound like that of a metal being hit elaborate: detailed Anand loves words like blueprint—it makes him feel professional! Anyway, I looked at the elaborate drawing of doors, wires, and bells and asked, “How does this thing work?” “It’s quite simple. The moment the door opens, this alarm is tripped off and makes a clanging sound. Then this water bag here is loosened and falls on the thief’s head. By then we call the police—simple!” “But how does the alarm know that a burglar is opening the door?” “I’ve taken care of that,” Anand said loftily. I had the end of peace and quiet in the house. My brother decided that he had to make a time machine too. Papa locked up his tool box and hid the key while Ma kept a wary eye on her oven and mixer.

As for Anand, he went around looking like a savage. When Ma didn’t notice, the fellow didn’t even comb his hair. Anand just wouldn’t let anyone into his room. Finally, after a fortnight of frantic activity, the time machine was ready. “We can try it out tonight,” Anand announced to everyone at home at lunch time. “I don’t know what you’ve been up to in that room, but you’re not trying out anything new,” Papa said firmly. “But it’s a time machine! I’ve invented it,” Anand protested. “When I say NO, I mean NO,” Papa said, glaring. “Poor boy,” Ma said noticing Anand’s crestfallen look. “At least let’s take a look at it.” Papa sighed. “All right, but if the house falls, it’s your fault.” As it turned out, we could not try out the time machine that day at all. The next day, Papa and Ma were going to Kharagpur, a few hours away from Calcutta (now Kolkata), for a wedding. Ma was worried about leaving us alone, but we reassured her. “We’re old enough to look after ourselves, Ma,” I said. “And we can go next door to Sharma Aunty if we need anything.” “And it’s only one night,” Anand added. “All right. But promise me you won’t do anything with that time machine till we come back,” Ma said sternly, looking at Anand. He promised half-heartedly, offended at this lack of respect for his creation.

At about eleven thirty I thought I heard a scratching at the front door. Telling myself it was only my imagination, I went back to the book. A little later there was a rattle and a click. I was really scared, I can tell you, what with a murder story before me and then strange noises in the middle of the night! I shook Anand and whispered, “Listen, there’s someone at the door.” “Go and open it then,” he muttered groggily. “You silly! Someone’s trying to get in,” I said. Anand sat up. “Who? What?” “I don’t know,” I said. “What shall we do?” “Let’s holler for help,” he said. Before we could do anything, the door swung open and we found ourselves looking at a ruffianly fellow with a green scarf around his neck. Anand gasped. “Hey, it’s Boppa!” I whispered. It was indeed the fellow who had recently begun sweeping out the compounds in our row of houses. So, he was the thief, and no wonder. He knew exactly when the occupants were out, leaving the coast clear. The fellow gave an evil grin. “One squeak out of you and see what happens,” he said, brandishing his cudgel and backing out of the room.

More strange noises emerged from the next room—a few muffled thumps, an eerie whine, and a low, humming sound. “My time machine, he’s started it!” Anand gasped. “I wish we could get out of this room and see what is happening out there.” There was another howl, much fainter this time, and a great deal of clattering. We shouted for all we were worth. In a few minutes, we heard footsteps running up our drive.

(When the subject of a sentence has two or more nouns or pronouns that are connected by ‘and’, we use a plural verb). 2. It’s hot, dry, and there is sand everywhere. (In case the subject is ‘it’, the verb that follows is either ‘is’ or ‘was’ depending on the tense of the sentence). 3. There are so many hills here, and beaches too. (When we begin a sentence with ‘there’, the subject comes after the verb). The subject of a sentence is closely linked to the verb. The verb form changes depending on whether the subject is singular or plural and if it is in the third person. Choosing the correct verb based on the subject is called subject-verb agreement. Let us understand subject-verb agreement better. • A subject and its verb must agree, even if other words or phrases come between them. The formation of paragraphs is important in writing. • When the subjects are considered individually, we use a singular verb. Every man and woman has the right to vote. • Collective nouns such as ‘class’, ‘committee’, ‘audience’, ‘team’ can be singular or plural, based on the context of the sentence. If the sentence implies the group is acting as one unit, the noun is singular and takes a singular verb. The committee decides on the new policy tomorrow. • The indefinite pronouns ‘each’, ‘either’, ‘every’, ‘much’, and ‘neither’ always require singular verbs. Each of the children was given a gift. • Subjects that look plural because they end in ‘s’ but refer to one thing are singular. Mathematics is an interesting subject. • Some nouns (like glasses, scissors, pants, and tongs) are plural but take a singular verb when the phrase ‘pair of’ is placed before it. Here, ‘pair’ is the subject. This pair of scissors is sharp. 130 Poorvi"}

Back then, paper was really expensive, so it was only used for special occasions, like religious ceremonies. Sai : Wow, I didn’t know that. So, it wasn’t just for doing crafts? Father : It wasn’t until the seventeenth century that people began making animals, flowers and other designs just for fun. Sai : So, people have been making paper cranes for hundreds of years? Father : Yes, and the crane is especially important in Japanese culture. It’s a symbol of peace and long life. There’s even a belief that if you fold a thousand paper cranes, you can make a wish, and it will come true. Sai : A thousand cranes? That’s a lot! But it sounds like a really nice tradition. Father : It is. Origami isn’t just about the final shape—it’s about the process, the patience and the creativity involved. And over the years, it’s spread all over the world, with people adding their own styles and techniques. Sai : I had no idea origami had such a long history.

North, South, East, West Let us listen (refer to page 131) You will listen to a girl speak about the story of how Agartala got its name and the importance of agar. As you listen, choose the correct option for the questions given below. Hi everyone, We all know that Agartala is the capital of Tripura. But did you know how Agartala got its name? It’s made up of two words: ‘agar’, which is a type of tree, and ‘tala’, meaning underneath. So, Agartala means ‘under the agar tree’. These trees are also called aloeswood, eaglewood, or gharuwood. It is also referred to as ‘wood of the gods’. Agarwood, the wood from these trees, is really special. It smells amazing—like a mix of woody and flowery scents. It is one of the rarest and the most expensive woods in the world. People have used it for thousands of years in medicines, perfumes and rituals. It has been described as early as 1400 BCE in the Vedas. The Egyptians are believed to have used agarwood incense as part of their rituals more than 3,000 years ago. Here’s something even more remarkable—agarwood only forms when the tree is hurt or infected with a bug or virus. Instead of dying, the tree creates this dark, sticky, sweet-smelling substance called agar oil which protects it from further infection. Agarwood is very important to people in Agartala. It’s used to make perfumes, incense, and the hand carvings which Tripura is famous for. And here’s the best part: the tree was once almost extinct, but now, thanks to people taking care of it, you can find it in almost every house in northern Tripura. How great is that! 138 Poorvi"}

The railway lines were two straight black serpents disappearing into the tunnel in the hillside. Suraj stood near the cutting, waiting for the midday train. It wasn’t a station, and he wasn’t catching a train. He was waiting so that he could watch the steam engine come roaring out of the tunnel. He had cycled out of the town and taken the jungle path until he had come to a small village. He had left the cycle there, and walked over a low scrub-covered hill and down to the tunnel exit.

A second or two later, the steam engine shot out of the tunnel, snorting and puffing like some green, black, and gold dragon, some beautiful monster out of Suraj’s dreams. Showering sparks left and right, it roared a challenge to the jungle. Instinctively, Suraj stepped back a few paces. Waves of hot steam struck him in the face. Even the trees seemed to flinch from the noise and heat. And then the train had gone, leaving only a plume of smoke to drift lazily over the tall shisham trees. The jungle was still again. No one moved. Suraj turned from his contemplation of the drifting smoke and began walking along the embankment towards the tunnel. The tunnel grew darker as he walked further into it. When he had gone about twenty yards, it became pitch dark. Suraj had to turn and look back at the opening to reassure himself that there was still daylight outside.

He had simply wanted to walk through, so that he would know what the inside of a tunnel was really like. The walls were damp and sticky. A bat flew past. A lizard scuttled between the lines. Coming straight from the darkness into the light, Suraj was dazzled by the sudden glare and put a hand up to shade his eyes.

Marigolds grew in front of the hut, and at the back there was a small vegetable patch. It was the watchman’s duty to inspect the tunnel and keep it clear of obstacles. Every day, before the train came through, he would walk the length of the tunnel. If all was well, he would return to his hut and take a nap. If something was wrong, he would walk back up the line and wave a red flag, and the engine driver would slow down. At night, the watchman lit an oil lamp and made a similar inspection of the tunnel. Of course, he would not stop the train if there was a porcupine on the line. But if there was any danger to the train, he’d go back up the line and wave his lamp to the approaching engine. If all was well, he’d hang his lamp at the door of his hut and go to sleep. He was just settling down on his cot for an afternoon nap when he saw the boy emerge from the tunnel.

He moved off towards the tunnel, while Suraj sat on the cot, sipping his tea. In the dark, the trees seemed to move closer to him. And the nightlife of the forest was conveyed on the breeze—the sharp call of a barking deer, the cry of a fox, the quaint tonk-tonk of a nightjar. There were some sounds that Suraj didn’t recognise—sounds that came from the trees, creakings and whisperings, as though the trees were coming to life, stretching their limbs in the dark, shifting a little, flexing their fingers. Sunder Singh stood inside the tunnel, trimming his lamp. The night sounds were familiar to him and he did not give them much thought; but something else—a padded footfall, a rustle of dry leaves—made him stand still for a few seconds, peering into the darkness. Then, humming softly to himself, he returned to where Suraj was waiting. Ten minutes remained for the night mail to arrive. As Sunder Singh sat down on the cot beside Suraj, a new sound reached both of them quite distinctly—a rhythmic sawing sound, as if someone cutting through the branch of a tree. “What’s that?” whispered Suraj. “It’s the leopard,” said Sunder Singh. “I think it’s in the tunnel.” “The train will soon be here,” said Suraj. “Yes, my friend. And if we don’t drive the leopard out of the tunnel, it will be run over and killed.

Baring its teeth and snarling, it went down on its belly, tail twitching. Suraj and Sunder Singh both shouted together. Their voices rang through the tunnel. And the leopard, uncertain as to how many terrifying humans were there in the tunnel with him, turned swiftly and disappeared into the darkness. To make sure that it had gone, Sunder Singh and Suraj walked the length of the tunnel. When they returned to the entrance, the rails were beginning to hum. They knew the train was coming.

Only the rails still trembled with the passing of the train. They trembled again to the passing of the same train, almost a week later, when Suraj and his father were both travelling in it. Suraj’s father was scribbling in a notebook, doing his accounts. Suraj sat at an open window staring out at the darkness. His father was going to Delhi on a business trip and had decided to take the boy along. (“I don’t know where he gets to, most of the time,” he’d complained. “I think it’s time he learnt something about my business.”) The night mail rushed through the forest with its hundreds of passengers. The carriage wheels beat out a steady rhythm on the rails. Tiny flickering lights came and went, as they passed small villages on the fringe of the jungle. Suraj heard the rumble as the train passed over a small bridge. It was too dark to see the hut near the cutting, but he knew they must be approaching the tunnel. He strained his eyes looking out into the night; and then, just as the engine let out a shrill whistle, Suraj saw the lamp. He couldn’t see Sunder Singh, but he saw the lamp, and he knew that his friend was out there. The train went into the tunnel and out again; it left the jungle behind and thundered across the endless plains.

Let us speak When speaking in English, small differences in pronunciation can change the overall meaning of the words. One such difference is in the pronunciation of the consonant ‘c’. For example: cat (uses /k/ sound for ‘c’) and city (uses the /s/ sound for ‘c’) The poem uses the word ‘cinders’, which is pronounced with a /s/ sound. The letter ‘c’ has two sounds. It can be pronounced as a /k/ or /s/ sound. But which is right depends on the next letters of the words. • Letter ‘c’ produces /s/ sound if it is followed by the letters ‘e’, ‘i’, or ‘y’. For example, city (‘c’ is followed by ‘i’). This /s/ sound is known as the soft ‘c’ sound. • Letter ‘c’ produces /k/ sound if it is followed by the letters ‘a’, ‘o’, or ‘u’ or a consonant at the end of the word. For example, cat (‘c’ is followed by ‘a’). This /k/ sound is known as the hard ‘c’ sound. That is why ‘cinders’ is pronounced with a /s/ sound. The letter ‘c’ is followed by ‘i’! Now, work in pairs.

Arunima Sinha’s journey from a devastating accident to scaling the highest peak in the world stands as a beacon of hope and resilience. In 2011, at the age of 24, Arunima Sinha, a national-level volleyball player, faced a life-altering event. It challenged her in ways she could never have imagined. As she lay in the hospital bed with one leg amputated, Arunima made a vow that many would deem impossible: not only to walk again with a prosthetic leg but to scale Mount Everest. In 2013, she did just that, becoming the first Indian female amputee to achieve this feat. Hence, in 2015, she was awarded the Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award in India.

Arunima hails from Ambedkar Nagar, a small district in Uttar Pradesh. Her father was an army engineer, and her mother worked as a health supervisor. Sports were a significant part of Arunima’s life, with her family having a natural inclination towards athletics. After completing her law degree following her post-graduation, Arunima decided to pursue a job in the paramilitary forces, which would allow her to continue her passion for sports while having a regular income. On the fateful night of 11 April 2011, she met with a train accident. The hours that followed were harrowing. She never imagined she would survive that night, but survive she did, miraculously, displaying an extraordinary will to live. Arunima received a prosthetic leg and underwent physiotherapy. It was during this period that she made a profound decision. Inspired by an article about Mount Everest, she resolved to conquer the highest peak in the world. To pursue her ambition, Arunima Sinha completed a basic mountaineering course at the Nehru Institute of Mountaineering in Uttarkashi, followed by eighteen months of rigorous training.

The memorial symbolises the patriotism of Indian soldiers. Which is this memorial? I House No… Jayanagar Bengaluru 14 April 20XX Dear Ananda, Hope you are all doing well! Do you remember our last conversation about war and the importance of peace? We talked about how India had to struggle for its Independence from the British for many centuries. Post-independence our country has had to fight several wars to protect its borders, territorial integrity, and its people. This made me wonder, who were these brave Indian people? They fought to protect our country and sacrificed their lives so that we could lead our lives in peace. What were their names? Where did they come from? Does anyone remember anything about them? Last week I got the answers to some of my questions during an educational trip to New Delhi organised by our school. You may recall, I was looking forward to this trip and our visit to many places of historical and educational significance. I learnt several new and interesting things, and I am excited to share them with you. Let me begin by asking you to guess the name of the monument that I found most inspiring. Let’s see if you can guess. The construction of this monument started in April 2018 and was completed in February 2019. It was envisioned and then inaugurated by India’s Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi territorial integrity: safeguarding nation’s borders envisioned: visualised"}

But more importantly, it is a tribute to some of the bravest Indians. I’m sure you’ve guessed! It’s the ‘National War Memorial’. Won’t you say, a long-desired aspiration was fulfilled? Our visit to the National War Memorial began with our teacher explaining that even after Independence, India has had to fight many wars to protect herself, and the freedom and security we enjoy today is because of the many brave men and women who have served in the Indian Armed Forces over decades. Sadly, she said, war always takes its toll, and therefore, many brave soldiers have had to sacrifice their lives for the country even after our Independence in 1947. This is what makes monuments like the National War Memorial extremely important, so that we should never forget the cost of freedom. We are aware, always, of the pain and horrors of war. We learnt that each brick of the memorial is called a tablet, and it bears the names of soldiers who fought for India and made the supreme sacrifice in different wars from 1947 till date, including the Indo-China conflict of 1962, the Indo- Pak Wars in 1965 & 1971 and the Kargil War in 1999. There are 29,000 tablets on which more than 26,000 names of fallen soldiers have been etched. It was heartening to know that our government has recognised the sacrifice of brave soldiers. Our teacher told us about the 21 bravehearts who were awarded the Param Vir Chakra (PVC), India’s highest wartime gallantry medal, for their service to the nation. She also told us about Maha Vir Chakra (MVC), Kirti Chakra (KC), Vir Chakra (VrC), and Shaurya Chakra (SC). Major Somnath Sharma was posthumously awarded India’s first PVC in the Battle of Badgam in 1947. Later some more PVCs were awarded for exceptional gallantry during the India- China Conflict of 1962, and the India-Pakistan War of 1965. Besides, a PVC was also awarded for service during the UN Peace Keeping Operations in Congo. In the 1971 war, some of the heroes who were awarded the PVC (posthumously) include Lance Naik Albert Ekka, Flying Officer Nirmal Jit Singh Sekhon, Second Lieutenant Arun Khetarpal, and Major Hoshiar Singh.

The assaulting troops were subjected to intense shelling and heavy small arms fire, but they charged on to the objective and were locked in bitter hand-to-hand combat. Lance Naik Albert Ekka noticed an enemy Light Machine Gun inflicting heavy casualties on his company.

In this process, however, he received serious injuries and succumbed to them after the capture of the objective. In this action, Lance Naik Albert Ekka displayed the most conspicuous valour, determination and made the supreme sacrifice in the best traditions of the Army. (Gazette of India Notification No. 7– Pres./72) As we continued our visit around the National War Memorial, we came across another important installation called Amar Jawan Jyoti that commemorates our soldiers. The name, as you may have guessed, represents an immortal flame that is kept ablaze all through the day and night to revere the sacrifices of our soldiers. Earlier the Amar Jawan Jyoti, which also displayed a rifle and a helmet, was alighted under the arch of India Gate in January 1972 to commemorate India’s victory in the India-Pakistan War of 1971. commemorates: remember officially and show respect obelisk: tapering stone pillar wreaths: circular arrangement of flowers used as a respect and remembrance for a person who has died interminable: everlasting The National War Memorial now includes Amar Jawan Jyoti in the obelisk, which is surrounded by four Chakras.

Here is a picture of the new Amar Jawan Jyoti if you haven’t seen it. You can see the obelisk surrounded by wreaths that have been placed as a mark of respect. The lighting design is planned in such a way that it transforms the monument’s landscape as sunlight changes from dawn to dusk. It truly is a majestic site that filled me with pride for our nation.

The National War Memorial consists of four concentric circles, which are known as Amar Chakra, Veerta Chakra, Tyag Chakra, and Raksha Chakra around a 15-metre-tall central obelisk with the eternal flame—the Amar Jawan Jyoti. It also houses bronze and stone murals and graphic panels. Isn’t it amazing! The innermost circle represents the Amar Chakra, also known as the ‘Circle of Immortality’. This has the Obelisk with Eternal Flame. The Amar Jawan Jyoti flame symbolises the immortality of the spirit of fallen soldiers with the assurance that the nation will never forget their sacrifice. The second circle is called the Veerta Chakra, which is also known as the ‘Circle of Bravery’. There is a covered gallery that exhibits six murals crafted in bronze, depicting valiant battle actions of our Armed Forces.

Success of the battalion and brigade operation hinged on the early capture of this position. However, the company attack almost faltered at the very beginning when the enemy’s artillery fire came down squarely on the leading platoon, inflicting large number of casualties. With utter disregard to his personal safety, Major Padmapani Acharya took the reserve platoon of his company and led it through raining artillery shells. Even as his men were falling to the murderous enemy fire, he continued to encourage his men and charged at the enemy up the steep rock face with his reserve platoon. Unmindful of the hail of bullets from the enemy’s position, Major Padmapani Acharya crawled up to the enemy position and lobbed grenades. In this daring assault, Major Acharya was severely injured. Despite being seriously injured and unable to move, he ordered his men to leave him and charge at the enemy while he continued to fire at the enemy. The enemy position was finally over-run and the objective was captured. After completion of the mission, the officer however, succumbed to his injuries.

In my view, it is also an expression of deep gratitude for the supreme sacrifice made by our brave soldiers defending the sovereignty and integrity of the country. I feel motivated and I am seriously thinking of joining the Armed Forces to serve my motherland. I also feel it is our duty to periodically visit such places to honour our valiant soldiers, who have made great sacrifices for us. Their sacrifices enable us to walk freely in our country without fear of enemy threats. It is nice of your teacher and school to arrange this visit to give you all a chance to learn about India’s heroes and also pay your respect to them.

As we approached the garden, we saw people offering flowers and prayers. We joined the group out of curiosity and quickly realised that they were all there to pay respect to the soldiers at the War Memorial located in the heart of the garden. When I think back about my visit where everyone was dedicating flowers as a mark of respect to our soldiers, I was reminded of the following poem: Pushp ki Abhilasha Chaah Nahi, Main Sur Bala Ke Gehanon Mein Goontha Jaaun, Chaah Nahi, Premi-Mala Mein Bandh Pyaari Ko Lalchaaun!

Today, I, Gunjan, of Grade 7-C, stand before you to share why I dream of joining the Indian Armed Forces when I grow up. Serving our country is the most honourable job one can have. It means protecting and securing our nation, even if it means risking one’s life. The thought of wearing the uniform, which can only be earned through hard work, fills me with pride and a strong desire to serve India. The Armed Forces teach you to live a disciplined and organised life. This keeps both the mind and body active. Soldiers are always ready to face challenges because of this discipline. Additionally, regular exercise and training keep soldiers physically fit and ready for any situation. This preparation is something I greatly admire and wish to achieve. Lastly, being a soldier means having new experiences and adventures everyday. Each day brings new challenges, teaching important lessons, and helping one grow. The Armed Forces offer a life filled with honour, self-respect, safety, and security for both the soldier and their families. It is a life that teaches loyalty, duty, service, and honesty. This is why I want to join the Indian Armed Forces. Thank you. 223 Bravehearts"}

Hello children, you all have read about Rani Abbakka. Let me share with you some details about one more braveheart. Her name is Rani Gaidinliu. Gaidinliu was born on 26 January 1915, in the present-day Tamenglong district of Manipur. She was a Naga leader who led an armed uprising against the British in Manipur, Nagaland, and Assam. Gaidinliu belonged to the Rongmei tribe, also known as the Kabui tribe. 224 Poorvi"}
{"id": "class 7__english__p239__c1", "text": "In 1927, at the age of 13, Gaidinliu joined the Heraka movement. This movement aimed at the revival of the Naga tribal religion and the establishment of self-rule for the Nagas, ending British rule. Gaidinliu was arrested in 1932 when she was just 16 and was sentenced to life imprisonment by the British rulers. Between 1932 and 1947, she was kept in several prisons across the Northeast. After being released in 1947, she continued to work for the betterment of her community. The then Prime Minister described Gaidinliu as the ‘Daughter of the Hills’ and gave her the title ‘Rani’ for her courage. She was also awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1982. In 1991, Rani Gaidinliu returned to her birthplace, where she died on 17 February 1993 at the age of 78. Rani Gaidinliu was conferred the Birsa Munda Award posthumously. The State Government has developed a park along with a statue to honour Rani Gaidinliu in Silchar, Assam. Not only that, the Government of India issued a postal stamp in her honour in 1996 and a commemorative coin in 2015. What a braveheart indeed! https://amritmahotsav.nic.in/unsung-heroes-detail.htm?56 Bravehearts 225"}

{"id": "class 7__maths__p3__c1", "text": "FOREWORD The National Education Policy 2020 envisages a system of education in the country that is rooted in an Indian ethos and its civilisational accomplishments in all fields of knowledge and human endeavour. At the same time, it aims to prepare students to engage constructively with the opportunities and challenges of the 21st century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. By nurturing students’ inherent abilities across all five planes of human existence (pañchakośhas), the Foundational and Preparatory Stages set the stage for further learning at Middle Stage. Spanning Grades 6 to 8, the Middle Stage serves as a critical three-year bridge between the Preparatory and Secondary Stages. The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages — including at least two languages native to India — to Science, Mathematics, Social Science, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas, as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy — a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. Ganita Prakash, the textbook of Mathematics for Grade 7, Part I, aligns with the expectations of NEP 2020 and NCF-SE 2023, with respect to creating a spark for initiating mathematical thinking. This textbook designed for Grade 7 students, takes forward its journey through the world of mathematics that started in Grade 6. During this journey the concepts and problems emerge from daily life situations and so it is expected that students will be able to relate to them with ease. The book makes efforts to encourage the students to observe and explore the patterns around them and discover mathematical concepts on their own. The content attempts to integrate mathematics with other subject areas such as science, social science with cross-cutting themes like environmental education, value education, inclusive education, and Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS). Colourful illustrations and interactive exercises form the basis of this textbook that would develop a strong foundation among children in understanding more complex mathematical"}

Throughout the book, stories, conversations and anecdotes have been incorporated to make abstract mathematical concepts more relatable and accessible to young learners. Puzzles and innovative problems will not only engage the students in thoughtfully relating the mathematical concepts to the world around them and help them in deepening their understanding of mathematics, but also prepare them to understand the concepts of the emerging field of computational thinking. The focus is on collaboration and active engagement through student-centered approach to education. However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years.

{"id": "class 7__maths__p5__c1", "text": "ABOUT THE BOOK Mathematics helps students develop not only basic arithmetic skills, but also the crucial capacities of logical reasoning, creative problem solving, and clear and precise communication (both oral and written). Mathematical knowledge also plays a crucial role in understanding concepts in other school subjects, such as Science and Social Science, and even Arts, Physical Education, and Vocational Education. Learning Mathematics can also contribute to the development of capacities for making informed choices and decisions. Understanding numbers and quantitative arguments is necessary for effective and meaningful democratic and economic participation. Mathematics thus has an important role to play in achieving the overall aims of school education. Mathematics at the Middle Stage is a major challenge and has to perform the dual role of being both close to the experience and environment of the child and being abstract. It must perform the dual role of developing intuition while also maintaining and emphasising rigour. It must perform the dual role of enhancing critical and logical thinking while also developing artistry and creativity and a sense of elegance and aesthetics. Finally, Mathematics must perform the dual role of providing students plenty of opportunities for exploration and discovery of concepts on their own while also teaching best- known methods in the global repertoire of mathematics. The present textbook has made an attempt to address the above mentioned goals and challenges of learning mathematics. The writers of this book have aimed to strike a judicious balance between informal and formal definitions and methods to develop in students both intuition and rigour. The book also provides numerous opportunities for student-student and student–teacher interaction in the classroom to promote active and experiential learning. A number of questions, puzzles, and interactive exercises are posed throughout the book to encourage constant exploration. Many of the questions are open- ended to stimulate in-class discussion. The first chapter of this book, ‘Large Numbers Around Us’, is an introduction to the world of lakhs and crores, and millions and billions through engaging explorations and contexts. Chapter 2, ‘Arithmetic Expressions’, considers expressions having multiple operations and discusses how they can be written and read without ambiguity. Chapter 3, ‘A Peek Beyond the Point’, introduces the usage of the decimal point and additions and subtractions involving decimal numbers. Chapter 4, ‘Expressions using Letter-Numbers’ builds on the chapter on Arithmetic Expressions to guide students to take the first steps into the world of algebra. The fundamental notions of letter-numbers and algebraic expressions are introduced. Chapter 5, ‘Parallel and Intersecting Lines’, introduces some fundamental building blocks of geometry and has a balance of engaging activities like paper folding and rigorous mathematical reasoning. Chapter 6, ‘Number Play’, covers aspects of computational thinking and problem solving through puzzles and concepts of parity, the Virahāṅka-Fibonacci sequence, and cryptarithms. Chapter 7, ‘A Tale of Three Intersecting Lines’,"}
{"id": "class 7__maths__p6__c1", "text": "vi explores, through construction, some of the striking properties of a triangle related to the lengths of their sides and angles. Chapter 8, ‘Working with Fractions’, builds on the students’ understanding of fractions, and explores the multiplication and division of fractions. The methods and formulas of the great Indian mathematician Brahmagupta (628 CE) for performing these operations on fractions is brought alive with fresh examples and interesting puzzles. In all chapters, an attempt has been made to emphasise connections with other subjects including Art, History, and Science. By weaving together storytelling and hands-on activities, we hope that an immersive learning experience will be created that ignites curiosity and fosters a love for mathematics. It is hoped that teachers would give children the opportunity to discuss, play, engage with each other, provide logical arguments for different ideas, and find loopholes in arguments presented. This is necessary for the learners to eventually develop the ability to understand what it means to prove something and also become confident about underlying concepts. The mathematics classroom should not expect a blind application of algorithms but should rather encourage children to find many different ways to solve problems. As per the NEP 2020, computational thinking has also been gently introduced through puzzles, games, and interactive exercises that encourage such thinking. Indian rootedness has also been kept in mind while giving contexts for different concepts. The contributions of Indian mathematicians have been given as part of a problem-solving approach to make students aware of India’s rich mathematical heritage and its global contributions to mathematics. The concepts and problems are related to daily life situations. An attempt has been made to use contexts and materials with which the students are familiar. Learning material sheets have been given at the back of the book that may be photocopied and used. At many places, exercises or activities are given to encourage peer group efforts and discussions. The textbook intends to address the learning needs of a diverse group of students in the classroom. We have tried to link concepts learnt in initial chapters with ideas in subsequent chapters to show the connectedness and unity of mathematics. We hope that teachers will use this as an opportunity to revise these concepts in a spiralling way so that children are able to appreciate the entire conceptual structure of mathematics. We hope that teachers may give more time to the ideas of fractions, negative numbers and other notions that are new to students. Many of these are the basis for further learning in mathematics. Finally, this book aims to be more than just a textbook—it’s a passport to a world of mathematical discovery and exploration. Whether used in the classroom or at home, we hope that it may inspire students to embark on their own mathematical adventures, empowering them to see the beauty and relevance of mathematics in everything around them. With its engaging approach and comprehensive coverage of Grade 7 mathematics concepts, this book hopes and aims to captivate young minds and set them on a lifelong journey of mathematical discovery."}

{"id": "class 7__maths__p11__c1", "text": "NOTE TO THE TEACHER We hope that this book, Ganita Prakash, will serve as a strong support and guide to you in achieving the exciting task that you have before you: that of passing on the joy of learning the beautiful subject of Mathematics to the next generation. This task calls for providing a fertile environment that allows for the flowering of mathematical thinking in the minds of students. Classrooms, where students just listen and write down whatever is being told to them or written on the board, are deficient in the conditions required for learning mathematics. Instead, classrooms need to be places where students are engaged in playing with mathematical concepts, finding and discussing patterns, and developing creative strategies together to solve problems. Students should also be posing problems to each other and discussing possible solutions with each other. In fact, these are the very conditions that have led to the development of the entire field of mathematics so far, and so one cannot expect students to pick up mathematical thinking and understanding without these conditions. Fortunately, it is not difficult to create such conditions in the classroom. It just requires an interesting question, problem, pattern, or challenge to be thrown open to the students on a regular basis, and sufficient time to be given to them to play with, discuss, and work on it as a class or in pairs or groups. Along with it, an environment that accepts mistakes and acknowledges their importance in learning needs to be nurtured. While creating the spark for initiating mathematical thinking in classrooms is not difficult, sustaining it may be challenging and may involve efforts from your side. Nevertheless, even if just the first part of throwing open a question, problem, pattern, or challenge is done at least once or twice a week, accompanied by sufficient waiting time from your side for students to play, discuss, and work on it, it can have a great positive impact on how the students view and approach mathematics. It should be noted that this positive impact will not happen overnight. That takes time and depends on various factors such as the number of opportunities you give for problem solving, your patience, and the encouragement you give to the students. To support you in posing problems, all the problems or questions in this book are marked using the icon . This icon is an indicator of a potential opportunity to start off a process of problem solving and exploration in the classroom. You will find some of the problems labelled “Math Talk”. Such questions can especially be made as topics for classroom discussion. An owl mascot appears at various points in the textbook to highlight important mathematical processes, ways of thinking, and problem-solving approaches. These can be brought out during classroom discussions, both where the owl is present and also in other similar situations."}
{"id": "class 7__maths__p12__c1", "text": "xii To develop students’ mathematical thinking and understanding of concepts, a sufficient number of problems are given. Trying to “cover” all of them must not happen at the cost of students not getting to spend quality time on playing with and discussing them. It is important to understand that the exploratory problems are not only for promoting problem solving skills; they also serve in strengthening procedural fluency when children start engaging in exploration. Efforts must be made in making students independent learners. One essential aspect required for this is an ability to read and understand mathematical text. To promote this skill, students should be encouraged to read the book by themselves and in groups. Give opportunities to them to interpret what they read and express it to others. This will also address the big problem that students face in speaking mathematics and interpreting word problems. This book contains a number of open-ended problems. It also contains new treatments of certain concepts. If you are not able to solve them or follow some of them immediately, it is perfectly okay! Not everyone knows everything. Along with trying to understand and reflect upon such content, it will be very useful to take it to the classroom and open it up for discussion. After the discussion, things that are clear and those that are not yet clear can be clearly summarised. This process itself can throw a lot of light on the content. In these discussions, you can participate as a fellow seeker, and when students see a teacher seek and think to understand something, it sets a wonderful example for them. It is hoped that you and your students will have a great and fruitful time using this book! Summary of Key Points Time for Exploration 1. It is important to routinely pose new problems, questions, patterns, or challenges to the students and give them sufficient time to play with, discuss, and work on them, individually and in groups. 2. During this time, an environment that accepts mistakes and acknowledges their importance in learning needs to be nurtured. 3. There should be a culture where students pose problems to each other and discuss with each other various ways to approach the problems. About the Problems in the Book 1.

Farmers used to preserve different varieties of seeds and use them to grow rice. Now, we only have a handful of varieties. Also, farmers have to come to the market to buy seeds”.

In the American system, the digits are grouped uniformly in a 3-3-3-3… pattern from right to left (thousands, millions, billions, etc.). The Indian system of naming numbers is also followed in Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Maldives, Afghanistan, and Myanmar. The words lakh and crore originate from the Sanskrit words lakṣha (लक्ष) and koṭi (कोटि‍). The American system is also used in many countries. Observe the number of zeroes in 1 lakh and 1 crore. 1 lakh, written in numbers would be 1 followed by 5 zeroes. 1 crore, written in numbers would be 1 followed by 7 zeroes. A lakh is a hundred times a thousand, a crore is a hundred times a lakh and an arab is a hundred times a crore (i.e., a hundred thousand is 1 lakh, 100 lakhs is 1 crore, and 100 crores is 1 arab).

There are situations where it is better to round down (rounding down is when the approximated number is less than the actual number).

Example 1: Mallika spends ₹25 every day for lunch at school. Write the expression for the total amount she spends on lunch in a week from Monday to Friday. The expression for the total amount is 5 × 25. 5 × 25 is “5 times 25” or “the product of 5 and 25”. Different expressions can have the same value. Here are multiple ways to express the number 12, using two numbers and any of the four operations +, – , × and ÷: 10 + 2, 15 – 3, 3 × 4, 24 ÷ 2. Choose your favourite number and write as many expressions as you can having that value. Comparing Expressions As we compare numbers using ‘=’, ‘<’ and ‘>’ signs, we can also compare expressions. We compare expressions based on their values and write the ‘equal to’, ‘greater than’ or ‘less than’ sign accordingly. For example, 10 + 2 > 7 + 1 ARITHMETIC EXPRESSIONS 2"}

Now he has 1022 + 128 marbles. Who has more? This situation can be represented as shown in the picture on the right. To begin with, Raja had 1 more marble than Joy.

In such cases, we need some tools and rules to specify how exactly the expression has to be evaluated. To give an example with language, look at the following sentences: (a) Sentence: “Shalini sat next to a friend with toys”. \u0007Meaning: The friend has toys and Shalini sat next to her. (b) \u0007Sentence: “Shalini sat next to a friend, with toys”. Meaning: Shalini has the toys and she sat with them next to her friend. This sentence without the punctuation could have been interpreted in two different ways. The appropriate use of a comma specifies how the sentence has to be understood. Let us see an expression that can be evaluated in more than one way. Example 4: Mallesh brought 30 marbles to the playground. Arun brought 5 bags of marbles with 4 marbles in each bag. How many marbles did Mallesh and Arun bring to the playground? Mallesh summarized this by writing the mathematical expression — 30 + 5 × 4."}
{"id": "class 7__maths__p45__c1", "text": "Arithmetic Expressions 27 Without knowing the context behind this expression, Purna found the value of this expression to be 140. He added 30 and 5 first, to get 35, and then multiplied 35 by 4 to get 140. Mallesh found the value of this expression to be 50. He multiplied 5 and 4 first to get 20 and added 20 to 30 to get 50. In this case, Mallesh is right. But why did Purna get it wrong? Just looking at the expression 30 + 5 × 4, it is not clear whether we should do the addition first or multiplication. Just as punctuation marks are used to resolve confusions in language, brackets and the notion of terms are used in mathematics to resolve confusions in evaluating expressions. Brackets in Expressions In the expression to find the number of marbles — 30 + 5 × 4 — we had to first multiply 5 and 4, and then add this product to 30. This order of operations is clarified by the use of brackets as follows: 30 + (5 × 4). When evaluating an expression having brackets, we need to first find the values of the expressions inside the brackets before performing other operations. So, in the above expression, we first find the value of 5 × 4, and then do the addition. Thus, this expression describes the number of marbles: 30 + (5 × 4 ) = 30 + 20 = 50. Example 5: Irfan bought a pack of biscuits for ₹15 and a packet of toor dal for ₹56. He gave the shopkeeper ₹100. Write an expression that can help us calculate the change Irfan will get back from the shopkeeper. Irfan spent ₹15 on a biscuit packet and ₹56 on toor dal. So, the total cost in rupees is 15 + 56. He gave ₹100 to the shopkeeper. So, he should get back 100 minus the total cost. Can we write that expression as— 100 – 15 + 56 ? Can we first subtract 15 from 100 and then add 56 to the result? We will get 141. It is absurd that he gets more money than he paid the shopkeeper! We can use brackets in this case: 100 – (15 + 56). Evaluating the expression within the brackets first, we get 100 minus 71, which is 29. So, Irfan will get back ₹29."}
{"id": "class 7__maths__p46__c1", "text": "Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 28 Terms in Expressions Suppose we have the expression 30 + 5 × 4 without any brackets. Does it have no meaning? When there are expressions having multiple operations, and the order of operations is not specified by the brackets, we use the notion of terms to determine the order. Terms are the parts of an expression separated by a ‘+’ sign. For example, in 12+7, the terms are 12 and 7, as marked below. 12 7 + 12 + 7 = We will keep marking each term of an expression as above. Note that this way of marking the terms is not a usual practice. This will be done until you become familiar with this concept. Now, what are the terms in 83 – 14? We know that subtracting a number is the same as adding the inverse of the number. Recall that the inverse of a given number has the sign opposite to it. For example, the inverse of 14 is –14, and the inverse of –14 is 14. Thus, subtracting 14 from 83 is the same as adding –14 to 83. That is, 83 – 14 + 83 – 14 = Thus, the terms of the expression 83 – 14 are 83 and –14. Check if replacing subtraction by addition in this way does not change the value of the expression, by taking different examples. Can you explain why subtracting a number is the same as adding its inverse, using the Token Model of integers that we saw in the Class 6 textbook of mathematics? All subtractions in an expression are converted to additions in this manner to identify the terms. Here are some more examples of expressions and their terms: – 18 – 3 + –18 – 3 = 6 × 5 3 + 6 × 5 + 3 = 2 – 10 + 2 – 10 + 4 × 6 = 4 × 6 + Note that 6 × 5, 4 × 6 are single terms as they do not have any ‘+’ sign. In the following table, some expressions are given. Complete the table. Try This"}

We will start with expressions having only additions (with all the subtractions suitably converted into additions). Does changing the order in which the terms are added give different values? Swapping and Grouping Let us consider a simple expression having only two terms. Example 6: Madhu is flying a drone from a terrace. The drone goes 6 m up and then 4 m down. Write an expression to show how high the final position of the drone is from the terrace. The drone is 6 – 4 = 2 m above the terrace. Writing it as sum of terms: 6 – 4 + 2 = Will the sum change if we swap the terms? – 4 6 + 2 = It doesn’t in this case.

Let us add these terms in the following two different orders: – 7 10 + – 11 + (adding the first two terms and then adding their sum to the third term) – 7 10 + – 11 + (adding the last two terms and then adding their sum to the first term) What do you see? The sums are the same in both cases. Again, we know that while adding positive numbers, grouping them in any of the above two ways gives the same sum.

What happens when we change the order and add –7 and –11 first, and then add this sum to 10? Will we get the same sum as before?

Consider expressions with more than 3 terms also. Can you explain why this is happening using the Token Model of integers that we saw in the Class 6 textbook of mathematics? Thus, the addition of terms in any order gives the same value. Therefore, in an expression having only additions, it does not matter in what order the terms are added: they all give the same value. Now let us consider expressions having multiplication and division also, without the order of operations specified by the brackets. The values of such expressions are found by first evaluating the terms. Once all the terms are evaluated, they are added. For example, the expression 30 + 5 × 4 is evaluated as follows: 30 30 5 × 4 20 + + 30 + 5 × 4 = 50 = = The expression 5 × (3 + 2) + 78 + 3 is evaluated as follows: 5 × (3 + 2) 3 + 5 × (3 + 2) + 78 + 3 = + 7 × 8 Where (3+2) is first evaluated and this sum is multiplied by 5 (= 25). The expression 7 × 8 is evaluated (= 56). This simplifies to 25 + 56 + 3 = 84. Manasa is adding a long list of numbers. It took her five minutes to add them all and she got the answer 11749.

Removing Brackets — I Let us find the value of this expression, 200 – (40 + 3). We first evaluate the expression inside the bracket to 43 and then subtract it from 200. But it is simpler to first subtract 40 from 200: 200 – 40 = 160. And then subtract 3 from 160: 160 – 3 = 157. What we did here was 200 – 40 – 3. Notice, that we did not do 200 – 40 + 3.

(b) So, to find the change, we need to subtract the cost of toor dal from 85. 85 – 56 = 29. What we have done here is 100 – 15 – 56. So, 100 – (15 + 56) = 100 – 15 – 56.

Example 13: Consider the expression 500 – (250 – 100). Is it possible to write this expression without the brackets? To evaluate this expression, we need to subtract 250 – 100 = 150 from 500: 500 – (250 – 100) = 500 – 150 = 350. If we were to directly subtract 250 from 500, then we would have subtracted 100 more than what we needed to. So, we should add back that 100 to 500 – 250 to make the expression take the same value as 500 – (250 – 100). This sequence of operations is 500 – 250+100. Thus, 500 – (250 – 100) = 500 – 250 + 100. Check that 500 – (250 – 100) is not equal to 500 – 250 – 100. Notice again that when the brackets preceded by a negative sign are removed, the signs of the terms inside the brackets change. In this case, the signs of 250 and – 100 change to – 250 and 100. Example 14: Hira has a rare coin collection. She has 28 coins in one bag and 35 coins in another. She gifts her friend 10 coins from the second bag. Write an expression for the number of coins left with Hira. This can be expressed by 28 + (35 – 10). We know that this is the same as 28 + (35 + (–10)). Since the terms can be added in any order, this expression can simply be written as 28 + 35 + (–10), or 28 + 35 – 10. Thus, 28 + (35 – 10) = 28 + 35 – 10 = 53. When the brackets are NOT preceded by a negative sign, the terms within them do not change their signs upon removing the brackets.

This can also be found by first finding the total number of rows, i.e., 4 + 3, and then multiplying their sum by the number of children in each row. Thus, the number of boys and girls can be found by (4 + 3) × 5. Therefore, 4 × 5 + 3 × 5 = (4 + 3) × 5. Computing these expressions, we get 4 × 5 20 3 × 5 15 + + 4 × 5 + 3 × 5 = 35 = = 2 × 43 + 2 × 24 2 × (43 + 24) ₹ 43 ₹ 43 ₹ 24 ₹ 24 3 × 5 (4+3) × 5 4 × 5"}

The observations that we have made in the previous two examples can be seen in a general way as follows. Consider 10 × 98 + 3 × 98. This means taking the sum of 10 times 98 and 3 times 98. 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 10 times 3 times Clearly, this is the same as 10 + 3 = 13 times 98. Thus, 10 × 98 +3 × 98 = (10 + 3) × 98. Writing this equality the other way, we get (10 + 3) 98 = 10 × 98 + 3 × 98. Swapping the numbers in the products above, this property can be seen in the following form: 98 × 10 + 9 × 83 = 98 (10 + 3), and 98 (10 + 3) = 98 × 10 + 98 × 3. Similarly, let us consider the expression 14 × 10 – 6 × 10. This means subtracting 6 times 10 from 14 times 10. 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 14 times Clearly, this is 14 – 6 = 8 times 10. Thus, 14 × 10 – 6 × 10 = (14 – 6) × 10, or (14 – 6) × 10 = 14 × 10 – 6 × 10 This property can be nicely summed up as follows: The multiple of a sum (difference) is the same as the sum (difference) of the multiples.

Sonu was fascinated by how such a small difference in lengths could matter so much. He was curious to know the difference in lengths.

{"id": "class 7__maths__p77__c1", "text": "A Peek Beyond the Point Can we not split a unit into 4 equal parts, 5 equal parts, 8 equal parts, or any other number of equal parts instead? Yes, we can. The example below compares how the same length is represented when the unit is split into 10 equal parts and when the unit is split into 4 equal parts. If an even more precise measure is needed, each quarter can further be split into four equal parts. Each part then measures 1 16 of a unit, i.e., 16 such parts make 1 unit. Then why split a unit into 10 parts every time? The reason is the special role that 10 plays in the Indian place value system. For a whole number written in the Indian place value system — for example, 281 — the place value of 2 is hundreds (100), that of 8 is tens (10), and that of 4 is one (1). Each place value is 10 times bigger than the one immediately to its right. Equivalently, each place value is 10 times smaller than the one immediately to its left: 10 ones make 1 ten, 10 tens make 1 hundred, 10 hundreds make 1 thousand, and so on. 10,000 1000 100 10 1 × 10 ÷ 10 × 10 ÷ 10 × 10 ÷ 10 × 10 ÷ 10 In order to extend this system of writing numbers to quantities smaller than one, we divide one into 10 equal parts.

We shall learn about other ways of writing numbers in later grades. How Big? We already know that a hundred 10s make 1000, and a hundred 100s make 10000. We can ask similar questions about fractional parts: (a) How many thousandths make one unit? (b) How many thousandths make one tenth? (c) How many thousandths make one hundredth? (d) How many tenths make one ten? (e) How many hundredths make one ten? Make a few more questions of this kind and answer them. Notation, Writing and Reading of Numbers We have been writing numbers in a particular way, say 456, instead of writing them as 4 × 100 (4 hundreds) + 5 × 10 (5 tens) + 6 × 1 (6 ones).

Also, the sum will always be less than 2 more than the sum of their whole number parts.” Let us use an example to understand what his claim means: If the two numbers to be added are 25.936 and 8.202, the claim is that their sum will be greater than 25 + 8 (whole number parts) and will be less than 25 + 1 + 8 + 1. What do you think about this claim? Verify if this is true for these numbers. Will it work for any 2 decimal numbers? What about for the sum of 25.93603259 and 8.202?

(1 euro-cent = 1/100 euro). • In 1983, a decimal error nearly caused a disaster for an Air Canada Boeing 767. The ground staff miscalculated the fuel, loading 22,300 pounds instead of kilograms—about half of what was needed (1 pound ~ 0.453 kg). The plane ran out of fuel mid-air, forcing the pilots to make an emergency landing at an abandoned airfield. Fortunately, everyone survived. Several incidents have occurred due to incorrect reading of decimal numbers while giving medication. For example, reading 0.05 mg as 0.5 mg can lead to using a medicine 10 times more than the prescribed quantity. It is therefore important to pay attention to units and the location of the decimal point. Deceptive Decimal Notation Sarayu gets a message: “The bus will reach the station 4.5 hours post noon.” When will the bus reach the station: 4:05 p.m., 4:50 p.m., 4:25 p.m.? None of these! Here, 0.5 hours means splitting an hour into 10 equal parts and taking 5 parts out of it. Each part will be 6 minutes (60 minutes/10) long. 5 such parts make 30 minutes. So, the bus will reach the station at 4:30. Here is a short-story of a decimal mishap: A girl measures the width of an opening as 2 ft 5 inches but conveys to the carpenter to make a door 2.5 ft wide. The carpenter makes a door of width 2 ft 6 inches (since 1 ft = 12 inches, 0.5 ft = 6 inches), and it wouldn’t close fully. I said the door’s width should be 2.5 ft. It is 2.5 ft!

Where else can we see such ‘non-decimals’ with a decimal-like notation? A Pinch of History – Decimal Notation Over Time Decimal fractions (i.e., fractions with denominators like 1 10 , 1 100 , 1 1000 , and so on) are used in the works of a number of ancient Indian astronomers and mathematicians, including in the important 8th century works of Śhrīdharāchārya on arithmetic and algebra. Decimal notation, in essentially its modern form, was described in detail in Kitāb al-Fuṣūl fī al-Ḥisāb al Hindī (The Book of Chapters on Indian Arithmetic) by Abūl Ḥassan al-Uqlīdisī, an Arab mathematician, in around 950 CE. He represented the number 0.059375 as 0ˈ 059375. In the 15th century, to separate whole numbers from fractional parts, a number of different notations were used: • a vertical mark on the last digit of the whole number part (as shown above), • use of different colours and • a numerical superscript giving the number of fractional decimal places (0.36 would be written as 36 2 ). In the 16th century, John Napier, a Scottish mathematician, and Christopher Clavius, a German mathematician, used the point/period (‘.’) to separate the whole number and the fractional parts, while François Viète, a French mathematician, used the comma (‘,’) instead. Currently, several countries use the comma to separate the integer part and the fractional part. In these countries, the number 1,000.5 is written as 1 000,5 (space as a thousand separator). But the decimal point has endured as the most popular notation for writing numbers having fractional parts in the Indian place value system. Figure it Out 1.

{"id": "class 7__maths__p99__c1", "text": "4.1 The Notion of Letter-Numbers In this chapter we shall look at a concise way of expressing mathematical relations and patterns. We shall see how this helps us in thinking about these relationships and patterns, and in explaining why they may hold true. Example 1: Shabnam is 3 years older than Aftab. When Aftab’s age 10 years, Shabnam’s age will be 13 years. Now Aftab’s age is 18 years, what will Shabnam’s age be? _______ Given Aftab’s age, how will you find out Shabnam’s age? Easy: We add 3 to Aftab’s age to get Shabnam’s age. Can we write this as an expression? Shabnam’s age is 3 years more than Aftab’s. In short, this can be written as: Shabnam’s age = Aftab’s age + 3. Such mathematical relations are generally represented in a shorthand form. In the relation above, instead of writing the phrase ‘Aftab’s Age’, the convention is to use a convenient symbol. Usually, letters or short phrases are used for this purpose. Let us say we use the letter a to denote Aftab’s age (we could have used any other letter), and s to denote Shabnam’s age. Then the expression to find Shabnam’s age will be a + 3, which can be written as s = a + 3. If a is 23 (Aftab’s age in years), then what is Shabnam’s age? Expression for Shabnam’s age 4 + 3 10 + 3 23 + 3 ? + 3 a + 3 Aftab’s age 4 10 23 ? a Fig. 4.1 EXPRESSIONS USING LETTER- NUMBERS 4"}
{"id": "class 7__maths__p100__c1", "text": "Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 Replacing a by 23 in the expression a + 3, we get, s = 23 + 3 = 26 years. Letters such as a and s that are used to represent numbers are called letter-numbers. Mathematical expressions containing letter-numbers, such as the expression a + 3, are called algebraic expressions. Given the age of Shabnam, write an expression to find Aftab’s age. We know that Aftab is 3 years younger than Shabnam. So, Aftab’s age will be 3 less than Shabnam’s. This can be described as Aftab’s age = Shabnam’s age – 3. If we again use the letter a to denote Aftab’s age and the letter s to denote Shabnam’s age, then the algebraic expression would be: a = s – 3, meaning 3 less than s. Use this expression to find Aftab’s age if Shabnam’s age is 20. Example 2: Parthiv is making matchstick patterns. He repeatedly places Ls next to each other. Each L has two matchsticks as shown in Figure 4.2. Fig. 4.2 How many matchsticks are needed to make 5 Ls? It will be 5 × 2. How many matchsticks are needed to make 7 Ls? It will be 7 × 2. How many matchsticks are needed to make 45 Ls? It will be 45 × 2. \u0007Now, what is the relation between the number of Ls and the number of sticks? First, let us describe the relationship or the pattern here. Every L needs 2 matchsticks. So the number of matchsticks needed will be 2 times the number of L’s. This can be written as: Number of matchsticks = 2 × Number of L’s Now, we can use any letter to denote the number of L’s. Let’s use n. The algebraic expression for the number of matchsticks will be: 2 × n. This expression tells us how many matchsticks are needed to make n L’s. To find the number of matchsticks, we just replace n by the number of L. Example 3: Ketaki prepares and supplies coconut-jaggery laddus.

Write an algebraic expression to find the total amount to be paid for a given number of coconuts and quantity of jaggery. Let us identify the relationships and then write the expressions. Quantity needed Relationship Expression Cost of coconuts Number of coconuts × 35 c × 35 Cost of jaggery Number of kgs of jaggery × 60 j × 60 Here, ‘c’ represents the number of coconuts and ‘j’ represents the number of kgs of jaggery.

In a calendar month, if any 2 × 3 grid full of dates is chosen as shown in the picture, write expressions for the dates in the blank cells if the bottom middle cell has date ‘w’. 4.2 Revisiting Arithmetic Expressions We learnt to write expressions as sums of terms and it became easy for us to read arithmetic expressions. Many times they could have been read in multiple ways and it was confusing. We used swapping (adding two numbers in any order) and grouping (adding numbers by grouping them conveniently) to find easy ways of evaluating expressions. Swapping and grouping terms does not change the value of the expression. We also learnt to use brackets in expressions, including brackets with a negative sign outside. We learnt the distributive property (multiple of a sum is the same as sum of multiples). Let us revise these concepts and find the values of the following expressions: 1. 23 – 10 × 2 2. 83 + 28 – 13 + 32 3. 34 – 14 + 20 4. 42 + 15 – (8 – 7) 5. 68 – (18 + 13) 6. 7 × 4 + 9 × 6 7. 20 + 8 × (16 – 6) Let us evaluate the first expression, 23 – 10 × 2. First we shall write the terms of the expression. Notice that one of the terms is a number, while the other one has to be converted to a number before adding the two terms. 23 – 10 × 2 = 23 + –10 × 2 = 23 + –20 = 3 w – 1 w 85"}
{"id": "class 7__maths__p104__c1", "text": "Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 Let us now evaluate the second one. All the terms of this expression are numbers. If we notice the terms, we find that it will be easier to evaluate if we swap and group the terms. 83 + 28 – 13 + 32 = Let us now look at the fifth expression. It has brackets with a negative sign outside. This can be evaluated in two ways — by solving the bracket first (like the solution on the left side) or by removing the brackets appropriately (as on the right side). Now, find the values of the other arithmetic expressions. Algebraic expressions also take number values when the letter- numbers they contain are replaced by numbers. In Example 1, for finding Shabnam’s age when Aftab is 23 years old, we replaced the letter-number a in the expression a + 3 by 23, and it took the value 26. 4.3 \u0007Omission of the Multiplication Symbol in Algebraic Expressions Look at this number sequence: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, ... How can we describe this sequence or pattern? Easy: These are the numbers appearing in the multiplication table of 4 (multiples of 4 in an increasing order). What is the third term of this sequence? It is 4 × 3. What is the 29th term of this sequence? It is 4 × 29. Find an algebraic expression to get the nth term of this sequence. Note that here ‘n’ is a letter-number that denotes a position in the sequence. 83 28 –13 32 + + + 70 60 130 = + = 37 = 68 –(18 + 13) = + 68 –31 = + 68 –(18 + 13) = + 50 –13 37 = + = 68 –18 –13 = + + OR 86"}

As 5m stands for 5 × m, the value of the expression when m = 2 is 5 × 2 + 3 = 13. Mind the Mistake, Mend the Mistake Some simplifications are shown below where the letter-numbers are replaced by numbers and the value of the expression is obtained. 1. Observe each of them and identify if there is a mistake. 2. If you think there is a mistake, try to explain what might have gone wrong. 3. Then, correct it and give the value of the expression. 4.4 Simplification of Algebraic Expressions Earlier we found expressions to find perimeters of different regular figures in terms of their sides. Let us now find an expression to find the perimeter of a rectangle. 1 If a = – 4, then 10 – a = 6. 2 If d = 6, then 3d = 36. 3 If s = 7, then 3s – 2 = 15. 4 If r = 8, then 2r + 1 = 29. 5 If j = 5, then 2j = 10. 6 If m = –6, then 3 (m + 1) = 19. 7 If f = 3, g = 1 then 2f – 2g = 2. 8 If t = 4, b = 3 then 2t + b = 24. 9 If h = 5, n = 6 then h – (3 – n) = 4. 87"}
{"id": "class 7__maths__p106__c1", "text": "Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 As in the previous cases, we will first describe how to get the perimeter when the length and the breadth of the rectangle are known: Find the sum of length + breadth + length + breadth. Let us use the letter-numbers l and b in place of length and breadth respectively. Let p denote the perimeter of the rectangle. Then we have p = l + b + l + b As we know, these represent numbers, and so the terms of an expression can be added in any order. Hence the above expression can be written as: = l + l + b + b As l + l = 2 × l = 2l, and b + b = 2 × b = 2b, we have p = 2l + 2b. Notice that the initial expression (l + b + l + b) and the final expression (2l + 2b) that we got for the perimeter look different. However, they are equal since the expression was obtained from the initial one by applying the same rules and operations we do for numbers; they are equal in the sense that they both take the same values when letter- numbers are replaced by numbers. For example, if we assign l = 3, b = 4, we get l + b + l + b = 3 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 14, and 2l + 2b = 2 × 3 + 2 × 4 = 14. We call the expression 2l + 2b the simplified form of l + b + l + b. Let us see some more examples of simplification. Example 5: Here is a table showing the number of pencils and erasers sold in a shop. The price per pencil is c, and the price per eraser is d. Find the total money earned by the shopkeeper during these three days. Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 Pencils (Price ‘c’) 5 3 10 Erasers (Price ‘d’) 4 6 1 Let us first find the money earned by the sale of pencils. The money earned by selling pencils on Day 1 is 5c. Similarly, the money earned by selling pencils on Day 2 is _____, and Day 3 is ______. The total money earned by the sale of pencils is 5c + 3c + 10c. Can we simplify this expression further and reduce the number of terms? 88"}
{"id": "class 7__maths__p107__c1", "text": "Expressions Using Letter-Numbers The expression means 5 times c is added to 3 times c is added to 10 times c. So in total, the letter-number c is added (5 + 3 + 10) times. This is what we have seen as the distributive property of numbers. Thus, 5 × c + 3 × c + 10 × c = (5 + 3 + 10) × c (5 + 3 + 10) × c can be simplified to 18 × c = 18c. If c = ₹50, find the total amount earned by the scale of pencils. Write the expression for the total money earned by selling erasers. Then, simplify the expression. The expression for the total money earned by selling pencils and erasers during these three days is 18c + 11d. Can the expression 18c + 11d be simplified further? There is no way of further simplifying this expression as it contains different letter-numbers. It is in its simplest form. In this problem, we saw the expression 5c + 3c + 10c getting simplified to the expression 18c. Check that both expressions take the same value when c is replaced by different numbers. Example 6: A big rectangle is split into two smaller rectangles as shown. Write an expression describing the area of the bigger rectangle. The areas of the smaller rectangles are 4v sq. units and 3v sq. units. The area of the bigger rectangle can be found in two ways: (i) by directly using its side lengths v and (4 + 3), or (ii) by adding the areas of the smaller rectangles. The first way gives 7v, and the second way gives 4v + 3v. We know that they are equal: 4v + 3v = 7v, and this is the required expression for the area of the bigger rectangle. As earlier, a big rectangle is split into two smaller rectangles as shown below. Write an expression to find the area of the rectangle AEFD. Another way of seeing the distributive property. 3 4 v 89"}
{"id": "class 7__maths__p108__c1", "text": "Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 Even in this case, the area of rectangle AEFD can be found in two ways: (i) by directly using the side lengths n and (12 – 4), or (ii) subtracting the area of the rectangle EBCF from that of ABCD. The first method gives us 8n, and the second method gives us 12n – 4n, and they are equal, since 12n – 4n = 8n. This is the expression for the area of the rectangle AEFD. Sets of terms such as (5c, c, 10c), (12n, – 4n) that involve the same letter-numbers are called like terms. Sets of terms such as {18c, 11d} are called unlike terms as they have different letter-numbers. As we have seen, like terms can be added together and simplified into a single term.

When the furniture is returned, the shopkeeper pays back some amount as follows. Write an expression for the total number of rupees paid if x chairs and y tables are rented. For x chairs and y tables, let us find the total amount paid at the beginning and the amount one gets back after returning the furniture. Describe the procedure to get these amounts. The total amount in rupees paid at the beginning is 40x + 75y, and the total amount returned is 6x + 10y. So, the total amount paid = (40x + 75y) – (6x + 10y). Can we simplify this expression?

{"id": "class 7__maths__p109__c1", "text": "Expressions Using Letter-Numbers Recalling how we open brackets in an arithmetic expression, we get (40x + 75y) – (6x + 10y) = (40x + 75y) – 6x – 10y Since the terms can be added in any order, the remaining bracket can be opened and the expression becomes 40x + 75y + – 6x + – 10y We can group the like terms together, This results in 40x + – 6x + 75y + – 10y = (40 – 6)x + (75 – 10)y = 34x + 65y. The expression (40x + 75y) – (6x + 10y) is simplified to 34x + 65y, which is the total amount paid in rupees. Could we have written the initial expression as (40x + 75y) + (– 6x – 10y)? Example 8: Charu has been through three rounds of a quiz. Her scores in the three rounds are 7p – 3q, 8p – 4q, and 6p – 2q. Here, p represents the score for a correct answer and q represents the penalty for an incorrect answer. What do each of the expressions mean? If the score for a correct answer is 4 (p = 4) and the penalty for a wrong answer is 1 (q = 1), find Charu’s score in the first round. Charu’s score is 7 × 4 – 3 × 1. We can evaluate this expression by writing it as a sum of terms. 7 × 4 – 3 × 1 = 7 × 4 + – 3 × 1 = 28 + – 3 = 25 What are her scores in the second and third rounds? What if there is no penalty?

Here, we continue to look for general relationships between quantities in different scenarios, find patterns and, interestingly, even explain why these patterns occur. Remember the importance of describing in simple language, or visualising mathematical relationships, before trying to write them as expressions. Formula Detective Look at the picture given.

Where would design C appear for the nth time? We can see that this design appears in positions that are multiples of 3. So the nth occurrence of Design C will be at position 3n. Similarly, find the formula that gives the position where the other Designs appear for the nth time. The positions where B occurs are 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, and so on. We can see that the position of the nth appearance of Design B is one less than the position at which Design C appears for the nth time.

Given a position number can we find out the design that appears there? Which Design appears at Position 122? If the position is a multiple of 3, then clearly we have Design C.

So the other numbers in the 2 × 2 square can be represented as shown in the grid. Let us find the diagonal sums; a + (a + 8), and (a + 1) + (a + 7). Let us simplify them. Since the terms can be added in any order, the brackets can be opened. a + (a + 8) = a + a + 8 = 2a + 8 (a + 1) + (a + 7) = a + 1 + a + 7 = a + a + 1 + 7 = 2a + 8 We see that both diagonal sums are equal to 2a + 8 (8 more than 2 times a). Verify this expression for diagonal sums by considering any 2 × 2 square and taking its top left number to be ‘a’. Thus, we have shown that diagonal sums are equal for any value of a, i.e., for any 2 × 2 square!

Now we can find the number of matchsticks at any step quickly. You might have already noticed that there is a 2 in the first step also, 3 = 1 + 2. Using this, the expression we get is 2y + 1. Does the above expression also give the number of matchsticks at each step correctly? Are these expressions the same?

Activity 1 Draw two lines on a plain sheet of paper so that they intersect. Measure the four angles formed with a protractor. Draw four such pairs of intersecting lines and measure the angles formed at the points of intersection. What patterns do you observe among these angles? In Fig. 5.2, if ∠a is 120°, can you figure out the measurements of ∠b, ∠c and ∠d, without drawing and measuring them? We know that ∠a and ∠b together measure 180°, because when they are combined, they form a straight angle which measures 180°. So, if ∠a is 120°, then ∠b must be 60°. Similarly, ∠b and ∠c together measure 180°. So, if ∠b is 60°, then ∠c must be 120°. And ∠c and ∠d together measure 180°. So, if ∠c is 120°, then ∠d must be 60°. Therefore, in Fig. 5.2, ∠a and ∠c measure 120°, and ∠b and ∠d measure 60°. When two lines intersect each other and form four angles, labelled a, b, c and d, as in Fig. 5.2, then ∠a and ∠c are equal, and ∠b and ∠d are equal! Is this always true for any pair of intersecting lines? Check this for different measures of ∠a. Using these measurements, can you reason whether this property holds true for any measure of ∠a? We can generalise our reasoning for Fig. 5.2, without assuming the values of ∠a. \u0007Since straight angles measure 180°, we must have ∠a + ∠b = ∠a + ∠d = 180°. Hence, ∠b and ∠d are always equal. Similarly, ∠b + ∠a = ∠b + ∠c = 180°, so ∠a and ∠c must be equal. Adjacent angles, like ∠a and ∠b, formed by two lines intersecting each other, are called linear pairs. Linear pairs always add up to 180°. 107"}
{"id": "class 7__maths__p126__c1", "text": "Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 Opposite angles, like ∠b and ∠d, formed by two lines intersecting each other, are called vertically opposite angles. Vertically opposite angles are always equal to each other. From the above reasoning, we conclude that whenever two lines intersect, vertically opposite angles are equal. Such a justification is called a proof in mathematics. Figure it Out List all the linear pairs and vertically opposite angles you observe in Fig. 5.3: Linear Pairs ∠a and ∠b, … Pairs of Vertically Opposite Angles ∠b and ∠d, … Measurements and Geometry You might have noticed that when you measure linear pairs, sometimes they may not add up to 180°. Or, when you measure vertically opposite angles they may be unequal sometimes. What are the reasons for this? There could be different reasons: • Measurement errors because of improper use of measuring instruments — in this case, a protractor • Variation in the thickness of the lines drawn. The “ideal” line in geometry does not have any thickness! But it is not possible for us to draw lines without any thickness In geometry, we create ideal versions of “lines” and other shapes we see around us, and analyse the relationships between them. For example, we know that the angle formed by a straight line is 180°. So, if another line divides this angle into two parts, both parts should add up to 180°. We arrive at this simply through reasoning and not by measurement. When we measure, it might not be exactly so, for the reasons mentioned above. Still the measurements come out very close to what we predict, because of which geometry finds widespread application in different disciplines such as physics, art, engineering and architecture. 5.2 Perpendicular Lines Can you draw a pair of intersecting lines such that all four angles are equal?

Activity 6 In Fig. 5.25, if ∠f is 120° what is the measure of its alternate angle ∠d? We can find the measure of ∠d if we know ∠b because they are vertically opposite angles. Remember, vertically opposite angles are equal. What is the measure of ∠b? It is 120° because it is the corresponding angle of ∠f. So, ∠d also measures 120°. In fact, ∠f = ∠b irrespective of the measure of ∠f. Why? Because ∠b is the corresponding angle of ∠f. Similarly, ∠b = ∠d irrespective of the measure of ∠b. Why? Because ∠d is the vertically opposite angle of ∠b. So, it must always be the case that ∠f = ∠d Using our understanding of corresponding angles without any measurements, we have justified that alternate angles are always equal. Alternate angles formed by a transversal intersecting a pair of parallel lines are always equal to each other. Example 1: In Fig. 5.26, parallel lines l and m are intersected by the transversal t.

So, ∠6 is 130°. Angles ∠3 and ∠6 are called interior angles. Is there a relation between ∠3 and ∠6? You could try to find the relationship by taking different values for ∠3 and see what ∠6 is.

Solution: Let us observe the parallel lines AB and CD. AD is a transversal of these two lines. 65° 60° A B C D Fig. 5.29 We know that the sum of the interior angles formed by a transversal on a pair of parallel lines adds up to 180°. So ∠ADC + ∠DAB = 180° 60° + ∠DAB = 180°. So ∠DAB = 120°. Can we find ∠CAB from this? ∠DAB = ∠DAC + ∠CAB. So 120° = 65° + ∠CAB. So ∠CAB = 55°. Let us observe the parallel line segments AD and BC. They are intersected by a transversal CD. So, ∠ADC + ∠BCD = 180°, because they are interior angles on the same side of the transversal. Since ∠ADC is given as 60°, ∠BCD = 120° Similarly, we find ∠ABC = 60°. Therefore, in Fig. 5.29, ∠CAB = 55°, ∠ABC = 60°, and ∠BCD = 120°. 122"}

Clearly, any number in a circle cannot be less than 6 or greater than 24. The grid has sums 5 and 26. Therefore, this is impossible! In the earlier grids which we solved, Kishor noticed that the sum of all the numbers in the circles was always 90. Also, Vidya observed that the sum of the circled numbers for all three rows, or for all three columns, was always 45. Check if this is true in the previous grids you have solved. Why should the row sums and column sums always add to 45? From this grid, we can see that all the row sums added together will be the same as the sum of the numbers 1 – 9. This can be seen for column sums as well. The sum of the numbers 1 – 9 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45. A square grid of numbers is called a magic square if each row, each column and each diagonal, add up to the same number. This number is called the magic sum. Diagonals are shown in the picture.

Surprisingly, the number of ways to fill in the grid can be found without listing all of them. We will see in later years how to do this.

What are the possible numbers that could occur at the centre of a magic square? Let us consider the possibilities one by one. Can the central number be 9? If yes, then 8 must come in one of the other squares. For example, In this, we must have 8 + 9 + other number = 15. But this is not possible! The same issue will occur no matter where we place 8. So, 9 cannot be at the centre. Can the central number be 1? If yes, then 2 should come in one of the other squares. Here, we must have 2 + 1 + other number = 15.

The turtle carried a 3 × 3 grid on its back, with the numbers 1 to 9 arranged in a magical pattern. Magic squares were studied in different parts of the world at different points of time including India, Japan, Central Asia, and Europe. Indian mathematicians have worked extensively on magic squares, describing general methods of constructing them. The work of Indian mathematicians was not just limited to 3 × 3 and 4 × 4 grids, which we considered above, but also extended to 5 × 5 and other larger square grids. We shall learn more about these in later grades. The occurrence of magic squares is not limited to scholarly mathematical works. They are found in many places in India.

(Virahāṅka–Fibonacci Numbers) is one of the most celebrated sequences in all of mathematics — it occurs throughout the world of Art, Science, and Mathematics. Even though these numbers are found very frequently in Science, it is remarkable that these numbers were first discovered in the context of Art (specifically, poetry)! The Virahāṅka–Fibonacci Numbers thus provide a beautiful illustration of the close links between Art, Science, and Mathematics. Discovery of the Virahāṅka Numbers The Virahāṅka numbers first came up thousands of years ago in the works of Sanskrit and Prakrit linguists in their study of poetry! In the poetry of many Indian languages, including, Prakrit, Sanskrit, Marathi, Malayalam, Tamil, and Telugu, each syllable is classified as either long or short. A long syllable is pronounced for a longer duration than a short syllable — in fact, for exactly twice as long. When singing such a poem, a short syllable lasts one beat of time, and a long syllable lasts two beats of time. This leads to numerous mathematical questions, which the ancient poets in these languages considered extensively. A number of important mathematical discoveries were made in the process of asking and answering these questions about poetry. One of these particularly important questions was the following. How many rhythms are there with 8 beats consisting of short syllables (1 beat) and long syllables (2 beats)? That is, in how many ways can one 27 20 25 22 24 26 23 28 21 139"}

Phrased more mathematically: In how many different ways can one write a number, say 8, as a sum of 1’s and 2’s? For example, we have: 8 = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2, 8 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1, 8 = 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2, 8 = 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2, etc. Do you see other ways?

The reason this method works is that every 5-beat rhythm must begin with either a ‘1+’ or a ‘2+’. If it begins with a ‘1+’, then the remaining numbers must give a 4-beat rhythm, and we can write all those down. If it begins with a 2+, then the remaining number must give a 3-beat rhythm, and we can write all those down. Therefore, the number of 5-beat rhythms is the number of 4-beat rhythms, plus the number of 3-beat rhythms. How many 6-beat rhythms are there? By the same reasoning, it will be the number of 5-beat rhythms plus the number of 4-beat rhythms, i.e., 8 + 5 = 13. Thus, there are 13 rhythms having 6 beats. Use the systematic method to write down all 6-beat rhythms, i.e., write 6 as the sum of 1’s and 2’s in all possible ways. Did you get 13 ways? This beautiful method for counting all the rhythms of short syllables and long syllables having any given number of beats was first given by the great Prakrit scholar Virahāṅka around the year 700 CE. He gave his method in the form of a Prakrit poem! For this reason, the sequence 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, . . . is known as the Virahāṅka sequence, and the numbers in the sequence are known as the Virahāṅka numbers. Virahāṅka was the first known person in history to explicitly consider these important numbers and write down the rule for their formation. Other scholars in India also considered these numbers in the same poetic context. Virahāṅka was inspired by earlier work of the legendary Sanskrit scholar Piṅgala, who lived around 300 BCE. After Virahāṅka, these numbers were also written about by Gopala (c. 1135 CE) and then by Hemachandra (c. 1150 CE). In the West, these numbers have been known as the Fibonacci numbers, after the Italian mathematician who wrote about them in the year 1202 CE — about 500 years after Virahāṅka. As we can see, Fibonacci was not first, nor the second, not even the third person to write about these numbers! Sometimes the term “Virahāṅka–Fibonacci numbers” is used so that everyone understands what is being referred to. So, how many rhythms of short and long syllables are there having 8 beats? We simply take the 8th element of the Virahāṅka sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ... Thus, there are 34 rhythms having 8 beats. 141"}

There are three such comparisons to be made. 3. For each set of lengths seen so far, you might have noticed that in at least two of the comparisons, the direct length was less than the sum of the other two (if not, check again!). For example, for the set of lengths 10 cm, 15 cm and 30 cm, there are two comparisons where this happens: 10 < 15 + 30 15 < 10 + 30 But this doesn’t happen for the third length: 30 > 10 + 15. Will this always happen? That is, for any set of lengths, will there be at least two comparisons where the direct length is less than the sum of the other two? Explore for different sets of lengths. Further, for a given set of lengths, is it possible to identify which lengths will immediately be less than the sum of the other two, without calculations? [Hint: Consider the direct lengths in the increasing order.] Given three sidelengths, what do we need to compare to check for the existence of a triangle? When each length is smaller than the sum of the other two, we say that the lengths satisfy the triangle inequality. For example, the set 3, 4, 5 satisfies the triangle inequality whereas, the set 10, 15, 30 does not satisfy the triangle inequality.

Thus, the whole is divided into 18 × 12 equal parts. So, 1 18 × 1 12 = 1 (18×12) = 1 216. Thus, when two fractional units are multiplied, their product is 1 (product of denominators). We express this as: 1 b × 1 d = 1 b × d . 2. Find the following products. Use a unit square as a whole for representing the fractions and carrying out the operations.

The value we get by dividing 7 18 into 12 equal parts is 7 (12 × 18) . 1 18 12 parts 18 parts 7 18 18 parts 12 parts 181"}

From this we can see that, in general, a b × c d = a × c b × d . This formula was first stated in this general form by Brahmagupta in his Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta in 628 CE. The formula above works even when the multiplier or multiplicand is a whole number. We can simply rewrite the whole number as a fraction with denominator 1. For example, 3 × 3 4 can be written 3 1 × 3 4 = 3×3 1×4 = 9 4. And, 3 5 × 4 can be written 3 5 × 4 1 = 3 × 4 5 × 1 = 12 5 .

Can we frame a rule that tells us how to divide two fractions? Let us consider the previous problem. In every division problem we have a dividend, divisor and quotient. The technique we have been using to get the quotient is: 1. First, find the number which gives 1 when multiplied by the divisor. We see that the resulting number is a fraction whose numerator is the divisor’s denominator and denominator is the divisor’s numerator. For the divisor 3 5 this fraction is 5 3. We call 5 3 the reciprocal of 3 5. When we multiply a fraction by its reciprocal, we get 1.

This can be rewritten as: a b ÷ c d = a b × d c = a × d b × c. As with methods and formulas for addition, subtraction, and multiplication of fractions that you learnt earlier, this method and formula for division of fractions, in this general form, was first explicitly stated by Brahmagupta in his Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta (628 CE). So, to evaluate, for example, 2 3 ÷ 3 5 using Brahmagupta’s formula above, we write: 2 3 ÷ 3 5 = 2 3 × 5 3 = 2 × 5 3 × 3 = 10 9 .

She used 1 4 litre of milk for this. How much milk is there in each cup of tea? Leena used 1 4 litres of milk in 5 cups of tea. So, in 1 cup of tea the volume of milk should be: 1 4 ÷ 5. Writing this as multiplication, we have: 5 × (milk per cup) = 1 4. We perform the division as follows as per Brahmagupta’s method: The reciprocal of 5 (the divisor) is 1 5. Multiplying this reciprocal by the dividend ( 1 4 ), we get 1 5 × 1 4 = 1 20. So, each cup of tea has 1 20 litre of milk.

A Dramma-tic Donation The following problem is translated from Bhāskarāchārya’s (Bhāskara II’s) book, Līlāvatī, written in 1150 CE. “O wise one!

So, one cowrie shell was given to the beggar. You can see in the answer Bhāskarāchārya’s humour! The miser had given the beggar only one coin of the least value (cowrie). Around the 12th century, several types of coins were in use in different kingdoms of the Indian subcontinent. Most commonly used were gold coins (called dinars/gadyanas and hunas), silver coins (called drammas/tankas), copper coins (called kasus/panas and mashakas), and cowrie shells. The exact conversion rates between these coins varied depending on the region, time period, economic conditions, weights of coins and their purity. Gold coins had high-value and were used in large transactions and to store wealth. Silver coins were more commonly used in everyday transactions. Copper coins had low-value and were used in smaller transactions. Cowrie shells were the lowest denomination and were used in very small transactions and as change. If we assume 1 gold dinar = 12 silver drammas, 1 silver dramma = 4 copper panas, 1 copper pana = 6 mashakas, and 1 pana = 30 cowrie shells, 1 copper pana = 1 48 gold dinar ( 1 12 × 1 4) 1 cowrie shell =____ copper panas 1 cowrie shell =____ gold dinar. A Pinch of History As you have seen, fractions are an important type of number, playing a critical role in a variety of everyday problems that involve sharing and dividing quantities equally. The general notion of non-unit fractions as we use them today — equipped with the arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — developed largely in India. The ancient Indian geometry texts called the Śhulbasūtra — which go back as far as 800 BCE, and were concerned with the construction of fire altars for rituals — used general non-unit fractions extensively, including performing division of such fractions as we saw in Example 3. Fractions even became commonplace in the popular culture of India as far back as 150 BCE, as evidenced by an offhand reference to the reduction of fractions to lowest terms in the philosophical work of the revered Jain scholar Umasvati. 194"}
{"id": "class 7__maths__p213__c1", "text": "Working with Fractions General rules for performing arithmetic operations on fractions — in essentially the modern form in which we carry them out today — were first codified by Brahmagupta in his Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta in 628 CE. We have already seen his methods for adding and subtracting general fractions. For multiplying general fractions, Brahmagupta wrote: “Multiplication of two or more fractions is obtained by taking the product of the numerators divided by the product of the denominators.” (Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta, Verse 12.1.3) That is, a b × c d = a × c b × d . For division of general fractions, Brahmagupta wrote: “The division of fractions is performed by interchanging the numerator and denominator of the divisor; the numerator of the dividend is then multiplied by the (new) numerator, and the denominator by the (new) denominator.” Bhāskara II in his book Līlāvatī in 1150 CE clarifies Brahmagupta‘s statement further in terms of the notion of reciprocal: “Division of one fraction by another is equivalent to multiplication of the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second.” (Līlāvatī, Verse 2.3.40) Both of these verses are equivalent to the formula: a b ÷ c d = a b ×d c = a × d b × c . Bhāskara I, in his 629 CE commentary Āryabhaṭīyabhāṣhya on Aryabhata’s 499 CE work, described the geometric interpretation of multiplication of fractions (that we saw earlier) in terms of the division of a square into rectangles via equal divisions along the length and breadth. Many other Indian mathematicians, such as Śhrīdharāchārya (c. 750 CE), Mahāvīrāchārya (c. 850 CE), Caturveda Pṛithūdakasvāmī (c. 860 CE), and Bhāskara II (c. 1150 CE) developed the usage of arithmetic of fractions significantly further. The Indian theory of fractions and arithmetic operations on them was transmitted to, and its usage developed further, by Arab and African mathematicians such as al-Hassâr (c. 1192 CE) of Morocco. The theory was then transmitted to Europe via the Arabs over the next few Bhāskara I’s visual explanation that 1 5 x 1 4 = 1 20 1 20 1 5 1 4 195"}

{"id": "class 7__phe__p3__c1", "text": "The National Education Policy 2020 envisages a system of education in the country that is rooted in Indian ethos and its civilisational accomplishments in all domains of human endeavour and knowledge while at the same time preparing the students to constructively engage with the prospects and challenges of the 21st century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured the students’ inherent abilities touching upon all the five planes of human existence, the pañchakośhas in the Foundational and the Preparatory Stages have paved the way for the progression of their learning further at the Middle Stage. Thus, the Middle Stage acts as a bridge between the Preparatory and the Secondary Stages, spanning three years from Grade 6 to Grade 8. The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages — including at least two languages native to India — to Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different Foreword"}
{"id": "class 7__phe__p4__c1", "text": "curricular areas as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy — a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. The book for Physical education and well-being, titled Khel Yatra for Grade 7, is meticulously designed to develop motor skills and engage children in the team sports of Badminton, Football and Kabaddi. Age-specific aspects of Yoga are designed to lay the foundation for healthy living. The textbook aligns with the competencies included in the NCF-SE 2023 for this stage. Khel Yatra emphasises the importance of physical activity and the values and dispositions essential for life. It incorporates cross-cutting themes, such as inclusion, gender equality, and cultural rootedness. The content and activities are designed to encourage peer group learning, and enrich the educational experience for both students and teachers. While this textbook is valuable, children should also explore interesting local games and play with friends. This book is not only useful for school learning, but is a valuable resource for parents and community. However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so."}

Considering the focus on holistic well-being, NCF-SE has mandated Physical Education and Well-being as a core curricular area for all stages of school education. To help the teachers and students achieve curricular goals of Physical Education and Well-being, for the first time a textbook has been designed for Grade 7. This book enables students to experience the joy of playing, explore diverse physical activities, practice fitness skills, learn basic sports skills, and immerse in the world of yoga. Sports and physical activities teach important motor skills, socio-emotional awareness and regulation, associated cognitive abilities, as well as the values of self-discipline, hard work, teamwork, and a gracious acceptance of one’s strengths and vulnerabilities. To achieve the goals of fitness, sports and holistic well-being, the Grade 7 textbook is designed to have five units. 1. Foundational Basis of Physical Education and Well-being 2. Physical Motor Fitness 3. Fundamental Skills of Badminton 4. Fundamental Skills of Football 5. Fundamental Skills of Kabaddi 6.

Through playing games and engaging in discussions, students will understand the importance of living a healthy lifestyle and how physical activity adds to their overall enjoyment and success. Students will also learn about the safety measures to minimize the risk of injuries and create a healthy environment for the students. In Unit 2, students learn different fitness components like endurance, strength, flexibility, and balance. The main aim is to understand how each of these components contributes to overall health. In the Units 3, 4 and 5 focus is on learning new games. Badminton is introduced in Unit 3, Football in Unit 4 and Kabaddi in Unit 5. Through interactive sessions and group exercises, students will discover the excitement of sport and health advantages of physical activity. The emphasis will be on inclusivity, team cohesion, and enjoyment of movement. In the last unit, students immerse in the holistic nature of yoga. They learn about Yama (social discipline) and Niyama (Personal discipline) to inculcate healthy habits for positive behavior. Systematic practice of various yogasanas starting with Sūkshma Vyāyāma (loosening exercises), preparatory breathing practices and step-by-step performance of each asana helps our body to be flexible, strong, balanced and disease free. Various techniques of Prānāyāma strengthen the lungs, improves functioning of major systems of our body, calm down the mind, improve concentration and help in achieving overall harmony and well-being. To explore the world within us and experience deep sense of peace, tranquility and bliss, students learn different techniques of Dhārana (single pointed concentration) and Dhyāna (meditation). Learning various yogic practices lays foundation for long and healthy life.

Structure and Flow of Classes NCF-SE 2023 has recommended 120 periods for physical education and well-being in Grade 7. Suggestive timetable assumes at least 5 periods of 40 minute each, per week. NCF-SE recommends allocating block period (2 periods together) for physical education and well- being. If it is not possible to allocate two block periods and one single period every week, it is necessary to design single periods with different focus to ensure sufficient time for activities, game and circle time. Suggestions are given below for two different scenarios of timetable. • Scenario 1 – Five single periods per week. • Scenario 2 – Two block periods for Units 1 to 4 and single period for yoga. Scenario 1: Three different types of sessions have been visualised to effectively use the limited time in each period and achieve the learning outcomes. • Type 1: Maximizes game practice. • Type 2: Maximizes circle time after play to provide sufficient time for discussing cognitive and socio-emotional aspects. • Type 3: Maximizes gamified drills to focus on one specific skill.

To incorporate yoga into our daily routine, it is necessary to practice ‘Yoga in action’ (Karma Yoga), as taught by Shri Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita. The Bhagavad Gita defines yoga as ‘Yogaḥ Karmasu Kauśalam (2.50),’ which means ‘Yoga is skill in action.’ This means doing our tasks in a relaxed and focused way to get the best results. Think about a Kho-Kho player. They are not just running fast; they are also incredibly calm and focused, even when the game gets intense. That is a lesson for all of us. Whether we are studying, playing a sport, or learning a new skill, it is not just about working hard and stressing out. It is about staying calm, focusing our attention and truly enjoying the process. Sri Aurobindo highlights that yoga is about overall personality development at the physical, mental, intellectual, emotional and spiritual levels. It is about growing in all areas of life. Imagine a big tree. For it to be strong and healthy, all its parts—roots, trunk, branches and leaves—must grow together. Similar to this, we must grow in all facts of life to achieve balance and strength. How can we grow in different aspects and achieve holistic development? Yoga helps us understand the connection between our body, mind, and inner self. Similarly, in Pancha Kosha (पंच कोष) Yoga for Daily Life Yoga for Daily Life Chapter 1"}

These layers are body, energy, mind, wisdom and bliss. Various Yoga techniques help nurture each of these layers, enhancing our overall well-being. Let us understand each Kosha and its role in holistic development. The Pancha Kosha framework helps us understand ourselves better. It gives us insight into both our inner and outer worlds, helping us become more self-aware, empathetic and purposeful. Annamaya Kosha (Physical Sheath) Pranamaya Kosha (Energy Sheath) Vijnanamaya Kosha (Wisdom sheath) Manomaya Kosha (Mind Sheath) Anandamaya Kosha (Bliss Sheath) 1. Annamaya Kosha (Physical Sheath) This is the outermost layer, which is our physical body—the part we can see, touch and feel. It's made from the food we eat. Playing sports, running, eating healthy food, occasional fasting, living with nature and sleeping well are the ways to make us healthy. Yoga postures help strengthen and balance our physical body. Just like a plant needs water and sunlight to grow, our body needs food, exercise and rest to stay healthy."}

This layer is powered by ‘Prana,’ our life energy, which we get from breathing. Prana is like invisible rivers inside us, helping our lungs, heart and everything else work together. Breathing connects us to the air and the earth, giving us energy. We can strengthen our Prana with special exercises like Prānāyāma, Mudra, and Kriyā, helping us feel strong and healthy. 3. Manomaya Kosha (Mind Sheath) This layer is about our thoughts, feelings and perceptions. It is where our emotions and desires come from. It includes what we think, how we feel, and how we react to things. Activities like meditation, mantra chanting (japa), listening to music, singing, painting, and Trataka (focusing on a point) help refine this layer. A calm mind helps you solve problems, stay focused on tasks, and handle challenges easily. When you feel happy or sad, it’s your Manomaya Kosha experiencing those emotions. 4. Vijnanamaya Kosha (Wisdom Sheath) This layer helps us distinguish between right and wrong, good and bad. It is responsible for decision-making, knowledge, wisdom and understanding. Wisdom from this sheath helps us make the right choices, making us better students, friends, family members and responsible citizens of the nation. It also helps us understand our strengths and weaknesses and discover our life’s purpose. When we learn something new at school or figure out what’s right and wrong, it is our Vijnanamaya Kosha at work. Think of it as the map that helps us navigate life."}

A devotee saw Guru Nanak and was concerned. “Your feet are pointing towards our holy place of worship,” he said. “It’s disrespectful.” Guru Nanak, politely asked the devotee to place his feet where there is no holy place. But no matter which way the devotee moved Nanak’s feet, he still saw the place of worship in front of them. Then devotee recognized divinity of Guru Nanak and apologised to him. This story shows us that for Guru Nanak, every place was divine. He believed that God is present in all directions, places and in all creations.

{"id": "class 7__phe__p212__c1", "text": "196 Khel Yatra In this grade let us learn more about breathing through the fourth aspect of Ashtāṅga Yoga which is Prānāyāma. Prānāyāma is the practice of controlling our breath. In Yoga, our breath is considered a powerful tool. Breathing techniques that promote our life force are Prānāyāma. The word Prānāyāma comes from two words: ‘Prana’ means ‘vital energy’ and ‘Yama’ means ‘to control or extend’. So, Prānāyāma is the way by which we consciously control and direct our breath to make ourselves happier and healthier. Why is Prānāyāma Important for students? Just like we need healthy food to stay physically fit, likewise to keep the body energised and calm the mind, we need to do Prānāyāma practices. It’s especially helpful for students because it helps with focus during studies, staying calm during exams, and even feeling more energised for sports or daily activities.

In this grade let us practice what we had learnt in the previous grade like 1. Sectional Breathing Sectional breathing is a preparatory breathing practice for Prānāyāma. It corrects the wrong breathing pattern and increases the vital capacity of the lungs. 2. Nādīśuddhi Prānāyāma Nādīśuddhi Prāṇāyāma is a simple and powerful technique that balances the flow of Prānā (life force) and cleans the subtle energy channels. 3. Bhrāmarī Prānāyāma Bhrāmarī Prāṇāyāma is a calming technique, which has a soothing effect on the mind and nervous system. (Refer to Khel Yatra Grade 6 textbook for the above practices). Let us learn how to perform Bhrāmarī Prānāyāma by adopting Shanmukhi Mudra: Shanmukhi means six gates or faces. Shanmukhi mudra involves redirecting the awareness inside by closing the six doors of outer perception, the two eyes, the two ears, the nose and the mouth. This practice promotes a state of Pratyāhāra. In other words, it closes the six gates of perception in the head with the fingers of both hands."}

Note for the teacher • Ask the students whether they could feel the resonance during the practice. • Ask about their state of mind after the practice. In this grade let us learn about Bhastrikā Prānāyāma stepwise. Bhastrikā Prānāyāma Bhastrikā is a special breathing exercise that gets its name from ‘bellows’, because it's like breathing in and out like a bellows. You can do it slowly or quickly, whichever feels comfortable. During Bhastrikā, you breathe deeply and fully, so your body gets lots of oxygen. You use your chest like a bellows to breathe in and out strongly."}
{"id": "class 7__phe__p215__c1", "text": "199 Yoga There are two parts to Bhastrikā — the first part is like a cleansing breath, and the second part is slower and calmer.

Keep the head and spine straight, and close the eyes and relax the whole body. Step 2: Take a deep breath through both nostrils and fill the lungs with air. Step 3: After full inhalation, quickly exhale continuously for 5 times. This completes one round of Bhastrika. Step 4: Continue this practice for 3 rounds. Benefits • Bhastrikā Prānāyāma strengthens the lungs and improves blood circulation. • It relaxes the body and mind and improves concentration. 7 Limitations: The students with the low stamina should avoid this practice.

Let us continue the practice in this grade. Let us practice Dhārana by focusing on a single point. Jatru Trataka is yogic gazing that helps to bring one pointed concentration or focus. It is a practice where the gaze is fixed on an object or the target. Before starting it is a good idea to cleanse your eyes with cold water.

{"id": "class 7__science__p3__c1", "text": "Foreword The National Education Policy 2020 envisages a system of education in the country that is rooted in an Indian ethos and its civilisational accomplishments in all fields of knowledge and human endeavour. At the same time, it aims to prepare students to engage constructively with the opportunities and challenges of the twenty-first century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. By nurturing students’ inherent abilities across all five planes of human existence (pañchakośhas), the Foundational and Preparatory Stages set the Stage for further learning at Middle Stage. Spanning Grades 6 to 8, the Middle Stage serves as a critical three-year bridge between the Preparatory and Secondary Stages. The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages—including at least two languages native to India—to Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas, as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy—a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. Curiosity, Textbook of Science for Grade 7 aligns with NEP 2020 and NCF-SE 2023, fostering experiential learning through real-world examples. It encourages curiosity, exploration, questioning, and critical thinking."}
{"id": "class 7__science__p4__c1", "text": "iv iv The content attempts to integrate science subjects such as physics, chemistry, biology, and earth science with cross-cutting themes like environmental education, value education, inclusive education, and Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS). By incorporating hands-on activities, the textbook engages students in an integrated approach, promoting reflection and group discussions. The textbook emphasises creativity and innovation, positioning students as active learners. Additionally, the adopted pedagogy encourages critical thinking, reasoning, and decision-making. The textbook provides ample opportunities for peer learning, which enhances the overall learning experience for both teachers and students. The focus is on collaboration and active engagement through student-centred approach to education. However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years. \b Dinesh Prasad Saklani Director New Delhi \b National Council of Educational March 2025 \b Research and Training"}
{"id": "class 7__science__p5__c1", "text": "About this Book We hope you enjoyed exploring the wonderful world of science in Grade 6, guided by the textbook Curiosity. You might still have more questions in science that you wish to explore! The Grade 7 textbook, the second in the Curiosity series picks up where we left off in Grade 6, continuing this exciting journey and helping you explore even more questions that you may wonder about. The Grade 7 textbook has been carefully crafted in alignment with the recommendations of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023. The textbook has been designed to meet curricular goals, covering key scientific concepts like matter, the physical and living world, health, hygiene, and the connection between science, technology and society. Like the Grade 6 textbook, this textbook also focuses on the nature of science and its processes. Each chapter includes creative activities, thought-provoking questions, and helpful illustrations. The textbook combines concepts from biology, chemistry, physics, and earth science, while weaving in cross-cutting themes like value education, inclusive education, environmental education, and the Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS). The goal is to encourage hands- on learning rather than rote memorisation. Through this approach, the Curiosity series aims to help learners think critically and become responsible members of society. Curiosity, Textbook of Science for Grade 7, has twelve chapters. Chapter 1, titled ‘The Ever-Evolving World of Science’, gives an overview of the ideas covered in the book and aims to get the readers excited about learning more about science. It develops a thread connecting all other chapters, showing how they are all linked together. It also highlights that science is primarily a way of thinking, observing, asking questions, and discovering by doing. It is a process rather than a compilation of facts. This fun introductory chapter is meant to excite the students and is non-evaluative. The chapters start with real-life situations to grab the students’ attention and to help them relate with their previous knowledge. The activities in the book are designed to give learners hands-on and minds-on experiences. These activities are inclusive and encourage working together to promote collaborative learning. After each activity, there are questions to help learners check their understanding and see how much they have learnt. We hope the questions make the students think deeply, reflect, and analyse ideas critically to arrive at a conclusion."}
{"id": "class 7__science__p6__c1", "text": "vi vi To sustain the readers’ interest, some challenging ideas, additional information, interesting facts, and other engaging materials are presented in various boxes. Fascinating Facts The ‘Dive Deeper’ boxes contain advanced concepts that lead to questions for in-depth exploration of a topic. Dive eeper The ‘Holistic Lens’ offers horizontal connections to a concept from multiple perspectives. Holistic Lens ‘Science and Society’ links with real-life applications showing how science has contributed to societal development. Science and Society Some chapters also feature sections called ‘Know a Scientist,’ where students can learn about the contributions of Indian and international scientists related to the relevant topics. Know a Scientist This section includes brief biographies and shows how scientists have made a difference. Each chapter includes highlighted words that emphasise key concepts explained in the chapter. Some highlighted words outline the procedures in scientific activities. An interesting non-evaluative element that has been incorporated in some of the chapters is the introduction of certain verses from various Indian texts to promote rootedness in the learners as envisaged in NEP 2020. The box ‘Fascinating Facts’, highlights fun facts, interesting observations, and curiosity-driven questions."}
{"id": "class 7__science__p7__c1", "text": "vii ‘In a Nutshell’ presents the summary of a chapter, offering an overview of the key ideas discussed. In a Nutshell Let Us Enhance Our Learning ‘Let Us Enhance Our Learning’ includes a range of exercises, from pictorial questions and puzzles to multiple-choice questions, offering a challenging and engaging experience. These questions not only help in self-evaluation but also evaluate the competencies developed in each chapter. We recommend that questions for evaluation be similar to the ones in this section. Exploratory Projects A unique feature of the book is ‘Exploratory Projects’, which involves activities designed to encourage the interaction of learners with their peers, parents, teachers, experts, and the community. Learners are encouraged to gather diverse information and draw their own conclusions. Some projects may require prior preparation and collaboration. The textbook is just one way to learn. Learners should also explore and observe their surroundings. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can further enhance learning when used appropriately. The QR codes across the textbook provide access to interactive resources like audio and video clips, puzzles, games, quizzes, and additional content, allowing learners to explore at their own pace and convenience. The journey of each learner through this science textbook is expected to be filled with joy. We hope that the curiosity sparked by this book will continue in the higher grades! We express our gratitude to all the members of the Textbook Development Committee for their contributions in shaping this textbook. We look forward to the feedback of the readers.

This again, is not just a textbook with facts — it is an invitation to question, to perform experiments, and to explore, as we try to understand the beautiful world we live in. The world of science covers everything — small and large, near and far. We may be looking at tiny cells inside a leaf, or the movement of the sun and the stars. We may be testing out the materials around us at home, or discussing how water ﬂ ows underground. As you go through the chapters in this book, you will start new adventures that challenge your thinking, expand your knowledge, and help you become an explorer, making small discoveries for yourself. Before we dive into our exciting journey, take a moment to observe something special about this book. Look at the page numbers — they follow the playful ﬂ ight of a butterﬂ y and the soaring of a paper plane! Just as a butterﬂ y ﬂ utters freely and a paper plane ﬂ ies into the sky, learning takes ﬂ ight when curiosity leads the way. Did you know that something as simple as a paper plane inspired real scientiﬁ c explorations of ﬂ ight? From early inventors studying bird wings to modern engineers designing aircraft, the dream of ﬂ ying started with simple observations and experiments. So, as you turn each page, let your imagination take ﬂ ight — exploring new ideas, discovering wonders, and reaching for the skies!"}
{"id": "class 7__science__p22__c1", "text": "Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 2 Exploration, of course, isn’t just about discovering new facts or learning about diﬀ erent things in nature. Science, as we said in Grade 6, is a process, so it is about a way of thinking that welcomes curiosity, asks questions, and is open to the unknown. In Grade 7, we will try to ask deeper questions: How do things work? Why do events happen the way they do? And what can we learn from the patterns that we see in nature? To do this, we have to step out of this book, step out of the classroom perhaps, and experience the world through activities and experiments. These are experiences that we hope will not just be interesting or exciting but also serve as stepping stones to a deeper understanding of the environment we live in and of our place on this planet. We believe that this will also help you to see science as an ongoing process of discovery. And not just about discovery alone, but also about responsibility. As young science explorers, you will soon see how human activities are linked to what happens in the natural world and are connected to the society we live in. You will, we hope, also see the role that science can play in addressing environmental challenges and help in creating a more sustainable world. But let’s get back into this book for now. You will read about topics in diﬀ erent ﬁ elds of science, from physics and chemistry to biology and earth sciences. While they might appear as diﬀ erent chapters, just as we had said in Grade 6, they are all interconnected. Scientiﬁ c ideas in one area often inspire discoveries in another, or at least allow us to ask questions in another area. So, let’s take a quick journey through our book for this year. We will start by looking at the properties of materials around us, mostly the things we experience but perhaps never ask questions about — why are some fruits sour? What happens when we wash a haldi stain on our school uniform?"}
{"id": "class 7__science__p23__c1", "text": "The Ever-Evolving World of Science 3 We then move on and play with some electric batteries, lamps and wires to try to ﬁ nd other kinds of properties of materials. What kind of materials do we need to make a lamp glow? This will lead us to classifying materials based on their properties — and we will enter the world of metals and non-metals. We know from our experience that a torch battery runs out eventually, and can’t be used again. We’ll explore what kind of changes happen around us. Some changes can be reversed and others cannot be reversed. Batteries run out, ice melts into water, fruits ripen, rocks break into pebbles… what kind of changes are these? Some of these happen, or happen faster, when things are heated. We will look at how heat ﬂ ows — whether it is the melting of an ice cube in a glass, or the melting of a glacier. Water is, of course, everywhere, and with the heat from the Sun, it evaporates from the seas and falls as rain, perhaps trickling down into the ground, somewhere far away."}
{"id": "class 7__science__p24__c1", "text": "Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 4 However, it isn’t just changes in materials around us that we see, or the hidden changes in water that we do not see. As we are growing, our bodies are changing as well. Especially around the middle-school years, our bodies are changing rapidly! Why? Not just us humans, there are life processes that are essential to all animals for their survival. To grow, we have to eat and breathe, blood has to circulate the nutrients from the food all over the body and so on. But why animals alone? Don’t plants also need food to grow? How do they get their food? Do they also breathe? How? Over the time that life has evolved on our planet Earth, it has ﬁ gured out how to do this in a beautiful and carefully balanced way. Ah, but what is time? The clock on the wall or a wrist watch tells us the time and how it passes. We get prepared to go to school in the morning and are ready to sleep at night but have you thought about how we measure time? And how fast does something happen? Long before the age of electric clocks and digital watches, early humans observed the shadows of objects in the Sun and used the position of the shadows to tell the time. Light and shadows are not just useful for shadow puppets or to tell the time. Naturally, light helps us see and today, we’ve developed a lot of ways to generate light (so we can read a book at night, even when the Sun doesn’t shine). But, more importantly, asking questions about the nature"}
{"id": "class 7__science__p25__c1", "text": "The Ever-Evolving World of Science 5 of light has given us a very deep understanding of the universe we live in. While we’ll perhaps learn about it only later, light and shadows are not just limited to things around us at home. Even the Earth and the Moon can cast shadows, leading to the fascinating phenomena of eclipses. And of course, we have day and night that depend on receiving light from the Sun. To understand all of this, we need to know how the Earth rotates around its axis, how the Moon goes around the Earth, and the Earth around the Sun. And the consequences of these movements on life on our beautiful planet. While all this might have your head spinning, think about it. Isn’t it amazing that we humans can wonder about the wonderful world we live in? In the chapters that follow, you’ll also make simple observations and do fun experiments, and dive into topics that need careful thinking. Each chapter builds on what you already know and encourages you to ask questions, explore, do hands- on experiments, and think like a scientist! As you will ﬁ nd out, even those experiments that seem to conﬁ rm what we think will happen, might lead to some additional questions that might need more experiments and more questions. 1.1 Happy Exploring! g ppy p Activity 1.1: Question the Answer In school or during tests, you’re usually given questions and expected to ﬁ nd the answers.

Great scientists don’t just answer questions — they ask amazing ones! (Remember last year we had said, “To be a wise person, you must be a whys person”.) Look at the answers below. Your task is to come up with a curious, creative, and fun question or situations that could lead to these answers. There are never any wrong questions, so let your imagination run wild! Since such exercises might not be very familiar, here is an example to help you! Suppose the answer was ‘just make it half!’ — what all could this be a response to? Well, it could range from “How do we ensure getting equal shares of cake?” to “My essay is too long”, or “I can’t ﬁ t this in the envelope” or even “I cannot dance to such a long song”... all very diﬀ erent! So, let’s see what kind of creative questions you can ask!

At the entry gate, siblings Ashwin and Keerthi were greeted with a white sheet of paper. They were curious to know why a white sheet of paper was given to them! A few steps ahead, there was a volunteer spraying a liquid on these sheets of paper. The siblings also got their white sheets sprayed. To their surprise, the words ‘Welcome to the Wonderful World of Science’ appeared on the papers the moment the liquid was sprayed (Fig. 2.1). They were excited and eager to know how this happened and the reason behind it. Their curiosity was partly satisﬁ ed at the ‘Colourful World of Substances’ stall. They saw many activities showing colour changes on mixing diﬀ erent substances. They decided to explore these changes further. Let us join them on this learning adventure.

{"id": "class 7__science__p30__c1", "text": "Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 10 Let us ﬁ nd out! Litmus is a natural substance obtained from lichens. It is available both as a solution and in the form of paper strips, known as litmus paper. The litmus paper is available in two colours—blue and red, as shown in Fig. 2.3. Substances that turn blue litmus paper to red are acidic in nature, while those that turn red litmus paper to blue are basic in nature. Since litmus shows diﬀ erent colours in acidic and basic solutions, it is called an acid-base indicator. Some other substances, both natural and synthetic, can also be used as indicators. Synthetic indicators are made in laboratories, and you will learn more about them in higher grades. HOLISTIC LENS Lichens are formed by the association of two living organisms, a fungus and an alga. They grow on rocks and trees in regions that have abundant rainfall and clean air. Do you ﬁ nd lichens on trees in your neighbourhood? Lichens Now, let us classify the substances sorted in Group A, Group B, and Group C in Table 2.2. The substances in Group A, such as lemon juice, amla juice, tamarind water, and vinegar turned the blue litmus paper to red, implying that these substances are acidic in nature. The substances in Group B, such as soap solution, baking soda solution, lime water, and washing powder solution turned the red litmus paper to blue. Hence, these substances are basic in nature. The substances in Group C, such as tap water, sugar solution, and salt solution, did not change the colour of either litmus paper. Can you predict their nature? These substances are said to be neutral because they are neither acidic nor basic. I am curious to know — what are these red and blue litmus paper strips made of? Why do they change colour when drops of some samples are put on them? Fig. 2.3: Blue and red litmus paper strips"}

You will ﬁ nd that all these substances taste sour. Thus, we can say that substances that taste sour tend to contain acids and are acidic in nature. Caution — Do not taste anything until asked to do so. Do not taste any unknown substance. Some common edible substances and the names of the most common acids present in them are given in Fig. 2.4.

Basic substances are generally slippery to touch. Also, bases generally taste bitter, but everything that tastes bitter may not contain a base. For example, bitter gourd (karela) possesses a bitter taste but is not basic in nature. If litmus is not available, are there some other natural substances that can serve as acid-base indicators?"}

Can you predict why there is a change in colour?"}
{"id": "class 7__science__p38__c1", "text": "Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 18 Initially, when a drop of blue litmus solution is added to the lemon juice solution, the colour of the solution turns red. When lime water is added to this test tube, the colour of the solution eventually changes from red to blue. This shows that the solution in the test tube is no longer acidic. Lime water has neutralised the eﬀ ect of the acid. When the solution of an acid is mixed with the solution of a base in suﬃ cient quantity, we ﬁ nd that the resulting solution is neither acidic nor basic. Such reactions are called neutralisation reactions. In a neutralisation reaction, salt and water are formed with the evolution (i.e., release) of heat. Acid + Base →Salt + Water + Heat There are many examples in everyday life where you can observe the use of neutralisation processes. Let us ﬁ nd out! 2.3 Neutralisation in Daily Life y Situation 1: Keerthi was observing a butterﬂ y in the garden with her hand resting on a tree trunk. Suddenly, a red ant bit her, leaving her skin red with stinging pain (Fig. 2.11). Her brother helped her by applying moist baking soda to the aﬀ ected area, which relieved the pain. What do you think might be the reason for this? When an ant bites, it injects an acidic liquid (formic acid) into the skin. The eﬀ ect of the acid can be neutralised by rubbing moist baking soda, which is a base. What remedies do people use to treat ant bites in your region? Situation 2: On the Farmer’s Portal (an online platform from the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare), a query from a farmer states, “My plants are not growing well lately”. After a detailed discussion, it was found that the excessive use of chemical fertilisers (substances added to soil to help plants grow better) made the soil acidic. What remedy might be provided to him? When the soil is too acidic, the plants do not grow well. It can be treated with lime, which is a base. (Fig. 2.12).

{"id": "class 7__science__p39__c1", "text": "Exploring Substances: Acidic, Basic, and Neutral 19 If the soil is basic, organic matter like manure and composted leaves are added to it. Organic matter releases acids that neutralise the basic nature of the soil. Sometimes, the soil may be neutral, but the plants growing in it may still show poor health, which can be due to the deﬁ ciency of nutrients in the soil. Situation 3: Ashwin’s friend Gurbir stays near an industrial area. He shared with him that the ﬁ sh population in his neighbourhood lake was declining day by day! What do you think might be the causes for this? It may be due to factory waste being released into the lake. If the factory waste is acidic in nature, what could be done to save the ﬁ sh in the lake? The factory waste can be neutralised by adding basic substances before releasing into the lake. Let us wrap up! Now, can you explain why the words ‘Welcome to the Wonderful World of Science’ appeared on Ashwin and Keerthi’s paper sheets when the liquid was sprayed on them? Do you think that one possibility could be using a turmeric solution for the spraying liquid and a soap solution for writing on the paper? In a Nutshell Substances around us may be classiﬁ ed as acidic, basic, and neutral in nature. Extracts of lichen, red rose, red hibiscus, purple cabbage, turmeric, etc., can be used to indicate the nature of substances. Substances that show diﬀ erent colours in acidic and basic solutions are called acid-base indicators. Acids turn the colour of blue litmus to red. Bases turn the colour of red litmus to blue. Extract of red rose gives red colour in acidic solutions and green colour in basic solutions. The yellow colour of turmeric turns red in basic solutions but remains unchanged in acidic and neutral solutions. An acid and a base neutralise each other, forming salt and water, along with the evolution of heat. Many day-to-day problems like a red ant bite, acidic or basic nature of soil, and industrial waste can be attempted to be managed by the process of neutralisation."}

Also, suggest some other ways of grouping the uses of electricity. We use electricity all the time, so let us learn something more about electricity. You have learnt earlier that electricity is generated in multiple ways — by windmills, by using wind energy, by solar panels capturing the Sun’s energy, by falling water and by using natural gas or coal (in the chapter ‘Nature’s Treasures’ in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity). The electric supply from these sources reaches our homes and factories via wires. For example, at home we plug in various devices to the electrical sockets in the wall. However, to learn about electricity, we will focus on a portable source of electricity that most of us may have used. Let us start with its use in a common device like a torchlight. Caution — The danger signs on electric poles and other appliances warn people that electricity can be dangerous if not carefully handled. Never ever perform experiments with power supply at your home or school. Even electricity from portable generators can be dangerous. Use only batteries or cells, like those in torchlights, wall clocks, radios, or remotes, for experiments with electricity. 3.1 A Torchlight g You might have used a torchlight, also called a torch or a ﬂ ashlight. Activity 3.1: Let us explore Take a torchlight similar to the one shown in Fig. 3.1. Observe it carefully. Do you notice a lamp? And a switch? Slide its switch and observe. Does the torch lamp glow? Now slide the switch back to its original position and observe the torch lamp. You might have noticed that in the ﬁ rst position of the switch, the torch lamp glows and in the other position the lamp does not glow. Now, open the torchlight. What do you ﬁ nd inside? Inside the torchlight, you may ﬁ nd two or more electric cells. Why does the torch lamp glow in one position of its switch? Fig. 3.1: A torchlight"}

Do you notice a positive (+) sign and a negative (–) sign marked on the electric cell? Do you also notice that it has a small protruding metal cap on one side and a ﬂ at metal disc on the other side? All electric cells have two terminals; one is called positive (+ ve) while the other is negative (– ve). The metal cap is the positive terminal of the electric cell and the metal disc is the negative terminal. The electric cell is a portable source of electrical energy. 3.2.2 Battery Activity 3.3: Let us experiment Take a torch which uses two cells. Open its cell compartment and take out the cells. Put the cells back in a diﬀ erent order. Also, try reversing the direction of one cell.

The lamp glows when the cells are placed in the order as shown in Fig. 3.3. Notice how the terminals of the two cells are connected. The positive terminal of one cell is connected to the negative terminal of the next cell. Such a combination of two or more cells is called a battery.

Now, carefully look at the arrangements in which the lamp glows. Compare these with those in which the lamp does not glow. Can you ﬁ nd the reason for the diﬀ erence? 3.2.5 An electrical circuit The lamp glows when one terminal of the lamp is connected to one terminal of the electric cell and the other terminal of the lamp to the other terminal of the cell as shown in Fig. 3.9. This setup forms an electrical circuit, which provides a complete path for electric current to ﬂ ow through the lamp. The lamp glows only when current passes through the circuit. The direction of electric current in an electrical circuit is taken to be from the positive to the negative terminal of the electric cell. When the terminals of the lamp are connected with those of the electric cell by wires, the current passes through the ﬁ lament of the incandescent lamp and makes it glow. With an incandescent lamp, it does not matter which of its terminals connects to the positive or negative terminal of the cell. The lamp will glow as long as the circuit is complete and current ﬂ ows through the ﬁ lament. FASCINATING FACTS Sometimes, an incandescent lamp does not glow even when connected to a cell. We say the lamp has ‘fused’ usually due to a broken ﬁ lament. A broken ﬁ lament stops the ﬂ ow of current, preventing the lamp from glowing. Let us now try to make an LED glow. Activity 3.7: Let us experiment Take two electric cells, an LED of any colour, a cell holder that can ﬁ t two cells (Fig. 3.8a), and two lengths of electric wire. Remove about 1 cm of the plastic covering from both ends of each wire to expose the metal. Connect the two wires to the cell holder as shown in Fig. 3.10a.

How will you decide which is the positive terminal of this battery? The terminal of the holder which is connected to the positive terminal of one cell is positive and the one connected to the negative terminal of the other cell is the negative terminal. Now, connect the free end of the battery positive terminal wire to the longer wire of LED, and the free end of the second wire to the shorter wire of LED (Fig. 3.10c). Does the LED glow? Repeat the above step but interchange the wires connected to the LED (Fig. 3.10d). Does the LED glow again? You would have observed that the LED glows in the ﬁ rst case (Fig. 3.10c) and does not glow in the other (Fig. 3.10d). It is because the current can pass through the LED in one direction only. The current passes through the LED only when the positive terminal (longer wire) of the LED is connected to the positive terminal of the battery, and negative terminal (shorter wire) of the LED is connected to the negative terminal of the battery. When current passes through the LED, it glows. Always take care to connect an LED correctly in a circuit to make it glow.

When the safety pin touches both drawing pins, it closes the gap and completes the path, and allows the current to ﬂ ow. We call this the ON position (Fig. 3.8b) where the circuit is closed and current ﬂ ows from the cell’s positive to negative terminal making the lamp glow. When the safety pin does not touch the second drawing pin, the gap in the circuit prevents current ﬂ ow, and the lamp does not glow. In this OFF position (Fig. 3.8a), we say that the circuit is open. Note that a switch can be placed anywhere in a circuit. A switch is a simple device that either completes or breaks a circuit.

Diﬀ erent types of electrical wires are used for diﬀ erent uses. mak DIVE EEPER From Table 3.3, you would have also realised that plastic, rubber, and ceramics are electrical insulators. Have you now understood why wires are covered with those materials? Conductors and insulators are both important. Electrical wires, switches, connectors of plugs, and sockets are made of conductors. Insulators like rubber, plastics, and ceramics are used to cover wires, plug tops, and switches to protect people from electric shocks. Caution — Our body is a conductor of electricity.

Identify the objects that are lustrous in appearance and hard. You might have observed that objects made from copper, aluminium, and iron are lustrous in appearance and are hard. Lustre shown by metals is known as metallic lustre. Materials like copper, aluminium, and iron are known as metals, whereas, coal, sulfur, and wood are non-lustrous and not as hard as metals. Are all metals hard and solid? Not really; some metals like sodium and potassium are so soft that they can be cut with a knife. There is one metal, mercury, that is found in a liquid state at room temperature, which you might have seen in thermometers. Recall the chapter ‘Temperature and its Measurement’ from the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity. Which objects did you ﬁ nd become ﬂ at on beating with a hammer? You must have observed that objects such as a piece of copper, an iron nail, and a piece of aluminium become ﬂ at when beaten; whereas other objects or materials behave diﬀ erently. This property by which materials can be beaten into thin sheets is called malleability. Most metals possess this property. Can you give some examples of metal sheets? You might have seen thin silver foil on some sweets and aluminium foil used for wrapping food items. These are formed due to their malleability. Gold and silver are the most malleable metals."}
{"id": "class 7__science__p64__c1", "text": "Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 44 A piece of coal or a lump of sulfur does not show this behaviour. They break into pieces and are said to be brittle. On the other hand, wood neither gets ﬂ attened into a sheet nor breaks into pieces. Therefore, wood is neither malleable nor brittle. HOLISTIC LENS The impact of iron on the progress of civilisation of India In the Grade 6 Social Science textbook Exploring Society India and Beyond, you learnt about the Harappans. They knew how to use metals like copper and gold. They used these metals to make various objects, from utensils to jewellery. However, you would hardly ﬁ nd any evidence of the Harappans using a very prominent metal iron, which you see a lot around you today. This is because it took a long time before iron was used in day-to-day activities. However, once the use of iron gained prominence in the times that followed, it contributed signiﬁ cantly to the progress of civilisation in India. For instance, due to its strength, agricultural tools like ploughs made from iron were much superior to those used previously. What could be the potential reason that it is generally considered that copper was discovered earlier as compared to iron? w t f I m t 4.1.2 Ductility Where do you ﬁ nd the use of metal wires? You might have seen wires of metals like copper or aluminium in electrical ﬁ ttings. Some ornaments, like bangles, necklaces, earrings, etc., are also made from metal wires. Metal wires play important functions in a variety of stringed musical instruments, such as veena, sitar, violin, and guitar. This property of materials by which they can be drawn into wires is called ductility. This property of ductility is mainly possessed by metals. Gold is so ductile that one gram of it can be drawn into a 2 kilometre-long wire! The ductile nature of metals enables for the creation of this tea strainer with metal wire."}
{"id": "class 7__science__p65__c1", "text": "The World of Metals and Non-metals 45 Have you ever seen wires made of coal or sulfur? Obviously not! We can say that coal and sulfur are not ductile. Do you know that ropes made of steel [a mixture of metal (iron) and non-metal (carbon)] wires can support heavy loads? Therefore, they are used in suspension bridges and in cranes to lift heavy objects.

Coal and wood, on the other hand, produce dull sounds. This property of metals that enables them to produce a ringing sound is called sonority, and metals are said to be sonorous in nature. Oh! The ringing sound of my ghungroos is also due to the sonority of metals. Now, I understand! The ringing sound of the school bell is due to the sonority of metals.

{"id": "class 7__science__p67__c1", "text": "The World of Metals and Non-metals 47 Some discussion points: Which of the spoons get hotter? What does this experiment tell us about heat transfer along the two spoons? You may have noticed that the metal spoon is hotter to touch than the wooden spoon. Even though both spoons are immersed in the water of the same temperature and for the same time. This shows that the heat transfers through the metal spoon, making it hotter. In contrast, the wooden spoon transfers heat poorly. In such cases, the transfer of heat from one point to another of a material is called conduction, and materials that transfer heat are called conductors. Based on the observations, one can say that metals are good conductors of heat, whereas wood is a poor conductor of heat. Now, we can understand why mostly metal vessels are used for cooking, and their handles are made with wood or other materials that do not conduct heat. You will learn more about this in the chapter ‘Heat Transfer in Nature’. 4.1.5 Conduction of electricity Have you ever seen an electrician using a screwdriver? What type of material is used for making its handle? You may have also noticed the electrician wearing rubber gloves and shoes while working. What can be the reason for this?

Do you see any pattern in the glowing of bulbs when using diﬀ erent materials in Activity 4.4? It is observed that all the materials that make the bulb glow are metals. Materials that allow electricity to ﬂ ow through them easily are called good conductors of electricity. In contrast, materials that prevent the bulb from glowing by not allowing electricity to pass through them are called poor conductors of electricity. So, now we can understand that the plastic covering on screwdrivers and rubber gloves protect the electrician from electric shock because these materials are poor conductors of electricity. We learnt that metals are generally hard, lustrous, malleable, ductile, and good conductors of heat and electricity. Now, let us learn how metals behave in the presence of air and water. 4.2 Eﬀ ect of Air and Water on Metals: Iron You would have often noticed that iron objects develop brown deposits when left in the open for a few days. In which conditions would an iron object develop brown deposits? When it comes into contact with dry air only. When it comes into contact with water only. When it comes into contact with both air and water."}

If you are using old iron nails, make sure to remove brown deposits from their surface by scrubbing them with the help of a small piece of sandpaper. Take three clean, dry glass bottles or test tubes with tight-ﬁ tting caps or stoppers. Label them A, B, and C. Take three iron nails and tie each iron nail with a thread. Place one iron nail and some silica gel in the glass bottle ‘A’, and tighten the cap or stopper (Fig. 4.4a). Silica gel makes the air dry. It is the substance that is used in small pouches in some medicine bottles, water bottles, shoe boxes, etc., to keep them dry. Place one iron nail in the glass bottle ‘B’. Pour freshly boiled and cooled water (to remove dissolved gases) into it until the iron nail is completely dipped in it. Now, pour some oil to form a layer over the surface of the water (Fig. 4.4b). The layer of oil on the surface of the water prevents the air from dissolving in the water. Cap the glass bottle tightly. Place one iron nail in the glass bottle ‘C’, and pour some water so that the iron nail is partially dipped. Keep this glass bottle unstoppered. This allows the iron nail to come into contact with both water and air, as shown in Fig. 4.4c. Place all the glass bottles undisturbed at room temperature and observe the changes for 8 – 10 days. Record your observations in Table 4.3.

{"id": "class 7__science__p70__c1", "text": "Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 50 What can you conclude from this experiment? It is observed in glass bottles A and B that the iron nails do not show any brown deposits. What does this observation indicate? This indicates that brown deposits or discolouration on the iron nails do not develop when the iron nail is kept in dry air alone (bottle A) or water alone (bottle B). However, in glass bottle C, the iron nail shows the presence of brown deposits. This indicates that the presence of both water and air is essential for these deposits to develop. Thus, moist air is responsible for the development of brown deposits on objects made of iron. This brown deposit is called rust. The process of formation of rust on objects made of iron is called rusting. Many other metals also exhibit discolouration when kept open in the atmosphere. Have you noticed the formation of a green coating on the surface of copper objects or a black coating on the surface of silver objects? Gradual deterioration of metal surfaces caused by air, water, or other substances is known as corrosion. Do you know that rusting of iron is a serious problem in our country? Every year, an enormous amount of money is spent to replace or repair iron structures damaged due to rusting. The rusting of iron can be prevented by several methods such as painting, oiling, greasing, and applying a protective layer of zinc metal on iron (galvanisation). We will learn about this in higher grades. FASCINATING FACTS The wonder of ancient Indian metallurgy! The Iron Pillar of Delhi was made in the time of Chandragupta II more than 1600 years ago.

Activity 4.8: Let us explore Take some sulfur powder in a glass tumbler. Add a small amount of water to it. What do you observe? You may have noticed that there is no reaction when sulfur is placed in water. Substances like sulfur and phosphorus behave diﬀ erently with air and water than metals. Phosphorus is stored in water as it catches ﬁ re when exposed to atmospheric air. These substances are usually soft and dull in appearance. They are neither malleable nor ductile, and they are not sonorous. They are also poor conductors of heat and electricity. These are called non-metals. Their oxides are acidic in nature. Some other non-metals are oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon, etc. These must not be confused with materials such as plastic, glass, wood, rubber, and paper. These materials are not classiﬁ ed as metals or non-metals because they are not elements. Metals and non-metals are sub-categories of substances called elements. An element is a substance that cannot be broken down into simpler substances. Presently 118 elements are known. These elements are the basic building blocks of all matter.

{"id": "class 7__science__p83__c1", "text": "Changes Around Us: Physical and Chemical 63 We observe that the candle that was not covered (Fig. 5.6a) continues to burn, whereas the candle that was covered with a glass tumbler (Fig. 5.6b) stops burning after some time. Why does this happen? Since the candle covered by the glass tumbler does not have a continuous supply of air, the ﬂ ame gets extinguished soon. The component of air that supports combustion is oxygen. This can be conﬁ rmed by the presence of carbon dioxide in the glass tumbler inverted on the candle. How can you test the presence of carbon dioxide gas? You can test the carbon dioxide gas by adding a small amount of lime water in the petri dish. You will notice that it turns milky. This carbon dioxide was formed by the carbon from the wax and the oxygen from the air. In other words, oxygen is required for combustion. SCIENCE AND SOCIETY If a person’s clothes catch ﬁ re, what is the best way to extinguish the ﬁ re? Wrap a blanket or cloth around the person. This cuts oﬀ the supply of air, and the ﬁ re gets extinguished. Caution — Synthetic blanket or cloth should never be used to put out a ﬁ re, as these can melt and stick to the skin. FASCINATING FACTS Nature’s wonders: You might have seen some insects emitting light in a garden or a ﬁ eld in late evenings. These insects are called ﬁ reﬂ ies, and their light is produced by a chemical change. This type of light production (without heat) in living organisms is called bioluminescence. Fireflies Fireflies Is the Presence of Air Enough for Combustion? We learnt above that combustible substances and oxygen are necessary for combustion. We also know that paper is a combustible substance, but we can keep it in the air for any length of time without it catching ﬁ re. What else is needed to start combustion? Let us learn about this."}

It quickly catches ﬁ re. Do we say that we need a ﬁ re to start the burning process? Take another piece of paper. Using a magnifying glass, focus the sunrays to make the smallest and brightest spot on the paper, as shown in the Fig. 5.7a. Hold it there for some time. What do you observe? We observe that the paper starts to emit smoke, and then catches ﬁ re (Fig. 5.7b). Thus, we ﬁ nd that a substance can burn even without ﬁ re. How do we explain this change? Focusing sunrays on the paper heats it. The temperature of the paper increases with time. After some time, the paper becomes so hot that it starts burning. This minimum temperature at which a substance catches ﬁ re is called its ignition temperature. Since the temperature of the lighted matchstick was already higher than the ignition temperature of the paper, it caught ﬁ re almost immediately. Fig. 5.7(a): Focusing the sunrays using a magnifying glass Fig. 5.7(b): Paper catching fire So, we can conclude that for the combustion process to occur, there are three requirements (Fig. 5.8) — (i) A combustible substance, also called ‘fuel’ (ii) Oxygen (iii) Heat that allows the fuel to reach its ignition temperature. 5.4 Can Physical and Chemical Changes Occur in the Same Process?

Analyse what students are discussing about the burning candle. What do you think? Fig. 5.9: What changes occur when a candle burns? The wax melts and evaporates... I think the wax burns, and new substances are formed… Maybe the wick draws up the liquid wax… Wax melts, ﬂ ows, and solidiﬁ es in diﬀ erent shapes... Maybe... The wax of the candle melts, is carried up the wick, and evaporates due to the heat of the ﬂ ame. The vapour of wax burns to produce a ﬂ ame. The melting of wax, its solidiﬁ cation, and evaporation are physical changes. The burning of vapour on the other hand, is a chemical change. This shows that the burning of a candle involves both physical and chemical changes. KNOW A SCIENTIST The candle you just observed has long been an object of curiosity for several scientists including Michael Faraday, who made signiﬁ cant contributions to several areas of science. In the nineteenth century, Faraday delivered a series of lectures called Chemical History of a Candle. Faraday believed that the candle was the perfect object to introduce scientiﬁ c study. Through it, he discussed diﬀ erences between various physical and chemical processes like melting, vapourisation, and combustion."}

Once something has undergone a change, can we get it back in its original form? g Activity 5.8: Let us think Think again about all the changes that we have discussed or talked about so far. In which of these can we get back the object or substance in the form we started with? Record your observations in Table 5.2. Table 5.2: Can changes be reversed? 5. ... 12. 4. Making popcorn from corn No The original state can be brought back (Yes/No) Melting ice cubes 1. 2. 3. Chopping vegetables Boiling water Change S.No. Yes No Yes Returning to the original object or substance with which we started shows that the changes we brought can be reversed. For example, when ice melts, it can be refrozen into ice. Similarly, when water evaporates, it can be condensed back into liquid water. However, some changes cannot be reversed since we cannot get the original object or substance back after the change. For example, chopped vegetables cannot return to their original size and shape, and making popcorn cannot go back to its original form. Thus, changes around us could be grouped into those that can be reversed and those that cannot be reversed. 5.6 Are All Changes Desirable? g Many useful changes happen in our daily life. For example, the changing of milk into curd, ripening of fruits, cutting of fruits, and cooking of food. All these are desirable changes. Can you think of some other desirable changes happening around you?"}
{"id": "class 7__science__p87__c1", "text": "Changes Around Us: Physical and Chemical 67 On the other hand, some changes may be undesirable, such as the rusting of iron or the decay of food during its storage. A change that is undesirable in some situations may be desirable in other situations. For example, decomposition of food can be very useful in converting food waste into compost. Some changes occurring over the years due to human activity can have a long-term environmental impact. For example, the increased consumption of fuels in cars, trains, aeroplanes, etc., is increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Drying of paint on walls, doors, furniture, etc., releases many substances through evaporation, causing atmospheric pollution. 5.7 Some Slow Natural Changes g 5.7.1 Weathering of rocks Have you seen heaps of sand, soil, and stones lying at the base of mountains as shown in Fig. 5.10a? These are called sediments. How have these formed? These are formed by physical changes that break up large rocks into smaller pieces. Temperature changes due to climatic conditions, growing roots of trees, and even freezing of water within cracks in the rocks can cause them to break. Water or chemicals present in water, can also react with the rocks and cause chemical changes in their composition. An example of such a chemical change is shown in Fig. 5.10b. Here, an originally black-coloured rock called basalt, which contains iron, has chemically changed to produce a red-coloured layer. The red colour is a result of the iron oxide produced when the rock surface was exposed for a long time to water or air containing water vapour. These physical and chemical changes in rocks are collectively called weathering, which eventually leads to the formation of soil. (a) (b) Fig. 5.10: (a) Sediments at the base of a cliff (b) red sediment layer"}
{"id": "class 7__science__p88__c1", "text": "Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 68 5.7.2 Erosion Have you noticed ﬁ ne sand collecting on riverbeds or in lakes? This sand is formed when rock pebbles, soil, and sediments are broken down and moved from one location to another by natural forces like wind and ﬂ owing water. This process is called erosion. Erosion during a landslide is an example of a physical change. River rocks and pebbles often appear smoother due to the constant erosion caused by the ﬂ owing water. When the speed of the water or wind decreases, such as in an ocean or a lake, the material transported during erosion settles down at the bottom. These sediments harden over time and become new rocks. Most of these changes take place over thousands of years and cannot be reversed. In a Nutshell A physical change is one in which a substance or object undergoes a change in its physical properties and no new substance is formed. A chemical change is one in which one or more new substances are formed. It involves a chemical reaction and can be represented by a chemical equation. Combustion, cooking, and rusting are examples of chemical changes. Substances that undergo combustion are combustible substances. Heat and/or light are given out during combustion. The lowest temperature at which a substance can catch ﬁ re is called its ignition temperature. Some changes can be reversed and some cannot. Some changes are desirable and some are not. Rocks undergo physical and chemical changes due to weathering to form soil. Erosion caused by ﬂ owing water and wind is a physical change."}

With proper nourishment, the seed becomes a sapling and matures into a young plant. This journey is marked by some specific changes. Some of the visible changes are an increase in its height, the appearance of more leaves, and the development of flowers, fruits, and new seeds. From these seeds, new plants emerge. It is quite unlikely that a seedling will develop the capabilities to produce its own seeds immediately after germination. It needs to grow and reach maturity to become capable of producing seeds. Similarly, animals also need to grow and reach maturity before they can reproduce. Some animals lay eggs that hatch into young ones, while others, like humans, directly give birth to young ones. In both cases, the young ones gradually grow in size and develop over time."}

Each person experiences these stages at their own pace, and the duration of each stage may vary from one individual to another. From infancy to adulthood, our bodies undergo various changes. Until around 10–12 years of age, most changes are related to height and weight. After this, other noticeable changes begin to occur, marking the onset of adolescence. This is a period of rapid growth and development, typically occurring between the ages of 10–19. During adolescence, the body prepares for adulthood. Humans, like most other living beings, can not reproduce immediately after their birth. Their bodies need to grow and reach a stage of maturity to be able to reproduce. As humans grow and develop, they experience significant physical, emotional, and behavioural changes, along with the ability to reproduce. Some of these changes may be quite clearly observable, while others occur internally and may go unnoticed. In this chapter, you will explore adolescence, understand its importance, and learn how to handle it with a sense of responsibility. 6.1 Growing With Age: The Teenage Years During the summer vacation, Venkatesh visited his grandparents.

It is usually a stage of development between childhood and adulthood, and is called adolescence. While analysing Table 6.1, you might have noticed the following: Changes in body structure, weight gain, and strength As boys grow, it might be seen that along with growing taller, they gain weight, their shoulders might become a bit broader, and their chests may get wider. Girls also undergo changes in height and weight, and other body changes like development of breasts. Increase in height From birth, our body undergoes continuous growth and development including an increase in height. However, the increase in height becomes more prominent during adolescence."}
{"id": "class 7__science__p96__c1", "text": "Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 76 Changes in voice In adolescent boys, the growth of the voice box leads to a voice that sounds hoarse. The voice box is a structure in our throat that helps us to speak. The growth may be seen as a bump in the throat region and is called the Adam’s apple. However, it is not noticeable in every individual. The voice box also grows in adolescent girls but it is not as big as in the boys, leading to only slight changes in voice. Changes in facial skin: emergence of pimples Another common occurrence during the adolescent years is a skin condition called acne, in which small, reddish pimples appear. These are commonly visible on the face. Acne occurs due to an increase in oily secretions from the skin during adolescence that can clog the skin pores and lead to infections. While acne is a condition, pimples are a manifestation of it. Appearance of hair in different parts of body Both boys and girls experience the growth of hair in different parts of their bodies, such as the armpits and pubic region. Boys often develop facial hair, which later grows into a moustache and a beard as they move towards adulthood. Some boys may also develop chest hair and back hair, though few boys may have no significant hair growth. Variations in and timing of appearance of hair growth is completely normal. A key point to remember Whether it is a change in height, voice, or facial hair, it is important to recognise that the timing, nature, and extent of these changes vary among individuals. These variations are completely normal. Each person experiences adolescence at his or her own pace, and its duration also varies from one person to another. Adam's apple"}
{"id": "class 7__science__p97__c1", "text": "Adolescence: A Stage of Growth and Change 77 Now, we have understood some of the changes that take place during adolescence, particularly those that are easily observable. Some of these characteristic changes, like change in voice, the growth of facial and chest hair in boys, and the development of breasts in girls are not directly involved in the process of reproduction. However, these characteristic changes help distinguish males from females. For this reason, they are called secondary sexual characteristics. Secondary sexual characteristics are natural signs that the body is preparing for adulthood. They mark the onset of puberty. Puberty is the stage in which the body of an adolescent undergoes external and internal changes to develop into an adult capable of reproduction. 6.2 Changes that Indicate Reproductive Capability Adolescence is marked not only by observable changes but also by internal changes that are not visible from the outside. One such change is the maturation of various parts involved in the process of reproduction. Both boys and girls experience such changes gradually, and these changes are a natural part of the process of growing up. An important internal change associated with adolescent girls is the onset of the menstrual cycle. It recurs generally every 28–30 days and is more commonly known as ‘the period’. Many healthy girls may have longer or shorter menstrual cycles ranging from 21–35 days. The menstrual cycle is an important natural process and is one of the signs of good reproductive health. The phase of the cycle when blood discharge occurs from the body is referred to as menstruation. It may last for three to seven days. Some girls may feel pain or discomfort in the lower abdomen during these days. Usually, by the age of 45–55, menstruation stops naturally, marking the end of the reproductive capability in a woman’s life. Breaking myths about menstruation There are many wrong beliefs about menstruation that often lead to unnecessary fear, shame, or even guilt. These beliefs have given rise to certain myths and taboos. Among such myths and taboos, physical isolation of menstruating girls is unfortunately still quite prevalent. Menstruation is a natural process, and such myths have no scientific basis. By encouraging a scientific outlook towards menstruation, we can help society appreciate the need to promote good reproductive health of women and contribute positively towards a healthier lifestyle for women."}

Maintaining body hygiene, particularly in the armpits and the pubic region, may protect us from potential infections. For girls, maintaining proper hygiene during menstruation is essential for both comfort and health. Menstrual hygiene can be maintained using items such as sanitary pads (Fig. 6.1) and reusable cloth pads designed for this purpose. The government also attempts to provide these products free of charge or at a low price to improve the menstrual hygiene of girls and women. As a society, we should all make efforts to ensure the availability of necessary facilities in schools and public places to promote menstrual hygiene. Collectively, we should move forward, reducing any stigma around sanitary pads and helping in menstrual hygiene. It is important to dispose of used sanitary pads properly by wrapping them in newspaper and disposing inside a dustbin. This is to ensure community health and environmental cleanliness.

We now understand the different changes in adolescence and also know some ways to handle it with a sense of responsibility. Many changes in adolescence, including menstruation and other signs of puberty, are mainly due to hormones — certain chemicals produced in our bodies. Hormones play a crucial role in regulating various aspects of growth and development, contributing to the proper functioning of the body. They are produced in different parts of the body and are released at an appropriate time in response to signals from the brain. Some hormones influence mood and behaviour."}

{"id": "class 7__science__p111__c1", "text": "Heat Transfer in Nature 91 You observed that the pin closest to the candle ﬂ ame (pin I) falls ﬁ rst, followed by pins II, III, and IV. Why does pin I fall before pin II? Why did all the pins not fall together? From your observations, what can you infer? Do you think that heat is being transferred along the metal strip from the end that is being heated? As the heat travels along the strip and approaches a pin, the wax holding it melts and the pin falls. Here, the transfer of heat takes place from the hot end of the strip to the colder end. The process of heat transfer from the hotter part of an object to the colder part is called conduction. In this process, the particle that gets heated, passes the heat on to its neighbour, and so on. However, the particles themselves do not move from their positions. Materials like metals that allow heat to pass through them easily are called good conductors of heat. Because metals are good conductors of heat, we use utensils made of metals for cooking. In solids, heat transfer takes place mainly through the process of conduction. If we use a strip made of a material like wood or glass in place of a metal strip to perform Activity 7.1, the pins will not fall. Can you think of the reason for this based on our learning from the chapter ‘The World of Metals and Non-Metals’? Materials such as glass and wood do not allow heat to pass through them easily and are poor conductors (insulators) of heat. Clay and porcelain are also poor conductors of heat — that is why tea or coﬀ ee kept in such cups stays hot longer.

As a result, we feel warm. Similarly, air trapped between the layers of clothing acts as a poor conductor of heat and keeps us warm. The presence of air between two thin blankets is the reason why we prefer them over one thick blanket to keep us warm (Fig. 7.2). Is it possible to construct houses that are not aﬀ ected much by the outside heat and cold? Houses constructed in places with a very hot or cold climate often use the concept of heat transfer to keep them cool or warm. FASCINATING FACTS The upper regions of the Himalayas, such as the Mori block of Uttarkashi in Uttarakhand, experience an extremely cold climate and heavy snowfall during winters. Houses here are often built to stay warm during winters, with walls made of two wooden layers ﬁ lled with cow dung and mud between them. As wood and mud are poor conductors of heat, they prevent heat loss and help in keeping the houses warm. T i s d d o There are houses with outer walls that are constructed using hollow bricks that keep them warm in winters and cool in summers. This happens because the air that gets trapped in the hollow bricks is a poor conductor of heat.

Table 7.3: Recording observations and probable reasons Observation about the cups Probable reasons for the observation You observed that the cup under which the candle was placed, rises up (Fig. 7.3b). Why is it so? The air around the candle ﬂ ame heats up. As the air in the cup warms up, it expands and occupies more space. As a result, it becomes lighter and rises up. You can experience the expansion of air on heating it by placing a partially inﬂ ated balloon in the Sun (Fig. 7.4). After the air in the balloon gets heated, it expands and the balloon becomes larger. You must have observed that when an incense stick (agarbatti) is burnt, smoke rises up.

Activity 7.4: Let us investigate Caution— This activity should be carried out on a clear, sunny day under the supervision of a teacher or an adult. Take two identical bowls as shown in Fig. 7.6. Fill one bowl halfway with soil and the other bowl halfway with water. Fix a laboratory thermometer in each bowl as shown in Fig. 7.6. Make sure that the bulbs of the thermometer are immersed in soil and water, and do not touch the bottoms or the sides of the bowls. Place the set-up in sunlight. Fig. 7.6: Measurement of the temperature of soil and water Soil Stand Water Thermometer Observe the movement of the coloured streak in the water. As you supply heat, a streak of colour starts moving up and then coming down from the sides (Fig. 7.5b). Why does the streak of coloured water go up in the middle and come down from the sides? The water at the bottom of the beaker gets heated up and becomes hot. It expands, becomes lighter, and rises. The water on the sides of the beaker is comparatively cooler and heavier, and comes down to take the place of the rising water. Then, this water gets heated and in turn also rises. This cycle continues until the entire volume of water gets heated. In this case, the entire volume of water gets heated through the actual movement of water particles. This process of heat transfer is known as convection. It is because of convection that we see the movement of the coloured streak inside the beaker. Thus, we can conclude that water, like air, gets heated up by the process of convection. Here, heat transfer takes place by the actual movement of particles of liquids and gases from one place to another.

After letting the soil and water get heated, bring the set-up indoors and let it cool for 20 minutes. You will observe that the soil cools faster than water, just as it gets heated faster. People living in coastal areas experience an interesting phenomenon caused by the heating and cooling of land and water at diﬀ erent rates. As the land gets heated faster than water during the day, it causes warm air above the land to rise. This causes cooler air to move from the sea towards the land. This movement of cooler air from the sea to the land is called sea breeze (Fig. 7.7a). Hence, in hot places, sea breeze relieves people from the heat. That is why, windows of the houses in coastal areas are placed facing the sea.

In the absence of sunlight, land cools down faster than the water in the sea. As a result, the air above the sea is warmer and rises up. Cooler air from the land then moves towards the sea, creating a land breeze (Fig. 7.7b). Thus, people living near the seashore experience that the direction of the wind reverses in the day and night. 7.3 Radiation Do you remember when Pema and Palden were sitting around the ﬁ replace? They felt warm. Their grandfather tells them that the heat transfer, in this case, takes place directly from the ﬁ re (hot object) to us by a process known as radiation. The heat of the Sun reaches us through this process. Heat transfer by radiation does not require any medium. All objects radiate heat. You must have observed that a hot utensil kept away from the ﬂ ame cools down after some time. What is the reason for it? The hot utensil cools down by radiating heat to its surroundings. Why is it more comfortable to wear white or light-coloured clothes during summers and dark-coloured clothes during winters? Light-coloured clothes reﬂ ect most of the heat that falls on them, and therefore, we feel more comfortable wearing them during summers. Dark surfaces, on the other hand, absorb more heat, and therefore, we feel more comfortable with dark-coloured clothes during winters. c w L t t a DIVE EEPER I wonder how heat from the ﬁ re reaches us?

Consider the case of water being heated up, as shown in Fig. 7.8. Let us identify the various ways in which the pan and the water get heated up, as well as the warmth we feel around the ﬂ ame and the hot pan. Heat is transferred from the ﬂ ame to the utensil by conduction. Subsequently, water in the utensil gets heated up by convection. The warmth that we feel around the ﬂ ame and the hot utensil is due to radiation. Let us wrap up! From the activities, examples, and discussions so far, we ﬁ nd that there are three processes by which heat gets transferred. These are conduction, convection, and radiation. In conduction, heating takes place when one particle receives heat, transfers heat to the next particle in contact, and so on. The particles themselves do not move away from their positions. In convection, heat transfer takes place by the actual movement of particles. Note that in conduction and convection, a medium must be present whose particles help in the transfer of heat. In the case of radiation, heat travels from one place to another and no material medium is required for its transfer. FASCINATING FACTS In the upper reaches of the Himalayan region, a traditional room heater locally known as bukhari is used to keep rooms warm during winters. It consists of an iron stove in which wood or charcoal is burnt. A long pipe attached to the upper part of the heater serves as a chimney, venting out the smoke. Additionally, the bukhari can be used for cooking, as its ﬂ at top provides a platform for placing utensils.

You have seen your parents drying wet clothes on the clothesline at home. Wet clothes dry faster on a sunny day since the heat from the Sun makes the evaporation of water faster. Thus, heat from the Sun plays an important role in the evaporation of water, be it from clothes drying on a line or from water bodies like oceans and lakes. Let us look at the phenomenon of water cycle to understand this in more detail. 7.4 Water Cycle y You have also learnt in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity, that water exists in three states in nature. As a liquid, it ﬁ lls the oceans, rivers, and lakes on the Earth. As a solid, it forms snow, ice sheets, and glaciers in the mountains and the polar regions. As a gas, it exists in the form of water vapour in the Earth’s atmosphere. During summers, some of the snow and ice gets converted to water due to the Sun’s radiation and ﬂ ows down as rivers, and ultimately into the oceans. The melted ice is replenished by fresh snow during winters. Water in the oceans, rivers, and lakes gets heated due to the Sun, and as a result, it evaporates as water vapour. Water also evaporates from trees and plants through transpiration. When water vapour rises up, it cools down and condenses to form clouds. Clouds bring rain, snow, and hail. This process is called precipitation. The continuous movement of water — upward as water vapour and downward through precipitation, passing through soil, rocks, and plants, and ﬁ nally returning to water bodies, is called water cycle (Fig. 7.9). Thus, the water cycle helps in redistributing and replenishing water in rivers, lakes, and oceans. It also serves to conserve the total amount of water on the Earth. Rainwater that falls on the surface of the Earth, ﬂ ows into ponds, lakes, rivers, and oceans or seeps into the ground.

You may have observed that water seeps fastest through gravel, slower through sand, and slowest through clay. Why is it so? The spaces between gravel particles are wider when compared to those in sand and clay. Hence, water can seep through the gravel more easily. In this way, water seeps beneath the surface of the Earth. This process of surface water seeping through soil and rocks is called inﬁ ltration. Water can inﬁ ltrate more readily if the spaces between soil and rock particles are wider, open, and interconnected (Fig. 7.11). The water that seeps through gets stored in the pore spaces of sediments and the openings in rocks beneath the surface as groundwater. The underground layers of sediments and rocks that store water in pore spaces are called aquifers (Fig. 7.12). This is the water we extract by digging wells or drilling bore wells into aquifers. This water may be a few metres to hundreds of metres below the ground, depending on the location. Fig. 7.12: Aquifer Rain Inﬁ ltration Well Aquifer However, groundwater is not unlimited. The growing water requirements of an increasing population have led to excessive groundwater extraction. Additionally, decreased vegetation cover and increased concrete surfaces in urban areas have limited water inﬁ ltration. As a result, groundwater is getting depleted. To address this, rainwater harvesting and recharge pits are used to replenish groundwater. Hence, the water cycle ensures that groundwater sources are recharged, thereby helping to ensure a sustainable groundwater supply.

SCIENCE AND SOCIETY Ice Stupa During the spring season in Ladakh, streams often dry up, leading to scarcity of water as the heat from the Sun’s radiation is not enough to melt the snow on the mountains. During winters, water from mountain streams is channeled down through underground pipes. This water is then sprayed into the cold air. As it falls, it freezes due to extremely low temperatures. The ice builds up layer by layer, creating a tall, cone-shaped structure called an ice stupa as shown in Fig. 7.13.

They started noticing that many events in nature repeat themselves after deﬁ nite intervals of time. For example, the rising and setting of the Sun, the phases of the Moon and the changing seasons. They started using the cycles of these events for timekeeping. First, they devised calendars. A day was deﬁ ned by the cycle of rising and setting of the Sun. Then began the quest to ﬁ nd ways of knowing the time of day. How was time measured when there were no clocks and watches? So, they made many devices which helped them to measure smaller intervals of time within a day. Some of these were sundials, water clocks, hourglasses, and candle clocks. In a sundial, time is determined with the changing position of the shadow of an object cast by the light of the Sun during the day (Fig. 8.1). The water clocks used the ﬂ ow of water out or into a vessel to measure time. In one type, water ﬂ owed out from a vessel which had markings for time (Fig. 8.2a). In the other type, there would be a bowl, with a ﬁ ne hole at the bottom, which was ﬂ oated on the surface of water (Fig. 8.2b). It gradually ﬁ lled up in a ﬁ xed time and ﬁ nally sank. Then, it was lifted up and ﬂ oated again. In an hourglass (Fig. 8.3), time was measured on the basis of the ﬂ ow of sand from one bulb to another.

{"id": "class 7__science__p128__c1", "text": "Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 108 FASCINATING FACTS In ancient India, time was measured using both shadows and water clocks. The earliest reference to shadow-based time measurement appears in the Arthasastra by Kautilya (was composed and revised between the second century BCE – third century CE). An accurate expression for time in terms of the shadow of a vertical stick was given by Varahamihira around 530 CE. The water clock with water ﬂ owing out was described in the Arthasastra, Sardulakarnavadana, and some other texts (early CE centuries). These clocks were not very accurate because as water levels dropped, the ﬂ ow rate decreased. This led to the development of the sinking bowl water clock (Fig. 8.2b), or Ghatika-yantra, ﬁ rst mentioned by Aryabhata, and then in several astronomical texts later. Time was measured constantly with Ghatika-yantra at Buddhist monasteries, royal palaces, town squares, and each time the bowl sank, it was announced by drums, conch shells, or striking a gong. Though the Ghatika-yantra was progressively replaced by pendulum clocks in the late nineteenth century, it continued to be used at the religious places for rituals. n y n , s h Fig. 8.6: Huygens’ Pendulum clock Pendulum As human civilisation advanced, and as people began to travel long distances, the measurement of time became very critical. This led to the development of increasingly better mechanical devices for the measurement of time, driven by weights, gears, and springs from the fourteenth century onwards. However, the invention of the pendulum clock in the seventeenth century marked a major breakthrough in mechanical timekeeping. KNOW A SCIENTIST The pendulum clock was invented in 1656 and patented in 1657 by Christiaan Huygens (1629 –1695). He was inspired by the investigations of pendulums by Galileo Galilei (1564 –1642). It is said that once while sitting in a church, Galileo’s attention was drawn to a lamp suspended from the ceiling, which was swinging back and forth. Using his pulse to measure time, Galileo found that the lamp took the same time for each swing. After experimenting with diﬀ erent pendulums, Galileo concluded that the time taken to complete one oscillation was always the same for a pendulum of a given length.

When the bob of the pendulum is moved slightly to one side and released, it starts oscillatory motion. Its motion is periodic in nature because it repeats its path after a ﬁ xed interval of time. The pendulum is said to have completed one oscillation when its bob, starting from its mean position O, moves to extreme position A, changes direction and moves to another extreme position B, changes direction and comes back to O (Fig. 8.7b). The pendulum also completes one oscillation when its bob moves from one extreme position A to another extreme position B and comes back to A. The time taken by the pendulum to complete one oscillation is called its time period. Let us now set up a pendulum and measure its time period.

The speed of an object is the total distance covered divided by the total time taken to cover it. Thus, Speed = Total distance covered Total time taken What would be the unit of speed? We know the SI units of length and time. Since the speed is distance/time, the SI unit of speed is metre/second and is expressed as m/s. Speed can also be expressed in other units.

The motion of the train between A and B, as well as between C and D, is non-uniform (Fig. 8.11).

Some aquatic animals ﬁ lter tiny food particles ﬂ oating nearby and feed upon them. Animals, including humans, obtain energy from food, which enables them to carry out various life processes. Animals consume food that contains complex components, such as carbohydrate, protein, and fat. These complex food components have to be broken down into simpler forms before the body can use them. But how does this process happen? Breaking down of complex food components into simpler forms occurs in a long tube called the alimentary canal. This process starts in the mouth and ends at the anus (Fig. 9.1). As food moves through this canal, digestive juices secreted at diﬀ erent parts break it down into simpler forms. This simpler form of food is absorbed by diﬀ erent parts of our alimentary canal and transported to various parts of our body to carry out various functions. 9.1 Nutrition in Animals How do the complex food components get broken down into simpler forms and used by the body in various animals?

What do you think is the role of saliva in your mouth? What do you feel when you eat other types of food, such as chapati? Let us ﬁ nd out. Take a small piece of chapati or a bite-sized portion of boiled rice and chew it properly for 30–60 seconds. At ﬁ rst, the chapati or rice has its usual taste, but as you continue chewing, do you notice a change in taste? The food begins to taste sweet! Have you ever wondered why this happens? Chapati or rice contains starch, which is a type of carbohydrate. Our saliva contains a digestive juice that helps break down starch into sugar. This explains why starchy food, like chapati, tastes sweet when you chew it for a long time. Saliva helps to break down components of food into simpler ones.

We should brush our teeth and clean our tongue twice a day, and rinse our mouth with water after each meal to prevent tooth decay and bad smell in the mouth.

What causes the change of colour in test tube A? In Grade 6, we learned that iodine gives a blue-black colour when it reacts with starch. In test tube A, the appearance of the blue-black colour indicates the presence of starch. In test tube B, which contains chewed boiled rice, if there is no change in colour, it indicates that the starch is no longer present; if there is only a slight change in colour, it indicates that starch is present only in very small amount. It has been broken down into simple sugars by the action of saliva. If the colour still appears in test tube B, what changes would you make in the activity to explore it further? Would the colour change if chewing time is increased? Try to ﬁ nd out by repeating the activity. Now, we know that saliva secretion in the mouth helps break down starch into sugars. This process of breaking complex food components into simpler forms in the body is called digestion. Food is partially digested in the mouth. Let us learn how this partially digested food gets further digested through the alimentary canal. Food pipe (Oesophagus): A passage from the mouth to the stomach When you chew your food, your saliva not only helps in digesting the starch but also moistens it, making it soft and easy to swallow. Your tongue helps in mixing chewed food with saliva and pushing this softened food into a long, ﬂ exible tube called the food pipe or oesophagus (Fig. 9.2). But how does the food move down? The walls of the food pipe gently contract and relax in a wave-like motion to push the food down into the stomach. This movement takes place throughout the alimentary canal and pushes the food forward. Stomach In the stomach, the walls contract and relax to churn the food. The churned food is then mixed with a secretion from the inner lining of the stomach. The secretion from stomach contains digestive juice, acid, and mucus.

{"id": "class 7__science__p145__c1", "text": "Life Processes in Animals 125 The digestive juice of the stomach breaks down proteins present in the food into simpler components. The acid not only helps break down proteins but also kills many harmful bacteria. The mucus protects the stomach lining from the acid, preventing damage. In the stomach, the food is partially digested and transformed into a semi-liquid mass, preparing it for the next stage of digestion. Fig. 9.3: Stomach Digestive juice, acid and mucus Stomach wall FASCINATING FACTS How did scientists learn about digestion in the human body? The discovery of how the stomach works happened by chance. In 1822, a man named Alexis St. Martin was accidentally shot in the stomach. He was treated by a doctor, William Beaumont. However, his wound never fully healed, leaving a small permanent hole. This opening allowed Dr. Beaumont to observe digestion in the stomach as it happened. He conducted experiments on how diﬀ erent foods were broken down and studied how emotions aﬀ ect digestion. Alexis St. Martin’s shotgun wound Small Intestine After its journey through the stomach, the partially digested food moves into the small intestine. Look at Fig. 9.4. It is a sketch of a stretched-out alimentary canal. Guess how long it is. You will be surprised that although it is called small intestine, it is almost 6 metres long—almost twice the height of your classroom! You will be surprised to know that the small intestine is the longest part of the alimentary canal. The small intestine receives digestive secretions from three sources—the inner lining of the small intestine itself, and two more structures associated with the alimentary canal—the liver and the pancreas (Fig. 9.4). The liver secretes bile, which is mildly basic in nature. Recall the neutralisation reaction in chapter ‘Exploring Substances: Acidic, Basic, and Neutral’. Bile neutralises acids present in the food moving down from the stomach and breaks down fats into tiny droplets, making its digestion easier.

{"id": "class 7__science__p146__c1", "text": "Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 126 The pancreas secretes pancreatic juice, which is also basic in nature and helps neutralise acids present in the food. Additionally, pancreatic juice also breaks down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. The digestive juice secreted by the wall of the small intestine further breaks down fats, proteins, and partially digested carbohydrates into simpler forms. The digested nutrients pass on from the small intestine into the blood present in blood vessels found in the walls of the small intestine. This process is called absorption of nutrients. How are these nutrients absorbed from the small intestine? The inner lining of the small intestine is thin and has thousands of ﬁ nger-like projections (Fig. 9.5) that increase the surface area for eﬃ cient nutrient absorption. These ﬁ nger-like projections allow the digested nutrients to pass into the blood, which carries them to diﬀ erent parts of the body. These nutrients provide energy, support growth and repair, and help the body function properly. Fig. 9.5: Inner lining of the small intestine 0.5 mm Large intestine After most of the nutrients are digested and absorbed in the small intestine, what happens to the undigested food? It moves into the large intestine. The large intestine is about 1.5 metres in length. It is shorter than the small intestine. Then why is it called the large intestine? The reason is that it is wider than the SCIENCE AND SOCIETY Celiac disease is a condition in which the body reacts to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. This reaction damages the inner lining of the small intestine, where nutrients are absorbed. As a result, the intestine cannot function properly. The only way to manage celiac disease is to avoid foods that contain gluten. Millets (like jowar, bajra, and ragi) are good alternatives because they are naturally gluten-free."}

The large intestine absorbs water and some salts from the undigested food, thus making the waste semi-solid. This semi-solid waste is called stool. The stool is then stored in the lower part of the large intestine, called the rectum, until the body is ready to get rid of it. Eating ﬁ bre-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains helps the large intestine function properly by making the stool easier to pass. Finally, it is expelled through the anus—a process known as egestion. This is how your body removes the waste it does not need, keeping you healthy! Isn’t it fascinating how the digestive system works, absorbing nutrients from food and eliminating waste? FASCINATING FACTS The large intestine contains various small living organisms, such as bacteria, that help in digestion. They help in keeping our digestive system healthy. They break down undigested food, especially ﬁ bre, and produce essential nutrients. Fibre-rich food, and especially ‘fermented foods’ (like curd, buttermilk, shrikhand, kanji, pickles, gundruk, and poita bhat) are good for a healthy digestive system and overall well-being. SCIENCE AND SOCIETY The importance of digestion in maintaining good health has been recognised for centuries. The Charaka Samhita, an ancient Ayurvedic text, highlights the role of easily digestible foods and the judicious use of spices like ginger, black pepper, and cumin to enhance digestion. Advances in science in the area of nutrition also emphasise eating meals at proper timings, practising mindful eating, and avoiding overeating as key factors in maintaining digestive health. 9.1.2 Do all animals digest food the same way as humans do? I have seen cows keep chewing the food even when they are not actively grazing or eating anything. Why?"}
{"id": "class 7__science__p148__c1", "text": "Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 128 Grass-eating animals, such as cows (Fig. 9.6) and buﬀ aloes, partially chew the grass and swallow it into their stomachs. In the stomach, partial digestion of the food takes place. The partially digested food is brought back to the mouth for gradual chewing. This process is called rumination, and these animals are called ruminants. A cow spends about 8 hours a day just chewing the food! The thoroughly chewed food again passes down the alimentary canal for further digestion. Fig. 9.6: Digestive system of a ruminant Oesophagus Small Intestine Rumen Pancreas Fig. 9.7: Digestive system in birds Fig 9 7: Digestive system in b Gizzard Intestine Stomach Oesophagus Birds do not have teeth, but they have a chamber called a gizzard (Fig. 9.7). Food is broken down by the contraction and relaxation of the walls of the gizzard, often with the help of grit (small stones) that the birds swallow. This shows that animals exhibit variations in the structure and function of the alimentary canal to adapt to diﬀ erent ways of digesting diﬀ erent kinds of food. We have learnt that the nutrients from digested food are carried to diﬀ erent parts of the body. Some of the nutrients help build and repair the body, while others, like sugar, are broken down inside the body to release energy. The process by which nutrients are converted into usable energy is called respiration. Let us now explore how this process occurs in animals. 9.2 Respiration in Animals p We learnt in Grade 6 chapter ‘Living Creatures: Exploring their Characteristics’, that all living beings respire. Is the process of respiration the same in all animals? Let us ﬁ rst understand the process of respiration in humans."}
{"id": "class 7__science__p149__c1", "text": "Life Processes in Animals 129 9.2.1 Respiration in humans You know that we breathe in (inhale) and breathe out (exhale) air continuously to obtain oxygen and release carbon dioxide. How is this oxygen used in the body? Are breathing and respiration diﬀ erent? Let us ﬁ nd out. How do we breathe? The process of inhaling and exhaling air is called breathing. It is diﬃ cult to live without food for a week; without water for a day or two, but without breathing, we usually cannot survive more than a few minutes. Why is that? All of us are alive because we breathe. Not just humans, plants and other animals also breathe. But how do we breathe? Just as food follows a speciﬁ c pathway in the digestive system, our body also has a speciﬁ c system for breathing and respiration. This system is called respiratory system. The respiratory system consists of various parts as shown in Fig. 9.8. In this system, the exchange of gases follows a speciﬁ c pathway. The pathway through which the air is inhaled and exhaled involves various parts of the respiratory system assisting in the process of breathing and respiration. The respiratory system begins with a pair of nasal openings called nostrils through which we inhale and exhale air (Fig. 9.8). The inhaled air passes into a pair of small passages called the nasal passages. Have you noticed tiny hair inside your nostrils? These hair, along with mucus, help trap dust and dirt from the air we breathe in. This is why we should breathe through the nose and not through the mouth. From the nasal passages, the air reaches our lungs through the windpipe. The windpipe forms two branches, which enter the two lungs. In the lungs, these branches further divide into smaller and ﬁ ner branches that end in small balloon-like sacs called alveoli (Fig. 9.8). Our lungs are protected by the rib cage. Rib cage Left lung Right lung Diaphragm Windpipe Alveoli Nostrils Fig. 9.8: Human respiratory system SCIENCE AND SOCIETY While a lot of the dust is ﬁ ltered out from the inhaled air, often small infectious particles can get through the lungs. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 virus aﬀ ected the respiratory system, leading to breathing diﬃ culties and often causing serious lung problems."}

What changes do you see in the balloons? When you pull the rubber sheet downwards, the balloons inﬂ ate. Conversely, when you release the rubber sheet upwards, the balloons deﬂ ate. When you breathe in (inhale), your chest expands as the ribs move up and outwards. The diaphragm (a dome-shaped muscle below the lungs) moves downwards during inhalation (Fig. 9.10a). This increases the space inside the chest, and air enters the lungs.

The lime water in test tube B turns milky (or cloudy), but the lime water in test tube A does not. What does this indicate? Lime water turns milky when it reacts with carbon dioxide. Therefore, this indicates that the exhaled air contains more carbon dioxide than the air we inhale. SCIENCE AND SOCIETY Breathing Practices for a Healthy Life Breathing exercises have been practised across diﬀ erent cultures in India and worldwide for centuries. Pranayama is well known for improving respiratory health, mind relaxation, and concentration. In Ladakh, people practise Tummo breathing, a technique that improves lung function and helps keep the body warm even in cold weather. Similarly, deep breathing techniques are used to promote well-being. Some traditions combine deep breathing with chanting, using rhythmic breath control to enhance relaxation and mental clarity."}
{"id": "class 7__science__p152__c1", "text": "Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 132 How does the exchange of gases happen? Through the process of breathing, fresh air from outside enters the lungs and ﬁ lls the alveoli. The alveoli have thin walls surrounded by ﬁ ne tubes containing blood (Fig. 9.12). Blood carries carbon dioxide from the body to the alveoli, where it is released into the air. At the same time, oxygen from the alveoli passes into the blood and is transported to all parts of the body. Have you ever wondered how the food you eat gives you energy? The key is not only the food but also the oxygen we breathe! When we eat food, our body breaks it down into simple substances like sugar (glucose). Oxygen helps break down glucose to release energy. This process is called respiration. The word equation of the process of respiration is as follows— Glucose + Oxygen Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy During breathing, we inhale air from our surroundings and exhale air having more carbon dioxide than the inhaled air. Note that not all the oxygen is used up (Fig. 9.13). Some other animals can use a larger fraction of the oxygen during respiration. This exchange of gases ensures that each segment of our body gets oxygen to produce energy and remove waste products. In simple words, breathing brings in oxygen and removes carbon dioxide, while respiration uses oxygen to break down food and release energy. This energy helps us walk, run, play, and even think! Breathing is a physical process, while respiration is a chemical process that occurs inside the body. Both the processes are essential for our survival!

This system is called the circulatory system. It includes the heart, blood, and blood vessels. The heart pumps blood through blood vessels, ensuring the transport of nutrients, oxygen, and other substances to all parts of the body, while waste products are carried away. p y SCIENCE AND SOCIETY Smoking is extremely harmful to health. It damages the lungs and increases the risk of serious diseases, including lung cancer and other respiratory illnesses. It leads to persistent coughing and frequent infections. In addition to harming the smoker, smoking releases toxic chemicals into the air, putting others at risk. When non-smokers inhale this polluted air, they experience passive smoking, which can be especially dangerous for children, pregnant women, and the elderly. Due to these risks, avoiding smoking helps protect both personal health and the well-being of those around us. 9.2.2 Do other animals breathe the same way as humans do? You have learnt that diﬀ erent animals live in diﬀ erent habitats. You may have observed birds ﬂ ying and ﬁ sh swimming. How do they breathe? Animals, such as birds, elephants, lions, cows, goats, lizards, and snakes, breathe through their lungs. Although all these animals have lungs, the structure of their lungs are quite diﬀ erent. Most aquatic animals like ﬁ sh, have specialised structures known as gills (Fig. 9.14). These are richly supplied with blood vessels. The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the blood and the gases dissolved in water takes place across the gills. Amphibians, like frogs, live both on land and in water. They use diﬀ erent body parts for breathing at various stages of their life. For example, tadpoles breathe through gills, while adult frogs use lungs for breathing on land and skin for gas exchange when they stay in water. This adaptation helps them survive both in water and on land, showing how animals have adapted over time to diﬀ erent environments. Earthworms use their moist skin for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Gills Fig. 9.14: Breathing body parts in a ﬁ sh"}

You will study about them in higher grades. In a Nutshell Life processes such as nutrition, circulation, respiration, excretion, and reproduction are essential for the survival of living beings.

Caution — Alcohol should never be placed near a heat source directly, as it is highly ﬂ ammable and can easily lead to ﬁ re and burns.

DIVE EEPER DIVE EEPER In Activity 10.1, we have learnt that water and sunlight are essential for plant growth. In Activity 10.2, we have discovered that green leaves store starch as food. Bhaskar loves gardening during his free time. Being a curious student, he often looks around his garden and wonders how plants produce food. From his experiences, Bhaskar knows that water and sunlight are essential for plant growth. But he wonders if sunlight contributes to the production of food in the form of starch in plants. How does sunlight contribute in the production of starch in plants? Activity 10.3: Let us check Bhaskar took a leaf having both green and non-green patches from each of two similar potted plants — one kept in sunlight and the other kept in the dark for 36 hours. He wanted to compare the leaves before and after the starch test. He made a sketch of the leaves to record the location of the green and the non-green patches on them with the help of a tracing paper. After that, he performed an iodine test (as shown in Activity 10.2) on the leaves. Bhaskar recorded his observations in Table 10.2."}

Non-green patches of the leaf obtained from the plant placed in sunlight do not turn blue-black. Does it indicate that there is no chlorophyll present in those patches? The non-green patches may not have suﬃ cient chlorophyll to prepare enough starch to be detected using the iodine test. FASCINATING FACTS Some plant leaves appear red, violet, or brown because they contain more of these coloured pigments than the green-coloured chlorophyll. This hides the green colour. Some of these pigments also help in photosynthesis. You can use an iodine test to check for the presence of starch in these leaves, indicating that photosynthesis has indeed taken place. t"}

As we know, leaves are mostly green because of the presence of chlorophyll. We have also seen that the starch is produced where green patches of the leaf are present. We can infer that chlorophyll helps in preparing starch in the presence of sunlight. In fact, it is essential for the preparation of starch. Hence, the leaves are also called ‘food factories’ of plants. What else is essential for the preparation of food in plants? Let us ﬁ nd out. 10.2.2 Role of air in the preparation of food Activity 10.4: Let us experiment (demonstration activity) The teacher may demonstrate this activity. Take a potted green plant and keep it in the dark for two to three days to allow it to destarch (i.e., lose any stored starch).

However, the part of the leaf inside the bottle does not turn blue-black in colour, indicating that food is not made in that part of the leaf. This is because the caustic soda solution inside the ﬂ ask absorbs the carbon dioxide present in the air. What does this experiment show? This experiment shows that carbon dioxide present in the air is essential for plants to prepare starch. Based on Activities 10.3 and 10.4, what do you conclude? Which part of the plant is involved in the synthesis of starch? Based on our learnings so far, we have found that sunlight, water, chlorophyll and carbon dioxide are essential for the synthesis of food in plants. This process by which plants prepare food in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll is called photosynthesis. A leaf is the primary site for photosynthesis. Do other green parts of the plant also perform photosynthesis? Yes, other parts of the plants which have chlorophyll also perform photosynthesis.

During photosynthesis, food is actually produced in the form of glucose, a simple carbohydrate. This glucose not only serves as an instant source of energy but also later gets converted into starch for storage. The word equation of photosynthesis is given below — Sunlight Carbon dioxide + Water Glucose + Oxygen Chlorophyll KNOW A SCIENTIST Many scientists across the world contributed to develop an understanding of photosynthesis. In India, Rustom Hormusji Dastur (1896–1961) studied the process of photosynthesis. He was a plant scientist and served as the head of the Botany Department at the Royal Institute of Science, Bombay (now the Institute of Science, Mumbai), from 1921–1935. He studied eﬀ ects of the amount of water and temperature on photosynthesis. He examined the importance of water, temperature, and the colour of light in the process of photosynthesis. 10.2.4 How do leaves exchange gases during photosynthesis? We now know that photosynthesis requires carbon dioxide, and oxygen is released in the process. Which part of the plant helps in the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen?

What do you observe? Do you notice tiny pores on the peel, as shown in Fig. 10.6? These pores are called stomata. Stomata, present on the surface of leaves, help in the exchange of gases. 10.3 Transport in Plants p 10.3.1 Transport of water and minerals All living beings need water to grow. Plants use water in the process of photosynthesis. Water, along with minerals present in the soil, is taken up by the roots of a plant. Minerals are important nutrients for the growth of plants. How do water and minerals taken up by the roots move to all parts of the plant? We can study water transport in plants by carrying out an activity. For this activity, we require two glass tumblers, some water, red ink, and twigs of two similar tender plants, preferably with white-coloured ﬂ owers (for example, white sadabahar, balsam), as shown in Fig. 10.7.

How did diﬀ erent parts of the plant acquire this red colour? Cut the stem from the upper part of the plant that is not immersed in the red-coloured water. Observe the cut stem using a magnifying glass. Do you spot the red colour in the stem (Fig. 10.7e)? How does the red colour ink move upwards? This is due to the thin tube-like structure called the xylem present in the stem, branches, and leaves of plants. Just like red ink, minerals dissolved in water also move up the stem through the xylem. Now, we know that water and minerals are transported to the leaves and other parts of plants through the xylem (Fig. 10.8). The water transported through the xylem is used to perform various functions. How does food get transported to other parts of a plant? 10.3.2 Transport of food We know that leaves are the primary site for photosynthesis. The food prepared by plants in the leaves is transported to all parts of the plant. This food is transported through another set of thin tube-like structures called the phloem (Fig. 10.8).

As we know, carbon dioxide is naturally present in very small quantities in the air. In the ﬂ ask, additional carbon dioxide is produced by the seeds as they respire. During respiration, glucose is broken down in the presence of oxygen, releasing carbon dioxide, water, and energy. The word equation for the proccess of respiration, is as follows — Glucose + Oxygen Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy The energy produced during respiration is used by plants for their growth and development. All parts of a plant, green or non-green, carry out respiration. Thus, plants have diﬀ erent mechanisms for synthesising, transporting, and utilising food to get energy.

FASCINATING FACTS Shadow play, or shadow puppetry, has been a part of our cultural heritage for centuries. In this art form, ﬂ at cut-out ﬁ gures called shadow puppets are placed between a light source and a screen. By moving the puppets and the light, puppeteers can create life-like movements, bringing the characters to life. Diﬀ erent regions have their own unique styles, like the Charma Bahuli Natya in Maharashtra, Keelu Bomme and Tholu Bommalata of Andhra Pradesh, Togalu Gombeyaata in Karnataka, Ravana Chhaya in Odisha, Tholpavakoothu in Kerala, and Bommalattam in Tamil Nadu. These are used not only for entertainment but also communicate important messages to the community. 11.5 Reﬂ ection of Light g When the opaque object was a shiny object like a polished steel plate, I got a shadow on the screen, but I also saw that there was a bright spot of light on the wall on the opposite side. Why was it so? Activity 11.5: Let us investigate Find a shiny ﬂ at steel plate or a plane mirror, that is, a mirror that is ﬂ at and not curved. Take it outside and let the sunlight fall on the shiny surface. What can you do to redirect light on the wall on which the sunlight is not falling directly?"}
{"id": "class 7__science__p180__c1", "text": "Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 160 What conclusion do you draw from your observations? This activity suggests that a shiny surface or a mirror changes the direction of light that falls upon it. This change in direction of light by a mirror is called the reﬂ ection of light. Let us try to understand the reﬂ ection of light by a mirror. Activity 11.6: Let us experiment Fig. 11.8: Using mirror to redirect sunlight on a wall Turn the shiny plate or mirror in diﬀ erent directions to redirect the light onto a wall or a nearby surface (Fig. 11.8). Do you see a spot of light on the wall? Does it mean that the shiny plate or mirror has changed the direction of light? Now, tilt the shiny plate or mirror in diﬀ erent ways and observe the light spot on the wall. Does it change position? Notice how light always travels in straight lines and changes direction when it falls on the shiny plate or mirror. Take a plane mirror with stand, a torch, a comb, a sheet of white paper, and a strip of black paper. Using the black paper, close all openings of the comb, except for one to make a thin slit. Spread a white paper on a table, hold the comb perpendicular to the sheet of paper and shine the torch light on the slit. Adjust the comb and torch slightly till you see a thin beam of light along the paper which has passed through the slit (Fig. 11.9a). Now, place the mirror in the path of the light beam while keeping the comb steady (Fig. 11.9b). What do you observe? The path of the light beam is changed after falling on the mirror. The reﬂ ection of light occurs at the mirror. mirror. In a mirror, I can also see my face. Is that also due to the reﬂ ection of light? (a) Fig. 11.9: (a) A light beam (b) Reﬂ ection of light in a plane mirror (b) Thin slit Plane mirror"}

What you see is a reﬂ ection of your face in the mirror. We also see reﬂ ections of other objects that are in front of the mirror. Let us try to ﬁ nd out more about this. Activity 11.7: Let us experiment Take a plane mirror and a pen or some other object. Place the pen in front of the mirror as shown in Fig. 11.10. What do you see in the mirror? It appears as if a similar pen is placed behind the mirror. The pen which appears behind the mirror is the image of the pen formed by the mirror. The pen itself is the object. Now, move the pen to diﬀ erent positions in front of the mirror and compare the sizes of the images of the pen at each position. Are the two sizes the same? The image formed by a plane mirror is of the same size as the object. Again, move the pen to diﬀ erent positions in front of the mirror and observe if the image is upright at each position. Does the tip of the pen appear on top at each position? An upright image is called erect. An image formed by a plane mirror is erect. Now, place a screen vertically behind the mirror.

Since there are 3 mirrors, and multiple images (due to reﬂ ections of reﬂ ections), many interesting patterns are formed. Designers and artists often use kaleidoscopes to get ideas for new patterns. In a Nutshell Objects that emit their own light are called luminous objects. Light travels in a straight line. Light passes almost completely through transparent materials. Light passes partially through translucent materials. Light does not pass through opaque materials. A shadow is formed when light is blocked by an object. Opaque objects form darker shadows. Translucent objects make lighter shadows.

Rashmika had been noticing that the coconut tree shadows were long in the morning but shorter in the afternoon on her way back. She thought about it and decided that the size of the shadows changed because the Sun moved across the sky during the day. But she also remembered learning that the Earth moved around the Sun (in chapter ‘Beyond Earth’ in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity) so she was puzzled.

While you are sitting on the moving merry- go-round, look around you. Do the objects around you appear to be moving? In which direction do they appear to be moving? While you turn in the anti-clockwise direction, the objects appear to turn around you in the opposite direction, that is, in the clockwise direction. Now ﬁ x your gaze at a particular tree (or a building) ahead of you while sitting on the merry- go-round turning around in anti-clockwise direction.

Using the observations made by us while riding a merry-go- round, let us now think. When we view from the Earth, the Sun appears in the East, moves across the sky from the East to the West and disappears in the West. Does it indicate that the Sun is moving in the sky?

This value is impressively close to the currently accepted value. I have seen that the stars and constellations that appear in the East at sunset change during diﬀ erent months. Yes.

The Earth’s axis of rotation is not upright with respect to the orbit, but is tilted. The Earth maintains this tilt as it orbits around the Sun (Fig. 12.9). The tilt of the Earth’s axis and the spherical shape of the Earth gives rise to seasons. Let us ﬁ nd out, how.

As seen in Fig. 12.10a, a given amount of sunrays are spread in a smaller area in the Northern Hemisphere as compared to the Southern Hemisphere due to the spherical shape of the Earth’s surface. So that area is heated more. Further, the Northern Hemisphere receives sunlight for more than 12 hours in June (Fig. 12.11a). So, the Northern Hemisphere experiences more intense sunlight, which lasts for a longer time, causing the summer season. In December, the situation is opposite in the Northern Hemisphere and it experiences winter season with sunlight for shorter time (Fig. 12.10b and Fig. 12.11b)."}

Two incorrect reasons often given to explain why seasons occur on the Earth are: When the Northern Hemisphere tilts towards the Sun, it is closer to the Sun. The orbit of the Earth is an oval with the Sun slightly displaced from its centre so the Earth is at diﬀ erent distances from the Sun over the year. However, the diﬀ erence in distances in either of these cases is very small and these are not the reasons why seasons occur on the Earth. In fact, the Earth is closest to the Sun in January.

After the summer solstice, the duration of a day becomes shorter while that of a night becomes longer. The shortest day and longest night in this Hemisphere occur around 22 December known as the winter solstice. Around 21 March and 23 September, the daytime lasts for 12 hours. In the Northern Hemisphere, these days are called the spring and the autumn equinox, respectively. DIVE EEPER FASCINATING FACTS At the North Pole, the Sun rises in the East direction on the equinox day — 21 March, and remains continuously in the sky for six months. The Sun sets on 22 September. The South Pole experiences the opposite behaviour. The polar regions thus experience continuous sunshine for six months followed by a six-month period of darkness. F A d T b s On the equator, there is always 12 hours of sunlight and 12 hours of darkness. There is little diﬀ erence in the intensity of the sunrays falling on the equator in diﬀ erent months. Thus, for the southern states of India that lie close to the equator, the eﬀ ect of seasons is not very prominent. Other eﬀ ects, such as local geographical features and proximity to oceans or seas, can also inﬂ uence these broader patterns seen in the two hemispheres, as you have learnt in social science. 12.3 Eclipses p Day and night cycle, seasons, the life on the Earth... so much is dependent upon the Sun. Could the light from the Sun get blocked by the two planets which are revolving between the Earth and the Sun? The planets Mercury and Venus appear very small compared to the Sun, and never block the entire light from the Sun reaching us. However, you may be surprised to know that the Moon can do that. Do you remember studying in Grade 6 that the Moon is a natural satellite of the Earth and it revolves around the Earth as the Earth revolves around the Sun?"}
{"id": "class 7__science__p200__c1", "text": "Curiosity Textbook of Science Grade 7 180 12.3.1 Solar eclipse At certain times, the Moon can come in between the Sun and the Earth in a way that obstructs the light from the Sun from reaching us. This is known as a solar eclipse. You may wonder how the Moon, which is smaller than the Sun, blocks the light coming from the Sun that we see in the sky. Activity 12.4: Let us explore Ask your friend to stand in front of you at a distance of about 5 metres. Consider his head to be the Sun. Now close one eye and show a thumbs up with your outstretched hand towards your friend as shown in Fig. 12.12. Are you able to cover the entire head of your friend with your thumb? You can cover the entire head of your friend with the help of your thumb, even though your thumb is much smaller than the actual size of your friend’s head. How could it be? The size of any object as seen by your eye — also known as apparent size — depends upon both its actual physical size and its distance from you. The thumb being much closer to you as compared to your friend, the apparent sizes of your thumb and your friend’s head as seen by you in Activity 12.4 are similar. The apparent sizes of the Moon and the Sun in the sky are similar when viewed from the Earth. This is so because though the Moon is much smaller in physical size than the Sun, the Moon is much closer to us compared to the Sun. Therefore, the Moon can appear to cover the entire Sun as viewed from the Earth. Though the planets Mercury and Venus are much larger than the Moon in size, they are also much farther from the Earth as compared to the Moon. Thus, their apparent sizes are very much smaller than the Sun and they cannot block the Sun. For example, when Venus passes between the Sun and the Earth, it appears as a tiny black dot passing against the bright face of the Sun. This event, known as a Transit of Venus, is a rare event.

During a total solar eclipse, for a few minutes it turns dark during the day as no sunlight reaches the Earth. Due to the Earth’s rotation and the motion of the Moon in its orbit, the Moon’s shadow moves across the surface of the Earth. Thus, the total solar eclipse is visible only for a few minutes. As the Moon begins to move away from the front of the Sun (Fig. 12.14c), we see a partial solar eclipse and daylight begins to return. Safe Viewing of a Solar Eclipse Caution— During a solar eclipse, one might be tempted to look at the Sun, thinking that it wouldn’t be strong enough to cause harm to our eyes. However, even during the eclipse, the Sun is intense enough to damage the eyes and cause blindness. Thus, directly viewing solar eclipse must be strictly avoided. Also, do not view it through sunglasses, binoculars, or telescopes. Usually, astronomy organisations, such as planetaria and astronomy clubs hold eclipse viewing events during a solar eclipse (Fig. 12.15). Participating in such events is the best way to observe a solar eclipse since the organisers not only provide specialised eye protection for solar viewing, but also oﬀ er scientiﬁ c explanations.

A mirror can be used to project an image of the Sun onto a wall. However, holding it at the correct angle throughout a solar eclipse can be diﬃ cult. To solve this, make a movable stand for the mirror. Use a hollow ball with a small hole, half-ﬁ ll it with sand (to keep it stable), and attach a small mirror (such as an embroidery mirror) to it. Place the ball on a circular ring, like an adhesive tape ring, so it can be turned around easily. Adjust it until the Sun’s image appears on a wall or screen. Fig. 12.15 shows this set-up where the mirror is ﬁ xed to a green ball. Caution — This activity should be performed strictly under supervision of a teacher. Take care not to direct the reﬂ ected light beam in anyone’s eyes. r e e e l DIVE EEPER People have observed eclipses and maintained records since ancient times. When the reasons for eclipses were not known, they feared the occurrence of eclipses. As you can imagine, something blocking the Sun, the main source of heat and light on the Earth, even for a brief period of time, would have been extremely concerning. Many superstitions were attached to solar eclipses in various parts of the world related to the activities that could not be carried out during eclipses—such as eating, cooking, or going out of home. But now that we know the reason why a solar eclipse occurs, we need not fear these events as long as we do not look at the Sun directly. In fact, scientists go around the world to observe the eclipses from wherever these are observable. The eclipses provide them an opportunity to study phenomena that cannot be observed otherwise. FASCINATING FACTS An eclipse is known as grahan in Sanskrit and in many Indian languages. Many ancient Indian astronomical texts provide calculations to predict eclipses. The best known and most referred text is the Surya Siddhanta, which is written in the classical Sanskrit poetry tradition in rhythmic shlokas. 12.3.2 Lunar eclipse As the Moon revolves around the Earth, sometimes the Earth can block the sunlight from reaching the Moon. This is known as a lunar eclipse. On such days, we see the Earth’s shadow falling on the full disc of the Moon.

At the same time, it aims to prepare the students to engage constructively with the opportunities and challenges of the 21st century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. By nurturing students’ inherent abilities across all the five planes of human existence, (pañchakośhas), the Foundational and the Preparatory Stages set the stage for the further learning at Middle Stage. Spanning Grade 6 to Grade 8, the Middle Stage serves as a critical three year bridge between the Preparatory and Secondary Stages. The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages — including at least two languages native to India — to Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas, as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy — a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks.

But we will also encounter some words in Sanskrit and a few other Indian languages. The Roman alphabet cannot make their pronunciation clear without some additional marks or signs, such as dashes, dots or accents, called ‘diacritical signs’ or ‘diacritics’. You can ignore all these signs if you wish, and you don’t need to remember them. However, as we are using only a few simple signs, you will find it easy to get used to them. You will also find that they help you pronounce Sanskrit words fairly correctly. Here is how they work:  A short dash (called ‘macron’) over a vowel makes it long. For instance, dāna is pronounced ‘daana’; līlā is pronounced ‘leelaa’; sūtra is sootra.  śh and ṣh are pronounced more or less as ‘sh’ in ‘shall’ (there is a slight difference, since they correspond to श and ष in the Devanagari script, but you can ignore it in practice). So śhāstra is pronounced ‘shaastra’; kṣhīra is ‘ksheera’.  Consonants with a dot below them (ḍ, ṭ and ṇ mainly) are ‘hard’, i.e. pronounced by hitting the tongue on the palate; without a dot, they are soft, with the tongue on the teeth. (As a rough comparison, in the preceding English word ‘teeth’, the first ‘t’ is hard, while the final ‘th’ is soft.) Examples of hard consonants: Āryabhaṭa, gaṇa, paṭhana (studying), pīṭha, goṣṭhī (association, assembly), dhanāḍhya (rich), aṇu (atom)."}

When she asked him, “How does India look from space?”, he replied, “Sāre jahān se achchha” — better than the whole world. (This is the title of a well-known poem of the early 20th century.) LET’S EXPLORE Look at the map of India at the end of this book. What are you able to observe? Recall your lesson on different types of landforms — mountains, plains and plateaus. Which landforms can you identify on the map? What do the different colours on the map mean? (Hint: The legend on the map shows the heights of each area.) As you go through this chapter, remember to refer periodically to the physical map. India is the seventh-largest country in the world, and a part of Asia. Along with its neighbours — Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar — it forms the region known as the Indian Subcontinent (subcontinent, since it is part of the continent of Asia). Often, for the purpose of discussion, we refer to five regions — the great mountain zone, the plains of the Ganga and the Indus, the desert region, the southern peninsula, and the islands. In this chapter, we will ‘fly’ over these zones, providing you with a bird’s-eye view of these features and offering glimpses of what things look like in close-up at some of these places. It would be difficult to go into all the details at this stage since, as you will soon see, India is large and diverse. The Himalayan Mountain range stands as a natural barrier in the north, while the Thar Desert and the Arabian Sea mark its western limits. To the south, the Indian Ocean and to the east, the Bay of Bengal form a natural boundary. These geographical features create a separation between India and the rest of the continent and have played a crucial role in shaping India’s climate, culture, and history."}

LET’S REMEMBER The Himalayas seem to touch the sky. In fact, many of its peaks are over 8000 metres in height and are together called the ‘Eight Thousanders’. This mountain range stretches across six countries in Asia: India, Nepal, Bhutan, China, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Can you name the highest mountain in the world? In the summer, the snow on the mountains melts and feeds major rivers, such as the Ganga, Indus, and Brahmaputra. These rivers and their tributaries provide water for drinking, farming, and industrial use, connecting with the lives of hundreds of millions of people. Hence, the Himalayas are sometimes called the ‘Water Tower of Asia’. The Himalayas are also important to many cultures and belief systems. The mountains themselves are considered sacred, and temples and monasteries have been built within them, attracting monks and spiritual seekers from around the world who come to pray and meditate.

At some point, it broke away and slowly started moving north. About 50 million years ago, it reached the landmass of Eurasia and collided with it. As India pushed against Eurasia, the land between them crumpled and rose up — just like how a carpet wrinkles when you push it. That’s how the mighty Himalayan mountains were formed! Amazingly, India is still pushing into Asia today, very slowly — about five centimetres each year, which is much slower than the rate at which your hair grows. This means the Himalayas are still growing taller, just a tiny bit each year — about five millimetres, but over a millennium, that adds up to five metres! Fig. 1.4. India’s journey to Eurasia Fig. 1.5.

This region remains snow-covered throughout the year. Life here is tough, and there are not many human settlements.  The Himachal (the Lower Himalayas) lie south of the Greater Himalayas and have a more moderate climate, allowing rich biodiversity and human habitation. Popular hill stations, such as Nainital (Uttarakhand), Darjeeling (West Bengal), Shimla (Himachal Pradesh), and Mussoorie (Uttarakhand), are located in this region.  The Shivalik Hills (the Outer Himalayas) form the outermost and lowest range, consisting of rolling hills and dense forests. These foothills are rich in wildlife, serving as a transition zone between the Himalayas and the Gangetic Plains (also called the Northern Plains).

Ladakh is a cold desert where winter temperatures drop below –30°C. There is very little rainfall, and the landscape is rugged, with rocky terrain, deep valleys, and lakes such as Pangong Tso (tso means lake). The terrain here resembles that of the moon; hence, it is called ‘moonland’. Geologists explain the formation of this terrain, as we saw earlier, by the fact that the mountains were ‘folded’ when the Indian landmass collided with Eurasia. This folded portion was part of an ocean, and so the rocks in this area Fig. 1.9. Yaks are very important for the lives of people in the Himalayas.

The desert acts as a natural barrier due to the harsh conditions that deter human and animal movement — including very high daytime temperatures and cold nights, as well as a lack of access to water. People living in the Thar have adapted their way of life to the place and what it offers; food habits, clothing and lifestyle are suited to these harsh conditions. Fig. 1.22.

The Aravallis play a vital role in shaping the geography and climate of northwestern India. One of its most important functions is acting as a natural barrier, preventing the Thar Desert from expanding further eastward. You will read more about this later. The Aravallis, rich in minerals like marble, granite, zinc, and copper, have supported mining and construction activities for centuries. In fact, evidence from its ancient mines at Zawar has shown that over eight centuries ago, Indians were the first in the world to master the delicate process of extraction of zinc. Historic forts, such as Chittorgarh, Kumbhalgarh, and Ranthambore, are located here. Fig. 1.25. (Left) A part of the Aravallis; just beyond this range, the Thar Desert begins.

India has several plateaus; the most important one is the triangular peninsular area in the middle and south of the country. It is also a very old land formation! Since this region is a peninsula, surrounded by water on all three sides by the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal, and the Indian Ocean, it is called a peninsular plateau.

The Western Ghats are taller and run along the western coast like a wall, with many beautiful waterfalls flowing down their steep sides during the monsoon season.

You reach for thick clothes to keep yourself warm. In the summer, you choose clothes that keep you cool and comfortable. You are responding to your body’s signals; your body is sensing the weather. What is weather? Weather is a state of the Earth’s atmosphere at a particular time and place. But what is an atmosphere? In simple terms, it is the layer of gases that surround some planets — in the case of our Earth, we call these gases ‘air’. The Earth’s atmosphere may be compared to a cake with several layers. The layer closest to the surface of the Earth is called the ‘troposphere’, and that is where all land-based plants and animals (including humans!) live and breathe. It is also where almost all weather phenomena, which we will explore in this chapter, take place. The troposphere extends to a height of 6 to 18 kilometres from the ground; it is less thick at the poles (where the cold air contracts) and thicker in the tropical zone (where the warmer air expands). You will study more about the other layers in your Science classes. We use many words to describe the weather — hot, cold, rainy, cloudy, humid, snowy, windy, and so on. They describe the different ways in which we experience the elements of weather. LET’S EXPLORE What are some of the words in your local language that you use to describe the weather?

THINK ABOUT IT Let us imagine that Krishnan from Chennai is speaking with Amir in Kashmir. Krishnan tells Amir that it has become chilly in Chennai after it rained the previous night. Amir asks him how cold it is. How will Krishnan explain to Amir how cold it is? After all, what is cold for Krishnan may be quite pleasant for Amir! As you can see, it would be difficult for Krishnan to convey his sense of chillness to Amir unless there is a commonly agreed way to measure the temperature. It is the same with other elements of the weather. In this chapter, we will learn how we measure the weather using common standards. LET’S EXPLORE What do you think could be some other reasons to measure the weather more precisely? (Hint: Think how knowing the weather a few hours or a few days in advance would help you plan some activities.) From early times, humans have closely observed Nature and learnt to read her signals to forecast the weather. Observing birds flying low, ants carrying eggs, squirrels gathering nuts, frogs croaking loudly, or even the opening and closing of pine cones, provided valuable information about coming rain or storms. This knowledge has been passed down from generation to generation. Even today, in many parts of India, people use traditional ways to predict the weather, especially the arrival of the monsoon. Water vapour: Water vapour is water in gaseous instead of liquid form. Sleet: Frozen or partly frozen rain. Hail: Small, hard balls of ice that fall from the sky like rain.

However, more and more, digital thermometers are preferred as they are more precise and can record more data. Indeed, temperature recordings can be used to collect some useful statistics, including:  Range of temperature or the maximum temperature minus the minimum temperature during a particular period of time (usually 24 hours).  Mean daily temperature or the maximum temperature plus the minimum temperature of the day divided by two.

For example, when the height of the water collected is 5 mm, we say that the area received 5 mm of rainfall. Fig. 2.6.

Calculate the average rainfall for every week in that month and comment on the variation from week to week. c) Atmospheric pressure Our bodies are quite aware of temperature and rainfall. But you may also have experienced that the weather sometimes feels ‘heavy’, as before a thunderstorm. This is related to atmospheric pressure, which is the pressure exerted by the weight of the air above and around us. The atmospheric pressure is higher near the sea coast and lower as we go higher up into the mountains. When you climb a mountain, the air gets thinner than in the plain below. As a result, the air pressure is lower, and there is less oxygen available for lower pressure (cooler air) higher pressure (warmer air) Fig. 2.7"}

With less oxygen getting into your blood, your body has to work harder to keep you moving! That’s why people sometimes feel breathless, dizzy or tired at high altitudes. This does not mean that the atmospheric pressure is always high in the plains below or on the coast. In fact, it sometimes drops dramatically, resulting in what meteorologists call a ‘depression’ or ‘low-pressure system’, which can sometimes develop into a storm or even a cyclone. THINK ABOUT IT Why do you think it would be important to measure atmospheric pressure? Who are the people most likely to use such measurements? The instrument used to measure atmospheric pressure is called a barometer. As with thermometers, there are several types of barometers. The unit they display is generally the millibar (abbreviated as mb). The normal atmospheric pressure at the sea coast is around 1013 mb; a pressure below 1000 mb indicates a depression. THINK ABOUT IT People who journey to places at a high altitude are advised to make pauses on the way to allow the body to acclimatise. Our army personnel serve in high-altitude places like Khardung la in Ladakh, which is over 5600 metres above sea level. It is hard to imagine how they live and work in places where the oxygen level is so low — the atmospheric pressure there is generally about 650 millibars!

Speed and direction are two important factors when we describe the wind. THINK ABOUT IT Have you seen seeds like these flying in the wind? What would happen to the seeds if there was no wind? The wind is an important element of the weather. Its direction and speed help in weather forecasting. Besides, air pilots and sailors need to be aware of wind data, as the wind has a great influence on flying or sailing. Farmers also use the wind direction to predict where rain might come from. Also, a greater wind speed will cause the soil to dry faster. So, how do we measure this direction and speed? A wind vane (or weather vane) has a rotating arm with a pointer at one end and a tail at the other. When the wind blows, the tail is pushed, and the pointer turns in the direction of the wind. It responds even to a light breeze. Fig. 2.9"}

Right: Anemometer This wind vane on the tarmac is called a ‘wind sock’. It gives pilots an indication of the direction of the wind during take-off and landing. Similar socks are used in industries that release ash or gases. The simplest instrument to measure the wind direction and speed is the anemometer. It has three or four metal cups that rotate on a vertical shaft when the wind blows — the stronger the wind, the faster the rotation. A meter attached at the bottom counts how many times the anemometer spins in a certain period of time and calculates the wind speed in kilometres per hour (km/h). e) Humidity Humidity is the last element of the weather on our list. It refers to the amount of water vapour present in the air. It also depends on factors like temperature, wind, pressure and location. LET’S EXPLORE Where do you think humidity is likely to be more, Kochi or Jaipur? You might guess that Kochi has higher humidity than Jaipur because it is located near the sea. But how will we know for sure? If we had to compare the humidity level between Kochi and Mangaluru, how would we do it? Discuss with your classmates."}

Before we move forward, we need to remember our Science lesson from Grade 6 about the states of water. This will help us to understand how humidity is measured. LET’S REMEMBER Æ When water evaporates, it causes a cooling effect. Æ If the amount of water in the air is already high (more humidity), water evaporates slowly. That is typically the case on a rainy day. Humidity of the air is measured as relative humidity: air that would contain absolutely no water vapour (which is impossible in natural conditions) is rated at 0%, while air saturated with water vapour will have a humidity of 100%. In practice, dry weather has a relative humidity range between 20% and 40%, while humid weather usually falls between 60% and 80% relative humidity. THINK ABOUT IT If the humidity in Delhi is at 52% while in Kochi it is 84%, in which of the two places are wet clothes likely to dry faster? And where are you likely to sweat more, assuming the temperature is the same in both places? But how do we measure such numbers? This is done through an instrument called a hygrometer. Again, there are several types of hygrometers, depending on the principle they are based on. The measurement of humidity is of great importance in many industrial processes, such as food processing. Museums also monitor humidity as they need to maintain a dry environment to preserve their exhibit."}

{"id": "class 7__sst__p68__c1", "text": "46 Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1 Weather, Seasons and the Climate ‘Climate’ is a word people use in everyday conversations. But, quite often, what they really mean is ‘weather’, and not ‘climate’. What’s the difference? ‘Weather’ is what we experience every hour or day: it might be raining, or there could be bright sunshine, a lot of wind, etc. The weather keeps changing. Climate, on the other hand, is the pattern of weather an area or a region experiences over a long period of time — several decades at least. This pattern varies from region to region. Before we come to the various types of climates, let us briefly stop to introduce seasons. Seasons occur as the Earth revolves around the Sun. Each season lasts for a few months and recurs every year. As we know, there are several seasons in the year — spring, summer, monsoon, autumn and winter — that occur in a cycle. Are seasons related to the weather or to the climate? The answer is: to both. The weather changes with the season, that is, it can be dry and hot in the summer months, or humid and rainy during the monsoon. Further, the pattern of seasons in a region is closely connected with the climate. There are four main seasons across most regions of the world — spring, summer, autumn and winter. However, India receives rainfall during a specific period of the year — the ‘rainy season’ or monsoon — along with the other four. Traditionally, in many parts of India, the year is divided into six seasons or ṛitus — vasanta (spring), grīṣhma (summer), varṣhā (rainy season), śharad (autumn), hemanta (pre-winter), śhiśhir (winter). Specific rituals and festivals are associated with these six ṛitus, such as Vasanta Pañchamī or Śharad Pūrṇima. Fig. 3.2"}
{"id": "class 7__sst__p69__c1", "text": "47 India and the World: Land and the People 3 – Climates of India If we observe the world around us, we will notice that human, plant and animal life are in rhythm with the ṛitus or seasons. The crops we grow, the food we eat, the clothes we wear, and so on, change with the season. Depending on the region, some trees and shrubs bloom with the onset of vasanta or spring, in some places they shed their leaves or change their colour as śharad or autumn approaches and some animals develop thick fur in the cold winter months. LET’S EXPLORE Æ Which are your favourite seasons? Write a short essay explaining your reasons. Æ Discuss in groups of three or four and find out whether there are specific events connected to the seasons in your region. Collect information about them — songs, feasts with specific types of food, practices in different seasons, etc. Document these and share your discoveries with your class. Æ Do you know which trees in your area change colours before the onset of winter? Are there trees that shed their leaves around this time? Why do you think this happens? Find out and document the local names of these trees. Usually, the climate remains stable over long periods of time. However, scientists have been recording changes in the climates of the world in the recent decades. Studies show that many of these changes have been caused by human actions. Let us recapitulate:  Weather is what we experience from day to day — windy, rainy, hot, dry, etc.  Seasons recur every year and the weather of a place is different in every season.  Climate is the long-term pattern in a particular region. There are many types of climates in the world. We will now survey the main types found in India."}
{"id": "class 7__sst__p70__c1", "text": "48 Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1 Types of Climates in India We have often seen how India is a land of diversity. This is equally true of its climate:  In the north, the Himalayan mountains have an alpine climate with cold, snowy winters and cool summers (the word ‘alpine’ comes from the Alps, a mountain range of Europe). That’s probably where you will see the thickest clothing in India!  Lower in the Himalayas, and in many hilly areas of India, the climate is often said to be temperate, as the winters are moderately cold and the summers not too hot. That is where we find many ‘hill stations’, much frequented by people seeking relief from the heat in the plains below.  In the northern plains, the climate is subtropical, with very hot summers and cold winters. This is where most of India’s wheat is grown.  In the west, the Thar Desert has an arid climate featuring extremely hot days, cool nights, and very little rainfall. People there have had to develop unique ways to collect and save water.  The western coastal strip receives heavy rainfall during monsoon months, creating a tropical wet climate, which is favourable to the growing of rice and spices.  The central Deccan Plateau has a semi-arid climate with hot summers, mild winters and moderate rainfall during the rainy season.  Eastern India and the southern peninsula experience a tropical climate with a mild winter and distinct wet and dry periods controlled by monsoon winds (more on them soon). Note: You will understand later the meaning of the terms ‘tropical’ and ‘subtropical’, which are related to two special parallels of latitude called the ‘tropics’. Fig. 3.3"}
{"id": "class 7__sst__p71__c1", "text": "49 India and the World: Land and the People 3 – Climates of India Factors Determining the Climate What creates those different climates? There are many factors at work. Some are general ones — on the scale of the planet — while others are regional or even local. Let’s examine a few. a) Latitude LET’S REMEMBER We studied about latitudes in Grade 6. Do you remember that latitudes measure the distance from the Equator, increasing as we move away from it (either northward or southward)? While the climate around the Equator is extremely hot, as the latitude increases it becomes temperate and then cold or frigid. Why is this so? Places near the Equator, that is, at low latitudes, are warmer, while those near the poles (high latitudes) are colder. This happens due to the angle at which the sun’s rays hit a particular area. At the Equator, the rays are nearly perpendicular, and so all their energy is focused on a smaller area of the Earth’s surface. In the polar regions, the rays are inclined or oblique, and the energy is distributed over a larger surface. Moreover, they have to pass through more of the Earth’s atmosphere, as the diagram shows, which further dissipates their energy. As a result, the polar regions receive less heat than the equatorial zone. We can see this in India too: Kanniyakumari and the Nicobar Islands being close to the Equator are warm or hot almost throughout the year, whereas places in the north, such as Srinagar, are much cooler. Solar radiation Atmosphere At the equator exposure to the sun’s rays is concentrated, but near the poles it is dispersed over a wide area Fig. 3.4"}
{"id": "class 7__sst__p72__c1", "text": "50 Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1 b) Altitude We mentioned hill stations above, which are popular tourist centres because of their cooler climate. India has many including Munnar, Theni, Udhagamandalam (Ooty), Madikeri, Mahabaleshwar, Mount Abu, Shimla, Nainital, Darjeeling, Tawang, Shillong, etc. We know they are located at a higher altitude than the plains below, but how does that explain their cooler temperature? You will later learn the full answer in your Science classes. To keep things simple for now, the temperature decreases as the altitude increases because: 1. The atmospheric pressure, and therefore the air density, decreases as the altitude increases (as we saw in the chapter ‘Understanding the Weather’), and as the air gets less dense, it gets cooler. 2. The sun heats the surface of the Earth, and so the farther away from the surface, the less hot the air will be. The Himalayas are so high that many peaks maintain a temperature below water’s freezing point, keeping them covered in snow. Udhagamandalam (Ooty) Shimla Darjeeling Munnar Fig. 3.5"}
{"id": "class 7__sst__p73__c1", "text": "51 India and the World: Land and the People 3 – Climates of India LET’S EXPLORE Udhagamandalam (Ooty) and Coimbatore are almost at the same latitude. The range of summer temperatures in Ooty is 10–25° while that in Coimbatore is 25 –38°. Why do you think there is such a difference in temperature between these two places? c) Proximity to the sea Temperatures in coastal areas do not vary much; the summers are not too hot and the winters are not too cold. That is because the sea acts as a moderator for the temperature. This diagram sums up the phenomenon, and your Science textbook explains this further while discussing the heating and cooling of land and water in coastal regions. The result is that those regions tend to be more temperate. As you move inland from the coast, the temperatures get more extreme — summer temperatures will be higher and winter temperatures lower. For instance, Mumbai and Nagpur are located at a similar latitude, but Mumbai, being near the sea, has cooler summers (around 32°C) and milder winters (around 18°C), while Nagpur, away from the coast, experiences up to 44°C in summer and about 10°C in winter. As you can see, Mumbai’s range of temperature (i.e. the difference between the maximum and the minimum) is about 14°C while the range at Nagpur reaches 34°C.

{"id": "class 7__sst__p74__c1", "text": "52 Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1 d) Winds Wind can move masses of warmer or cooler air. States like Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh often receive winds blowing from the west. Having travelled over the deserts of Arabia to Afghanistan, they bring dry and hot air that causes severe heat waves in summer. In winter cold winds from across the Himalayas creep into the Himalayan foothills, resulting in cold waves. Winds affect not only temperature, but also humidity, and in turn, precipitation. We saw dry winds coming from distant deserts; in contrast, winds coming from the sea bring moisture over the land, which may result in rainfall. We will soon see the case of the monsoon winds. LET’S REMEMBER In your Grade 6 Science textbook ‘Curiosity’ you studied the water cycle! “The water from the ocean and the Earth’s surface evaporates into the atmosphere as vapour and returns as rain, hail or snow….” e) Topography Finally, the topography of a region also plays an important role in determining its climate. For instance, the Himalayas and the Karakoram ranges protect, to some extent, the Indian Topography: The totality of the physical surface features of an area.

The nearly flat topography of the Thar desert, on the other hand, has nothing to protect it from hot and dry winds. In the next section, we will see the role of the Western Ghats in India’s southwest monsoon. Putting it all together... The climate of any region is determined collectively by all the above factors. Describing the climate involves a description of the patterns of temperature, precipitation (rain or snowfall, occurrence of fog or mist) and wind conditions in a region over three decades or more. A microclimate is a climate localised in a small area, which differs from the climate in the surrounding region. It has a unique pattern of temperature, humidity, precipitation, etc., in a small geographical area. For instance, enclosed valleys and some forests have micro- climates of their own. So do ‘urban heat islands’, that is, some cities that have a large number of buildings and other concrete structures and very little vegetation; all this traps the heat and they are often much warmer than the surrounding region. Microclimates can influence the local flora and fauna, the crops grown, and impact human health and well-being. Fig. 3.8. Aravallis and urban heat islands"}
{"id": "class 7__sst__p76__c1", "text": "54 Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1 The Monsoons The monsoon season is central to life in India. During the monsoon months, the rivers fill up, the soil is soaked with water, crops grow and life thrives. Strictly speaking, the word ‘monsoon’, which comes from the Arabic word mausim, meaning ‘season’, refers to seasonal winds over a large area of the Indian Ocean and surrounding regions, including Australia, Africa and South Asia. There is a yearly pattern to the monsoons. Their mechanism is complex, but based on the simple fact that land heats up or cools down faster than the ocean. Monsoons bring out the fundamental relationship between temperature, pressure and wind movement. To put it simply, as summer begins, the Asian landmass heats up, creating a powerful low-pressure system over it. Since air always flows from high pressure to low pressure, winds are drawn from the cooler, high-pressure ocean towards the hot land. These ocean winds carry moisture that condenses over the warmer land and falls in the form of heavy monsoon rains. (That is why ‘monsoon’ commonly refers to the seasonal rains rather than the winds.) Equator Africa Arabia southwest monsoon India Equator Africa Arabia northeast monsoon India B. Winter The pattern reverses in winter, when the landmass cools down more rapidly than the ocean. Now the land has a high-pressure system while the ocean remains warmer with relatively lower pressure. This causes the winds to blow in the opposite direction — from the land towards the ocean — bringing dry conditions to much of Asia. Fig. 3.9 A. Summer"}
{"id": "class 7__sst__p77__c1", "text": "55 India and the World: Land and the People 3 – Climates of India Coming to India, the monsoon rains typically advance from the southern tip of India in early June, moving northward over several weeks until they cover the entire subcontinent by mid- July. It is not a smooth progression, though the Western Ghats (remember our brief survey of topography) act as a natural barrier; their western slopes receive much rainfall, while the Deccan plateau to the east receive less, and often with interruptions. This is commonly called the summer or southwest monsoon (‘southwest’ reflecting the direction the winds come from). As winter approaches, the winds reverse and blow from the land to the ocean, as we just saw. These are dry winds that bring cold weather to south India, but a part of them, passing over the Bay of Bengal, collect some moisture and bring rainfall to parts of east and south India. This is called the winter or northeast monsoon. DON’T MISS OUT Æ Mawsynram, located in Meghalaya, receives the highest average annual rainfall in the world, about 11,000 mm (which is the same as 11 metres!). Æ The monsoons have inspired many ragās in both Carnatic and Hindustani classical music. Meghamalhār and amruthavarshini are names of a couple of them. Fig. 3.10."}
{"id": "class 7__sst__p78__c1", "text": "56 Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1 LET’S EXPLORE Since the ability to predict the monsoon rainfall has been an important aspect of life in India, our ancestors observed Nature around them carefully. They developed local traditional knowledge through their experience. This traditional knowledge is an important heritage we must preserve. For example, fishermen on the Konkan coast predict the onset of the monsoon when fishes that normally stay under water are seen at the surface; in parts of southern India monsoon is said to arrive within 50 days after the Golden Shower tree (Cassia fistula) blossoms. Some communities also believe that when crows build their nests high on tree-tops, it indicates less rainfall, whereas if the nests are lower, rainfall is likely to be heavy. Make a list of such local knowledge about rain, fog, snow or hail in your area. Climate and our Lives Our lives are deeply connected with the climate and dependent on it. The impact of climate is visible in local cultures for instance, and India has many festivals associated with seasons and agricultural activities.

Industrial activity also often depends on a predictable weather and the availability of water. The world over, we can easily detect such connections between the climate and socioeconomic conditions. Those conditions get especially strained when climate disasters strike. Climates and Disasters India’s diverse weather patterns can bring about extreme conditions such as cyclones, floods, landslides and other such climate-related disasters. These events affect people’s lives, disrupt agriculture, damage infrastructure and disturb local economies. a) Cyclones Every year, the Indian coastline, especially the eastern coast, witness several cyclones. In past years, some of them have been highly destructive, resulting in the loss of human and animal life, damaging property and infrastructure, uprooting trees and causing soil erosion. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) keeps track of coming cyclones and provides information on their formation, evolution, place of landing, etc. DON’T MISS OUT The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) is specially trained to respond to natural as well as human-made disasters.

{"id": "class 7__sst__p81__c1", "text": "59 India and the World: Land and the People 3 – Climates of India How are cyclones formed? We saw that in some special situations, the atmospheric pressure near the sea becomes lower than the surrounding areas, creating a low-pressure system. This is an invitation to the air from surrounding areas to come into the low-pressure area, and the air from the sea moves in, bringing with it moisture and rain. When the low- pressure system is intense and the wind speeds are high, this may result in a cyclone. As winds collect moisture, they form clouds and rotate inwards towards the centre of the depression. This centre, which is cloudless, is called ‘the eye of the cyclone’. THINK ABOUT IT What are clouds? White lumps in the sky, you might say. But what are they made of? The answer is simple — water. But not just any water; clouds are masses of water droplets, ice crystals, or a mixture of both, that are suspended in the atmosphere. clouds formed low pressure centre winds bringing moist air from sea Fig. 3.13.

This could be due to heavy rainfall generating huge run-off water that the land cannot absorb, or due to excessive accumulation of water in bodies like rivers and lakes, until the water overflows or their banks are breached. Floods occur frequently during the monsoons. States such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Assam are particularly vulnerable to floods. LET’S EXPLORE Have you seen or read about floods? Look at the physical map of India. Discuss in pairs why you think floods occur in the areas mentioned above. In the Himalayan regions, on the other hand, floods occur when glacial lakes overflow. Glacial lakes form a barrier of rocks and ice to hold their water, which often comes from melting glaciers.

Altogether about 6,000 people, many of them pilgrims, lost their lives. Many cities experience flooding when there is heavy rainfall. This may be due to an overburdened drainage system or poorly planned construction encroaching on the waterways and blocking the flow of water. Besides, urban surfaces of concrete or asphalt do not allow water to be absorbed by the earth. Landslide Flood Cyclone Forest Fire Fig. 3.15"}
{"id": "class 7__sst__p84__c1", "text": "62 Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1 c) Landslides A landslide is the sudden collapse of rock, soil, or debris, often triggered by heavy rain, earthquakes or volcanic activity. Landslides are common in hilly and mountainous regions such as Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh, as well as the Western Ghats and hilly regions. These events often occur during the monsoon. In those regions, the chances of landslides have increased due to human activities such as the cutting down of forests, building infrastructure without following approved methods and the construction of too many buildings that block the natural flow of water. d) Forest fires Forest fires are uncontrolled fires that spread rapidly across vegetation, often fuelled by dry climatic conditions, droughts or high winds. Human carelessness is another frequent cause. Forest fires are common in states with large forested or grassland areas such as Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, as well as mountain ranges such as the Western Ghats. Apart from destroying large areas of forest, fires harm wildlife, degrade the ecosystem, spoil the air quality and displace local communities. The consequences are therefore both environmental and economic. LET’S EXPLORE Æ Observe Fig. 3.15. Describe the effects they may have on people, plants, animals and economic life.

This may be on the scale of the planet or on a regional scale, and it involves shifts in temperature, precipitation and weather events. In past millennia (we can go back millions of years, in fact), natural processes drove climate change. Since the 19th century, however, climate change has been largely driven by human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, environmentally harmful industrial practices, and production and patterns of excessive or wasteful consumption. Fossil fuels: Sources of energy that were formed from the remains of plants and animals that died millions of years ago and were buried deep under layers of soil and rock or under the sea, where heat and pressure slowly turned them into coal, petroleum oil and natural gas.

{"id": "class 7__sst__p86__c1", "text": "64 Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1 Why does the burning of fossil fuels affect the climate? In the Earth’s natural carbon cycle, carbon dioxide (CO2) and other gases are released gradually into the atmosphere and trap heat from the Sun. This natural ‘greenhouse effect’ warms Earth enough to support life. However, human activities like industry, transportation, and agriculture have released enormous amounts of these ‘greenhouse gases’ in just a few centuries. This sudden increase traps extra heat, causing rapid global warming and disrupting the climate patterns that plants, animals, and human societies have adapted to over thousands of years. In India, rising temperatures are perceptible in many regions. Early in 2025, for instance, the country’s average temperature was 1 to 3°C above normal, as a result of which the winter was much shorter and milder than usual. This affects not only agricultural production but also many small-scale industries. This is only one example showing how a warmer planet will present us with increasing challenges. Understanding the relationship between the causes of climate change and disasters can help us to prepare better for these challenges. It also supports the need for more environment- friendly practices and building resilience and adaptation in communities. Governments worldwide, including India’s, attempt to promote measures of climate mitigation, such as cutting down on greenhouse gas emissions, planting trees, boosting renewable energy and improving energy efficiency, promoting sustainable lifestyles, etc. But these often clash with a desire for economic growth and increased consumption.

And for a whole millennium, urban life remained absent from India, though there may have been a few towns here and there in north India. Fig. 4.2. The fertile Gangetic plains helped the mahājanapadas to grow and prosper."}
{"id": "class 7__sst__p91__c1", "text": "69 Tapestry of the Past 4 – New Beginnings: Cities and States Indeed, there were important regional cultures, which we need not study here. Then, in the 1st millennium BCE, a vibrant new phase of urbanisation began in the Ganga plains, parts of the Indus (or Sindhu) basin and neighbouring regions, gradually spreading to other parts of the Subcontinent. How do we know this? Mainly from two sources: (1) archaeological excavations that have confirmed the existence of those ancient urban centres, and (2) ancient literature describing them — late Vedic, Buddhist and Jain literatures are full of references to these new urban centres. This new phase is often called India’s ‘Second Urbanisation’ — which, incidentally, has continued right up to today! Let us see how this phase emerged. Janapadas and Mahājanapadas Towards the end of the 2nd millennium BCE, regional cultures gradually reorganised themselves in north India. As people formed clans or groups, probably sharing a common language and common customs, each clan came to be associated with a territory or janapada led by a rājā or ruler. (‘Janapada’ is a Sanskrit word which means ‘where the people (jana) have set foot (pada),’ that is, have settled down.) The janapadas grew as trade networks expanded and connected them. By the 8th or 7th centuries BCE, some of those early states had merged together; the resulting bigger units were known as mahājanapadas. Although the texts have different lists of them, the more frequent list gives the names of 16 mahājanapadas, extending from Gandhāra in the northwest to Anga in the east and to Aśhmaka in central India, close to the Godavari River (see map). There may have been a few more, along with some smaller janapadas continuing independently."}
{"id": "class 7__sst__p92__c1", "text": "70 Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1 THINK ABOUT IT Notice how many of the mahājanapadas are concentrated in the Ganga plains. There are several possible reasons for this, including the growth of agriculture in the fertile Ganga plains, the availability of iron ore in the mountains and hills (see below about iron), and the formation of new trade networks. LET’S EXPLORE Æ The most powerful of these new states were Magadha, Kosala, Vatsa and Avanti. Looking at the map, can you identify their capitals? Also, how many can you match with Indian cities of today? Æ Compare this map with the map of the regions mentioned in the Mahābhārata (see Fig. 5.4 in the chapter ‘India, That Is Bharat’ in Grade 6) and list the names common to both maps. What do you think this implies? The map (Fig. 4.3) shows the mahājanapadas’ capitals. Most were fairly large well-fortified cities, with a moat running outside the fortifications as further defence. Often, the gateways through the rampart walls would be deliberately kept narrow, so guards may control the movement of people and goods entering or leaving the city. It is fascinating to note that most of those ancient capitals continue to be living cities today — ‘modern’ cities that are often 2,500 years old! Early Democratic Traditions Each janapada had an assembly or council, called sabhā or samiti, where matters concerning the clan would be discussed. (Remember, from the chapter on ‘India’s Cultural Roots’, that the words sabhā and samiti first appear in the Vedas, India’s most ancient texts.) We may assume that most of the members were elders in the clan. The rājā was not expected to rule independently or arbitrarily; Moat: A deep, wide ditch surrounding a fort or a fortified city and filled with water."}

Indeed, according to some texts, an incompetent ruler could be removed by the assembly. Of course, while such mentions are significant, it does not mean that this was an established law; let us remember that the data we have for such remote periods is incomplete. In their political systems, the mahājanapadas expanded the basic principles of the janapadas. Some were, in effect, monarchies, in the sense that the rājā was the ultimate authority, supported by ministers and an assembly of Fig. 4.3. Map of the sixteen mahājanapadas.

His position was hereditary, in the sense that a rājā would usually be the son of the previous one. The king would collect taxes or revenue, maintain law and order, get impressive fortifications built around their capital, and maintain an army to defend the territory or wage war with neighbouring ones, as the case may be. Magadha (located in part of today’s Bihar), Kosala (in part of today’s Uttar Pradesh) and Avanti (in part of today’s Madhya Pradesh) were among the most powerful such states. However, at least two mahājanapadas, Vajji (or Vṛijji) and the neighbouring Malla, had a different system: the sabhā or samiti had more power and took important decisions through discussion, and, if necessary, through vote. Surprisingly, this included the selection of the rājā! This means that those mahājanapadas, which were called gaṇas or sanghas, were not monarchies — their functioning might be called democratic, since members of the assembly were the ones to select the ruler and take major decisions.

More Innovations The age of the janapadas and mahājanapadas was an age of profound change, which would impact Indian civilisation until present times. In the chapter ‘India’s Cultural Roots’ in Grade 6, we saw the emergence of several new schools of thought — late Vedic, Buddhist, Jain in particular, and their respective literatures. Those schools disseminated their teachings and literature through scholars, monks and nuns travelling across India or people undertaking pilgrimages. Indian art also underwent a renewal; it will blossom in the age of empires. Urbanisation does not happen without technologies. Let us remember that the Harappan civilisation mastered copper and bronze metallurgy. Now, in this Second Urbanisation, a major shift in technology involved iron metallurgy. In several regions of India, the techniques of extracting and shaping iron were actually perfected from the early 2nd millennium BCE, but it took a few centuries for iron to become a part of daily life. By the late 2nd millennium BCE, iron tools had become widespread, facilitating agriculture on a bigger scale. Iron also made better weapons than bronze, lighter and sharper — swords, spears, arrows, shields, etc. As it happens, there is some evidence of warfare between neighbouring mahājanapadas — how frequent or how intense it was, of course, is impossible to tell. Such military campaigns, but occasionally alliances too, gave rise to new kingdoms and empires, which we will turn to later in our journey. Another innovation was the first use of coins in India, made necessary by growing trade. Very soon, coins were exchanged across different regions and even with other parts of the world. The first Indian coins were made of"}
{"id": "class 7__sst__p96__c1", "text": "74 Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1 silver, a soft metal into which symbols could be ‘punched’; they are called ‘punch-marked coins’.

The Varṇa–Jāti System We saw earlier how human societies grew more complex with the rise of civilisation.

Think about several possible factors why this happens. Æ List other such professions you expect in a complex society of the 1st millennium BCE. In an ideal society, all those groups would complement each other and work in harmony. But most of the time, these divisions also lead to inequalities: some groups acquire more wealth, power or influence than others. In other words, while equality is an ideal that human societies have often aspired to, very few, if any, have ever achieved it. In India, the society was organised in a two-fold system. One category was the jāti, a group or community of people with a specific professional occupation closely tied to their livelihood. The skills that defined a particular jāti — for instance, skill in agriculture, metallurgy, commerce or any craft — was generally transmitted from generation to generation. Often, a jāti would get further subdivided into sub-jātis, each of which developed customs and traditions of its own, for instance concerning marriage, rituals or food habits. Along with the jāti, there is another category, that of varṇa, a concept that emerged from Vedic texts. There were four varṇas: Brahmins were engaged in preserving and spreading knowledge, and in the performance of rituals; Kshatriyas were expected to defend the society and the land, and to engage in warfare if necessary; Vaishyas were supposed to increase the society’s wealth through occupations of trade, business or agriculture; finally, Shudras were the artisans, craftspeople, workers or servants."}
{"id": "class 7__sst__p99__c1", "text": "77 Tapestry of the Past 4 – New Beginnings: Cities and States DON’T MISS OUT You may have heard the English word ‘caste’. It comes from a Portuguese word, casta, as Portuguese travellers to India in the 16th century CE tried to make sense of Indian society. While a few scholars consider ‘caste’ to refer to varṇas, most take it to apply to jātis; yet others consider ‘caste’ to refer to the whole varṇa–jāti system. There is historical evidence, both in texts and inscriptions, that in the early period individuals and communities changed their professional occupations if circumstances demanded. For instance, a long drought or some natural calamity could force a community of farmers to migrate to a city and take up other occupations, or some Brahmins would turn to trade or even military activities. This complex system structured Indian society, organised its activities, including economic ones, and therefore gave it some stability. In time, however, the system became rigid and led to inequalities and discrimination towards the lower jātis or some communities excluded from the varṇa-jāti system. This process will be studied in a higher grade. The varṇa-jāti system has had a deep impact on Indian society, and generations of scholars have studied its countless aspects. There is a broad agreement that the system was significantly different (more flexible, in particular) in earlier periods and became more rigid with the passage of time, in particular during the British rule in India. Let us also keep in mind that while varṇa-jāti has been an important mechanism at work in Indian society, it is not the only one; there have been many others, some of which we will explore later, especially in the theme ‘Our Cultural Heritage and Knowledge Traditions’."}

Developments Elsewhere in India In this 1st millennium BCE, important communication routes opened up for purposes of trade, pilgrimage, military campaigns, etc. Two routes became widely used and are often mentioned in the literature: the Uttarapatha and the Dakṣhiṇapatha.

His authority extends over many villages, towns and kingdoms. My uncle told me that it takes close to two months on horseback to reach the borders of the territory!” “That sounds bigger than just a kingdom… What do you call it?” “It is called an Empire,” Ira stated with evident pride. What is an Empire? The word ‘empire’ comes from the Latin ‘imperium’, which means ‘supreme power’. Simply put, an empire is a collection of smaller kingdoms or territories over which a powerful ruler or group of rulers exert power, often after waging war against the smaller kingdoms. The smaller territories still had their own rulers, but they were all tributaries to the emperor, who ruled the whole territory from a capital, usually a major centre of economic and administrative power. In ancient Sanskrit texts, words commonly used for ‘emperor’ made this clear; they included samrāj, meaning ‘the lord of all’ or ‘supreme ruler’; adhirāja or ‘overlord’; and rājādhirāja or ‘king of kings’. Tributary: A tributary, in our case, is a ruler or a state that has submitted to an emperor and pays tribute— that is, money, gold (or other precious metals), grain, livestock, elephants or other valuable goods produced in their kingdom and is given to the emperor as a sign of submission, loyalty or respect. A synonym for ‘tributary’ is ‘vassal’, and another way to express this is to say that the tributary or vassal kingdoms accepted the emperor’s overlordship."}

Pen your ideas and share them with your class. Trade , trade routes and guilds Conducting military campaigns, especially in distant lands, is not as simple as it might seem. Maintaining an army is a costly affair: soldiers need to be fed, clothed, equipped with weapons, and paid; elephants and horses need to be cared for; roads or ships have to be built, and so on. All this requires considerable economic power, control over the workforce, and access to resources. We can now understand that economic activity — especially production and trade — is one of the keys to maintaining an empire and ensuring people’s welfare and quality of life, which a good ruler should be concerned with. Therefore, establishing and controlling trade routes all over the empire’s territory and beyond is of great importance. That way, the goods traded will grow in quantity and variety, and more trade means more income for the producers and increased tax collections for the ruler. Returning to the case of ancient India, what would have been the traded goods? There is plenty of evidence on this, at least, both from the literature and archaeological excavations — textiles, spices, agricultural produce, luxury items such as gems and handicraft products, and various animals were among the main items of trade. All this brisk trade was not limited to India; many Indian goods travelled towards distant countries by land or sea. More often than not, traders were not just isolated individuals carrying out their own business. They soon understood the benefits of joining forces and creating guilds (śhrenīs).

Second, as an ancient text put it, “Cultivators, traders, herdsmen, moneylenders, and artisans have authority to lay down rules for their respective classes”; in other words, guilds had the autonomy to create their own internal rules, and the king was not to interfere with them (and why should he, if trade flourished?). Guilds spread over large parts of India and endured for centuries. Even after they ceased to exist formally, their spirit continued to influence India’s trade and business activities, sometimes even to this day. The institution of guilds provides an excellent example of the self-organising abilities of Indian society. The ancient village unit, with its various committees and councils, provides another.

Around the 5th century BCE, Mahāpadma Nanda rose to prominence in Magadha and founded the Nanda dynasty. He successfully unified many smaller kingdoms and extended his empire across parts of eastern and northern India. As the economy thrived, he began issuing coins, demonstrating his economic power. We also learn from Greek accounts that the Nanda dynasty maintained a large army. From various accounts of the Nanda dynasty, it appears that its last emperor, Dhana Nanda, though very rich, became highly unpopular as he oppressed and exploited his people. This paved the way for the Nanda empire to be conquered and absorbed into what would become one of the largest empires India ever knew — the Maurya empire.

Among them, according to Greek accounts, were the Pauravas, led by their king, Porus. 334–331 BCE: Alexander, a young and powerful Greek king from Macedonia, campaigned against the Persian Empire to avenge earlier Persian invasions of Greece (during which some Indian soldiers from the Persian-ruled northwest of India fought against Greeks!).

Enact a play of this battle scene using your imagination in addition to what you have discovered. 327–325 BCE 324–323 BCE Eager to reach the “end of the world”, Alexander pushed on further east and brought his campaign to India, defeated Porus in Punjab and, encountering fierce resistance from local tribes and rulers, massacred the population of several cities. Greek records mention that in a few battles, “women fought side by side with their men.” Alexander himself was seriously wounded in a battle. Tired and homesick, his soldiers lost the will to fight and refused to move deeper into India, towards the Ganga River. Alexander and part of his army retreated to Persia, but through the coastal route in the south and Iran’s harsh desert regions, resulting in heavy losses to his troops out of thirst, hunger and disease. Back in Persia, Alexander faced rebellions and political turmoil. After he fell ill and died in Babylon at the age of 32, his immense empire was soon divided between his generals and the satraps, who created their own kingdoms."}

Alexander challenged them with tricky questions in the form of riddles, warning that he would put those who gave wrong answers to death. However, the Gymnosophists responded to his questions calmly and intelligently. Alexander was impressed and, in the end, spared them all. Over the centuries, different versions of this story have been told, making it one of the most fascinating encounters in history! According to one account, Alexander asked, “Which is stronger, life or death?” One of the sages replied, “Life, because it endures while death does not.” Alexander then asked, “How can a man be most loved?” “If he is most powerful and yet does not inspire fear,” came the reply, perhaps as a hint to the mighty ruler! Historians view such exchanges as a meeting of two great traditions — Greek and Indian philosophies. The Mighty Mauryas After that brief sojourn to the northwest, let us return to Magadha, where we witnessed the decline of the Nanda empire. Around 321 BCE, just a few years after Alexander left India with his army, a new dynasty and new empire emerged: the Maurya Empire founded by Chandragupta Maurya. It quickly absorbed the Nanda empire’s territories and went on expanding beyond. As per many accounts, Chandragupta managed this feat with the help of an able mentor named Kauṭilya, who used his knowledge of politics, governance and economics to create an empire that remains one of the greatest in Indian history.

At the beginning of his reign, Aśhoka was quite ambitious. He had inherited a vast empire but further expanded it to cover almost the entirety of the Indian subcontinent, except for the southernmost region, but including present-day Bangladesh and Pakistan and parts of present-day Afghanistan. One encounter, however, is said to have changed the path of his life. According to one of his edicts he once marched on Kalinga (modern-day Odisha), where he waged a ferocious war. Seeing the enormous amount of death and destruction on the battlefield, Aśhoka chose to give up violence and, to the greatest extent possible, adopt the path of peace and non-violence that the Buddha taught. THINK ABOUT IT Aśhoka, in his edicts, tells the story of the Kalinga war. He could have chosen not to mention it and maintain his image as a peaceful, benevolent king for future generations. Why do you think he admitted to this destructive war? Embracing Buddhist teachings, Aśhoka sent emissaries to Sri Lanka, Thailand, Central Asia and beyond to spread the message of the Buddha far and wide. Fig. 5.16.

At a deeper level, however, dharma extends to living according to the order of the universe or ṛitam. This includes doing one’s duty truthfully, following rules of righteous conduct and leading a life in harmony with the cosmic order.

Bhavisha and Dhruv will join us on this journey in the next chapter. Life in the Mauryan period Cities like Pāṭaliputra were bustling centres of governance and commerce. They had palaces, public buildings, and well-planned streets. With a well-organised taxation system and brisk trade, the treasury remained strong, fuelling the empire’s growth and prosperity.

The houses were made of wood and could be up to two storeys tall. The streets had vessels of water stored at regular intervals in case of fire.

This could happen if, for example, the emperor needed more resources for long military campaigns or in times of drought; local rulers would be burdened with increasing demands for tribute, leading to resentment. Or if a powerful emperor was followed by one perceived to be weak, local kings or chieftains might simply decide to take a chance and stop paying tribute. Also, the larger an empire, the more difficult it is to hold it together, as Alexander experienced; far-off territories are often the first to split away from the empire. Finally, economic crises caused by natural calamities (such as a long drought or floods) could also shake an empire’s structure. Empires are, therefore, something of a paradox. On the one hand, they can bring about political unity, as the Mauryan empire did to almost the entire Subcontinent, and reduce or eliminate warfare among the smaller kingdoms — indeed, a well-managed empire could lead to greater prosperity than smaller, warring kingdoms.

Here we go… Very little is known about Aśhoka’s successors to the throne. It is generally accepted, however, that the last Maurya emperor was assassinated around 185 BCE by his commander- in-chief Puṣhyamitra Śhunga. This led to a breakup of the empire — hardly half a century after Aśhoka, as we mentioned in the last chapter. Many new kingdoms emerged across the subcontinent, which, often, were earlier tributary kingdoms under the overlordship of the Maurya empire. The northwest region became weak, exposing it to invasions from outside the subcontinent.

Above is a map of the post-Maurya period. How many kingdoms can you count in the area that were previously under the control of the Maurya empire? The ‘new’ kingdoms now competed for territorial control. Peaceful methods like matrimonial alliances between neighbour- ing kingdoms, or the use of force in warfare, were means of gaining control. Remember that there was constant wrestling for control over areas along the borders, as gaining control over them was important to keep the kingdom safe from attacks. Together with those political events, there was a burst in the development of art, architecture and literature, and enriching cultural exchanges.

He performed the aśhvamedha yajña, a Vedic ritual, to establish himself as a most powerful ruler. Although his empire was smaller than the previous Maurya Empire (compare their two maps), he kept it safe from potential invaders and maintained friendly relations with the Greeks, after some initial military campaign against them. But, again, the empire did not last long after him — a century later, it was gone. The period witnessed the revival of Vedic rituals and practices, but other schools of thought nevertheless continued to flourish. DON’T MISS OUT The aśhvamedha yajña was a Vedic ritual conducted by many rulers to declare their position as the king. In this ritual, a horse accompanied by soldiers was left to wander freely. Any territory that the horse crossed unchallenged was considered to become a part of the king’s empire. If any ruler stopped the horse, it led to a battle to determine supremacy. Fig. 6.4.

Tolls and taxes on trade added revenue to the kingdom. Economic prosperity and a relatively peaceful political period facilitated the development of literature, art and culture, to which the Sātavāhanas made significant contributions. Fig. 6.9.

Do you remember the Kalinga war mentioned in the previous chapter? After the decline of the Maurya Empire, Kalinga rose as a prominent power under the kings of the Chedi dynasty. Khāravela, one of their main rulers, was a devoted follower of Jain teachings; he was sometimes called bhikṣhu-rāja or monk-king, although he respected all schools of thoughts. Near Bhubaneswar, the famous Udayagiri-Khandagiri caves, likely developed for Jain monks, feature intricate panels and statues, and spacious rooms carved into the rock, showcasing the skill of the craftsmen.

Khāravela also proudly declares that he created a ‘council of ascetics and sages’ from a hundred regions and is ‘accomplished in extraordinary virtues, respector of every sect and repairer of every temple’. Once again, a ruler takes pride in extending his protection to all schools of thought. This is a fundamental part of what we may call the ‘Indian ethos’.

Picture yourself as a sculptor in that era, shaping stone into art with your own hands. What tools would you use? Kingdoms and Life in the South In India’s southern region, this period, between the 2nd or 3rd century BCE and the 3rd century CE, saw the rise to prominence of three powerful kingdoms — the Cheras, the Cholas and the Pānḍyas — which often competed with each other for control over the South, while also contributing to the region’s growth in trade and culture. Let’s remember how Aśhoka’s empire stopped at those south Indian kingdoms (which he mentions in his edicts), which suggests that they remained independent even at the height of Mauryan power. And although Khāravela claims that he defeated an alliance of south Indian kings that threatened his own territory, the location of that battle is unknown and he does not seem to have invaded the southern region.

The word sangam is derived from the Sanskrit sangha, which translates to ‘association’ and ‘coming together’ — in this context, referring to an assembly of the poets. The Sangam literature, the oldest in south India, consists of several collections or anthologies of poems and is much consulted by historians who investigate the society and culture of the times. Primarily, Sangam poetry expresses with great skill and delicacy personal emotions such as love or societal values like heroism and generosity. The Cholas The Sangams refer to three ‘crowned kings’ — the Cholas, Cheras and Pānḍyas. The Cholas were a powerful dynasty that ruled parts of south India from the 3rd century BCE to the 13th century CE. The Chola king Karikāla is said to have defeated a combined force of the Cheras and Pānḍyas and established his supremacy. Fig. 6.14.

However, Kovalan fell in love with a dancer and eventually lost all his wealth over her. Realising his mistake, he returned to Kaṇṇagi, who forgave him. They then travelled to Madurai, the capital of the Pānḍya kingdom, hoping to rebuild their lives. To start anew, Kaṇṇagi gave Kovalan one of her anklets to sell; however, he was falsely accused of theft and executed by the Pānḍya king. Devastated, Kaṇṇagi proved his innocence by revealing her second anklet. The king, realising his mistake, died of shock. Kaṇṇagi then cursed Madurai, invoking the god of fire who destroyed the city. She then walked further west to the Chera kingdom, where she was honoured as a goddess. Even today, Kaṇṇagi is worshipped in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Silappadikāram’s exquisite poetry thus centres on the principles of justice and the ruler’s dharma to protect it.

They played an essential role in shaping the region’s cultural and economic history, encouraging the growth of Tamil literature and patronising Sangam poets. The Cheras were known for their extensive trade connections with the Roman Empire and West Asia, exporting many goods from India to the outside world. The kingdom became a hub for the export of spices, timber, ivory and pearls. THINK ABOUT IT Have you ever wondered how historians uncover the trade relations between two distant kingdoms many centuries ago? Let’s take a moment to brainstorm and discuss how this information comes to light. The Chera kings issued a number of coins under their reign. Do you notice the royal emblem of Cheras on one such coin given below? The Pānḍyas The Pānḍyas’ rule over parts of Tamil Nadu and the surrounding regions, with their capital at present-day Madurai, goes back several centuries BCE. Successive kings expanded the Pāndyan kingdom. In his work Indika, Megasthenes mentions this kingdom as a prosperous one, with a strong administration and involved in active trade with distant powers like the Greeks and Romans, apart from much internal trade (Khāravela, for instance, states that he gets hundreds of pearls brought from the Pānḍya kingdom). The Pānḍyas were also an important naval power of the subcontinent. The later Pānḍyas also contributed greatly to the art, architecture, and overall prosperity of the region. Fig. 6.18.

Invasions of the Indo-Greeks Having completed our brief journey into south India, it is time to return to the north, where a very different kind of development is about to occur. So far, we have only visited a few native dynasties; yet the same period also witnessed the arrival of invaders who entered through the northwest frontier and took control of the northwestern, northern, and central regions of the Subcontinent. Let us first examine the legacy of Alexander’s brief campaign in the Indus plains. While retreating from the areas he had conquered, he left satraps behind. Over time, these regional rulers established their independent domains and came to be known as ‘Indo-Greeks’. After the decline of the Mauryas, the areas in the northwestern regions (roughly present-day Pakistan and Afghanistan) were an easy target for the Indo-Greeks. However, while they arrived as conquerors, they were much influenced by the rich local culture. This cultural interaction led to a blend of Greek and Indian elements in governance, art, language, and daily life, shaping the cultural landscape of the region. The Heliodorus pillar, near Vidisha (Madhya Pradesh), is a notable example of such connections. It is named after an Indo- Fig. 6.19. The Heliodorus pillar near Vidisha"}

The inscription also states, “Three immortal precepts (footsteps) [...] when practised lead to heaven: self- restraint, charity, consciousness.” During excavations in north India, archaeologists have found many Indo-Greeks coins, which have provided most of the information we have about these rulers. Those coins were made of gold, silver, copper and nickel often portraying a king on one side and Greek deities on the other. However, some coins, instead, depicted Indian deities like Vāsudeva-Kṛiṣhṇa and Lakṣhmī. The rule of the Indo-Greeks ended with the invasions of the Indo-Scythians or Śhakas (see a little below). LET’S EXPLORE What do you think might have been the meaning of having deities like Vāsudeva-Kṛiṣhṇa or Lakṣhmī on some Indo-Greek coins? DON’T MISS OUT The Śhakas (sometimes called Indo-Scythians) also invaded the northwest of the Subcontinent and ruled from the latter part of the 2nd century BCE to the 5th century CE. Their kingdoms rose to power after the Indo-Greeks, and they were in power until the arrival of the Kuṣhāṇas (see below). It was during this period that the Śhaka Samvat calendar was developed. It is 78 years behind the Gregorian calendar (except from January–March, when it is behind by 79 years). It was adopted as the Indian National Calendar in 1957. Fig. 6.20.

What does it say about his values and priorities?  Can you find modern examples of such symbolic currency? The Kuṣhāṇas held control over significant sections of the Silk Route (on the next page), and during their reign, trade grew, connecting India with other parts of Asia and the West. Continuing the trend set under the Indo-Greek rulers, Kuṣhāṇa art and architecture, exemplified by the Gāndhāra and Mathurā schools of art, are celebrated for their fusion of Indian and Greek styles. The sculptures feature a variety of deities reflecting the peaceful co-existence of various schools of thought. This era saw the rise of representations of deities — like Sūrya or the sun god — which looked more similar to humans and the increase in the development of religious art, laying the groundwork for later temple architecture in the subcontinent. The Gāndhāra style, which emerged in the western regions of Punjab, blended Greco- Roman elements with Indian features. Most sculptures and artefacts from this tradition were crafted in intricate detail from grey- black schist stone. In particular, sculptors produced many fine Buddha images with realistic anatomy and flowing robes. THINK ABOUT IT Do you know where Gāndhāra is?

A New Power Emerges By the 3rd century CE, the Kuṣhāṇa Empire, which spread over the north and northwest of the Subcontinent, started to weaken. New kingdoms emerged, setting the stage for a fresh period of consolidation, and the new actor on this stage was the Gupta dynasty. There are various theories on the origin of the Guptas. However, it is widely believed that they emerged in a region near present- day Uttar Pradesh as regional rulers. Over time, they rose to prominence and established a powerful empire. The Gupta period is considered remarkable in Indian history and is marked by significant developments in many areas. The fields of art, architecture, literature and science flourished, particularly during the time of Chandragupta II, and that legacy continues even today."}

Faxian travelled extensively across India, observing her culture, governance and society, and recorded his experiences and observations for the people of his homeland — and for us too — since his travelogue has survived to this day! Below is an excerpt from his travelogue, where he records his observations of the society in the Gupta era. The people are numerous and happy […] they have no need to register households or attend to officials. […] Those who farm royal land pay a portion of their grain. […] The king’s guards and attendants have salaries […] The cities are the greatest in the Middle Kingdom [i.e. the Gangetic plains], and the inhabitants are rich, prosperous, and practice kindness and righteousness. Heads of Vaishya families [i.e. merchants or traders] establish houses for charity and medicines […] the poor, orphans and the sick are cared for […] doctors provide treatment, and the needy receive food and medicines. […] The city has many wealthy Vaishya elders and foreign merchants, with beautiful homes […] The lanes are kept in good order. – A Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms (AD 399–414) (Translated by J.

Just as you may have perceived the excerpt from Faxian’s travelogue differently from your friends, a group of historians may examine the same source and draw varied interpretations from it. Historians then look at more sources to corroborate their understanding. This reminds us of the need to assess multiple sources, perspectives and interpretations before drawing conclusions. Glimpses of the Gupta Empire Governance and administration Let us observe the map in Fig. 7.8. You will notice that many kingdoms coexisted during the same period. Some of them may have been at war with each other in their ambition to expand their control. Recall what we saw earlier about Kauṭilya’s ideas on ruling a kingdom. He advised rulers to form alliances (mitra) as one of the components of the saptānga. New kings … new titles Inscriptions and coins provide valuable insights into the titles adopted by Gupta rulers, such as ‘mahārājadhirāja’, ‘samrāṭ’, and ‘chakravartin’. These titles reflected their claim to supreme authority and emphasised their superiority over earlier rulers who used simpler titles like ‘rājan’ and ‘mahārāja’. The Gupta rulers used various strategies, including military conquests, diplomacy, and alliances, to expand and consolidate their vast empire. The last method included matrimonial alliances. A well-known example is that of Prabhāvatī Gupta, Outcastes: Someone who has been rejected from a social or cultural group; in this case, a category of people considered socially too low to be part of the varṇa system."}

{"id": "class 7__sst__p178__c1", "text": "156 Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1 The Gupta Empire had a well-organised system of administration. Instead of controlling everything from a central authority, they divided the empire into provinces and granted land to local rulers, priests and chieftains. These land grants were carefully inscribed on copper plates to keep accurate records — many of which have been discovered by archaeologists in recent times. This system helped ensure proper tax collection and allowed the Gupta rulers to govern efficiently while still giving local leaders some control over their regions. Thriving trade The primary source of revenue of the Gupta’s was land tax. Other sources included fines, taxes on mines, irrigation, trade and crafts. This revenue was used for administration, maintaining the army, building temples and infrastructure, and supporting scholars and artists. As we see once again, for such an empire to sustain itself, it had to promote a vibrant internal and external trade. In the Gupta era, India traded with the Mediterranean world, Southeast Asia and China, exporting textiles, spices, ivory and gemstones. The Indian Ocean trade network connected Indian ports to distant markets. One significant stop on the way to the Mediterranean markets was Socotra Island, strategically located in the Arabian Sea. Archaeological evidence, such as pottery, inscriptions in the Brahmi script, and designs such as a Buddhist stūpa, has established the presence of Indian traders there over several centuries, apart from traders from Egypt, Arabia, Rome and Greece. This small island carries evidence of the rich cultural exchanges that trade promoted in the Indian Ocean. New Ideas and Wonders: The Classical Age As we saw, Gupta rulers were devout followers of Viṣhṇu; this is often reflected in their coins and inscriptions. However, they also supported other traditions and schools of thought. They patronised Buddhist institutions, including the renowned Nālandā university and several other Buddhist vihāras (monastery). Their approach was inclusive and open. We will explore these institutions further in higher grades."}

They deal with a wide range of topics — the cataloguing and diagnosing of diseases, their treatments, the importance of diet in maintaining good health, the preparation of medicines, and surgical techniques advanced for their time. Importantly, Āyurveda emphasises holistic healing and a deep connection between the mind, body, and nature. The Quest for Beauty The Gupta rulers created a supportive environment where creativity and craftsmanship thrived; some of the iconic works of history were produced during this time.

The fierce Hūṇa tribe from central Asia repeatedly attacked the empire, weakening its control over north India. At the same time, the rise of powerful regional rulers led to internal conflicts. However, was this truly the end, or the beginning of a period that marked a turning point in Indian history? We will explore this question in the next part of this book. Meanwhile in the South and Northeast ... Let us go back to the map in Fig. 7.8. While the Guptas ruled in the north, the Pallavas emerged as a powerful dynasty in the south, gradually consolidating their power in parts of present- day Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Their origins are not clearly known, but they appear to have been a tributary power under the Sātavāhanas, whom we encountered in the previous chapter, and to have gained power as the Sātavāhanas declined.

People go on pilgrimages to these shrines on special occasions. Naturally, when we turn to religions that originated in India, we find that they have many more sacred sites. In the case of Buddhism, those are often places that were visited by the Buddha or where his relics are kept. Among them is the Great Stūpa at Sanchi (Madhya Pradesh), which is a relic stūpa (you saw this in the chapter on ‘The Rise of Empires’), and the Mahabodhi Stūpa in Bodh Gaya (Bihar), where, according to Buddhist tradition, the Buddha attained enlightenment. They are important sites for pilgrims; Bodh Gaya, for instance, receives more than four million visitors every year.

For at least 3,000 years, and with no modern means of transportation available, Indians have been crisscrossing the Subcontinent, resulting in its entire geography being considered sacred. We will return to this soon. Tīrtha: Literally, a place where one can cross a river or other body of water. Symbolically, it becomes a place where one can cross from the ordinary worldly life to a higher, spiritual life. Such places are held in high reverence and regarded as sacred. India has, for ages past, been a country of pilgrimages. All over the country, you find these ancient places, from Badrinath, Kedarnath and Amarnath, high up in the snowy Himalayas down to Kanyakumari in the south. What has drawn our people from the south to the north and from the north to the south in these great pilgrimages? It is the feeling of one country and one culture. — Jawaharlal Nehru, 1961 Here’s an excerpt from the writings of Dharampal, a historian and thinker: “I was travelling from Gwalior to Delhi … when I met a group of people … about twelve of them, some three or four women and seven or eight men ... They said that they had been on a pilgrimage, three months long, up to Rameswaram, among other places. They came from two different villages north of Lucknow. They had various bundles of things and some earthen pots with them ... They had taken all the necessities for their food—atta, ghee, sugar— with them … I asked them, “You are going to Delhi now?” “Yes!”, they replied. “You will stop in Delhi?” “No, we only have to change trains there. We’re going to Haridwar! ... We don’t have time … We have to go to Haridwar. And then we have to get back home.”"}

Æ In ancient times, when people were travelling from Madurai in Tamil Nadu to Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, what languages would they come across? How would they communicate with people in those places? Where would they stay? What food would they eat? In the Jain tradition, the tīrthas are associated with places where the Tīrthankaras attained liberation or where significant events of their lives occurred. Trees, ponds, hills and mountains that the Tīrthankaras visited or meditated at are also considered sacred. Examples of such places include Mount Abu, Girnar and the Śhatruñjaya hill in Saurashtra (Gujarat). Another example is the pilgrimage to Sabarimala temple (Kerala), dedicated to the deity Ayyappa, which draws over ten million devotees every year. This hilltop shrine was traditionally Tīrthankara: Literally, someone who makes a tīrtha, that is, who guides the crossing from ordinary to higher life. In Jainism, the Tīrthankaras are the supreme preachers of dharma. reached by an immensely difficult trek through hills and forests. Such a challenging approach, common to many hilltop or mountain shrines all over the country, symbolises the difficulties of the inner path, with natural landmarks along the route being considered sacred.

In Grade 6 we learnt that in such belief systems, people regard elements of Nature, such as mountains, rivers, trees, plants and animals, and sometimes stones too, as sacred. In Hinduism, for instance, this includes countless geographical sites or features of Nature, such as specific mountains, rivers and forests, which are regarded as particularly divine and are worshipped as deities; many rivers are regarded as devīs, while some species of trees, animals and plants are particularly holy. This tradition comes from the perception of a divine presence in all of Nature. Ultimately, the whole of planet Earth is considered sacred — she is Mother Earth or Bhūdevī. Here are a few more examples of such traditions:  The Niyam Dongar hill in the Niyamgiri Range of Jharkhand is sacred to the Dongria Khond tribe. They believe that the hill is the abode of Niyam Raja, the supreme deity who provides everything they need for sustenance. Cutting trees here is prohibited and considered a sign of disrespect to the deity.  In the early 2000s, the Government of Sikkim identified several sacred mountains, caves, lakes, rocks and hot springs that were to be protected against all forms of damage.  In the Nilgiris of Tamil Nadu, the Todas, a tribal community, regard many mountain peaks as sacred and associate them with their gods. To them, this sense of sacredness extends to many plants (which often become part of their rituals), Shola forests, wetlands, and even specific stones and individual trees. Fig. 8.5.

Though spread all over India, they are also interconnected. For example, some Hindus aspire to do the chār dhām yātrā, and those four sites appear to have been deliberately located in the southern, northern, eastern and western corners of India! A similar aspiration exists with respect to the 12 jyotirlingas, which are considered highly auspicious. The 51 Shakti pīṭhas, too, cover the entire map of India (even parts of present-day Bangladesh and Pakistan). And there are many more regional networks. These networks crisscross India’s length and breadth, creating a sacred geography. As a result, the land itself becomes sacred. There is a story about the 51 Shakti pīṭhas. Shakti, the divine mother in the form of Satī, and her consort, Śhiva, were insulted by her father. An angry Satī immolated herself. Shiva was so livid that he took her body and refused to allow the last rites. Śhiva’s anger was dangerous for the world and the cosmos. So Viṣhṇu used his chakra to cut up Satī’s body. The Shakti pīṭhas are the places across the Subcontinent where the body parts of the divine mother fell one by one. The symbol behind the story is clear: the whole land becomes the body of the divine mother. LET’S EXPLORE Note the locations of the chār dhām. What do you think it implied for the people when they travelled north-south and east-west? While visiting the major sacred places connected to their respective faiths, pilgrims would naturally cover the geography of India. They would come across diverse languages, customs, clothing and foods along the way, but would notice the commonalities too. The 12 jyotirlingas are sacred shrines dedicated to Śhiva, a major deity of Hinduism. Each shrine has its own unique mythology and name."}

Apart from religious motivations, some, like merchants and traders, travelled to exchange goods; others travelled to discuss, debate and popularise their beliefs or to learn and study from eminent teachers in different parts of the country. However, though they were travelling for different purposes, their routes often converged. Discussions and debates, sharing of goods, experiences, and tales, enriched everyone. New ideas emerged, and old ones were adapted. This complex process became a major factor in the cultural integration of the Indian Subcontinent. Sacred Ecology Tīrthas are usually located on the banks of a river or a lake, in a forest or on a mountain. As we saw above, the natural landscape itself is thus seen or perceived as sacred space, or puṇyakṣhetra. This perception has helped us to protect and preserve Nature, since we are not distinct from her. So geography, culture and spirituality fuse together in these kṣhetras. Rivers and sangams (confluence of rivers) Rivers have been worshipped in India since Vedic times. The nadīstuti sūkta of the Ṛigveda is a hymn (sūkta) in praise of (stuti) rivers (nadī) that invokes 19 major rivers of ancient northwest India. Even today, many rituals involving water invoke the presence of some of the most important rivers of India: gange cha yamune chaiva godāvarī sarasvatī narmade sindhu kāverī jalesmin sannidhiṃ kuru Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari, Sarasvati, Narmada, Sindhu, and Kaveri, may you manifest in this water. Those rivers have been lifelines for the Indian civilisation. Their sources, tributaries and the places they flow through are often regarded as sacred too, and are visited by many pilgrims. In local languages, these rivers are referred to with respect—for instance, ‘Ganga ji’ or ‘Yamuna ji’."}

That is why many tīrthas and temples in India are located on hilltops, as the physical journey to these peaks is seen as a symbolic journey to reach the divine. People would undertake arduous walks through mountain trails to those sites and shrines, which tested not only their physical abilities but also their mental strength.

These texts have vivid descriptions of pilgrimages undertaken and places visited, and of sacred rivers, forests and mountains.

Since it stays green almost through the year, it provides food and shelter to many types of birds and other animals. Over time, many rural and tribal communities across India decided to protect and preserve some natural forests from harmful activities such as hunting, tree felling or mining. They saw those forests as the abodes of deities — for example, Ryngkew or Basa in Meghalaya. Such special forests are called ‘sacred groves’ in English (see the table below for a few names in regional languages) and, thanks to their sacred status, have come to shelter great biodiversity of flora and fauna. Many sacred groves are also home to small water bodies and thus help in water conservation. There were many thousands of sacred groves in India. Sadly, these numbers have been shrinking as people have started encroaching on them for various purposes, from agriculture to industry. Still, sacred groves continue to be protected in many regions of India. Fig. 8.11. A shrine in Bastar, Chhattisgarh, celebrating Rāma’s passing through the area Fig. 8.12. A seal from Mohenjo-daro"}

Besides, bats play a critical role in the pollination of flowers and in the dispersal of seeds. Sacred groves thus evolve a harmonious relationship between the deity, the ecosystem, and humans. From pilgrimage to trade Pilgrims encounter traders and merchants along their journey. This interaction benefits both groups. Pilgrims need various items, which traders can provide. As a result, the pilgrimage routes and the trade routes often overlap. Some traders might also double as pilgrims, taking their wares to distant towns and cities while visiting sacred sites and shrines. What routes did those traders use in ancient India? Revisit the map of trade routes (Fig. 5.5) in the chapter ‘The Rise of Empires’.

{"id": "class 7__sst__p209__c1", "text": "187 Governance and Democracy 9 – From the Rulers to the Ruled: Types of Government What is Democracy? As we studied in Grade 6, ‘democracy’ is best understood as ‘rule of the people.’ This means that the source of power and authority in a democracy are the people of the country. Let’s understand this with the example of a school. A school example A school is full of activities and things that must be done. Many day-to-day tasks need to be managed, and things need to be organised. For example, there are timetables to be made and followed, sports activities to be organised, food to be served during lunch time (also called the mid-day-meal), utensils to be cleaned, speakers to be decided for the morning assembly, and activities to be arranged for ‘No Bag Days’. The list is very long in terms of all that needs to be done in the school. With so many things to be done, the Head Teacher realised that a Student Committee should be appointed so that students can be part of making the relevant rules to get all this done, then help in implementation of the rules, and ensure that the rules are being followed. The question before the Head Teacher was — who will be part of the committee? The Head Teacher discussed this in the assembly. She proposed that it would be good if some students can take responsibility for these tasks. A student committee should be formed. Hearing this, the students got excited and started arguing. Naghma: Students in Grade 12 are the most senior; we will take care of everything. Shobha: But you will finish school in a few months. The students in Grade 11 should take care of everything. Gurpreet: If the students of only one grade will take care of everything, then how will they know about the problems that other grades face? Fig. 9.3 THINK ABOUT IT The school example helps us to understand the concept of representation and how it works. However, the students’ committee is different from Parliamentary and Legislative committees, as class representatives in a school are quite different from Members of Parliament (MPs) and Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs). What are these differences? Discuss with your teacher in the classroom and make a list."}
{"id": "class 7__sst__p210__c1", "text": "188 Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1 In this exciting situation, the students finally came to three options:  Everyone in the school becomes part of the committee and takes responsibility.  The Head Teacher chooses the students herself for the committee.  The students choose their representatives through voting, and the chosen representatives become the members of the committee. LET’S EXPLORE Which of the three methods do you think is most effective? Why? The first method may seem appealing, but if every student in the school is part of the committee, it will be difficult to reach decisions and manage implementation effectively. In the second method, since the Head Teacher selects the students for the committee, many students will not have a role and won’t have a way to ensure that their voices are heard regarding what they need and want. However, in the third method, students from each grade can choose one representative from among themselves — someone they believe will effectively advocate for their class’s needs. This representative will serve on the committee, meaning that the student committee will consist of representatives from each grade. This approach is a democratic way to choose representatives and form a committee. Functions of Government Previously, we discussed the various roles that a government plays in our lives, similar to the responsibilities of a student committee in a school. Just like the school committee, a government must create necessary rules, implement them, and ensure that everyone follows these rules. These three responsibilities are known as the functions of government. Representative: A person who is chosen to act or make decisions on behalf of another person or group of people"}

The implementation of these rules and the administration of the country according to them is known as the executive function. Finally, ensuring that the rules are followed is referred to as the judicial function. Democracy is defined as the ‘rule of the people’. This means that, similar to the third method of electing representatives in a school, in a democracy, the people select their representatives to govern them. However, not every country uses the same method for choosing these representatives. We will explore this topic in more detail in the following sections. DO YOU KNOW?

Since countries have their own history, culture, and aspirations, it is natural that governments of different countries are different. Let’s look at some aspects that can make one form of government different from another. These differences will become clearer when we look at various types of government later in the chapter. Key differences between governments Who gets to decide that ‘this is the government’? How is the government formed? What are the different parts of the government and what do they do? 1. Who gets to decide that ‘this is the government’? This is the most basic difference across many types of government. Who or what says that ‘this is the government of our country’? That is, who or what gives the government its authority and power? For example, in a democracy like India, it is the people of the country who decide and are the source of authority, while in a theocracy, the source of authority is religious beliefs and the head of a religious institution. 2. How is the government formed? In a democracy, a government is formed usually through some kind of election. While in kingdoms which have kings or queens, the kind that you have read about in other chapters, usually someone from within the family continues to rule and decide how the government will be set up. There are other ways of forming a government, and even in democracies there can be different kinds of elections. 3. What are the different parts of the government and what do they do? Any government has many parts and systems, and these vary across different types of government. For example, the three functions of government referred to earlier — legislative, executive, and judiciary — can be performed by totally independent bodies or by the same body. The system to decide how the government will work can be written down in a book of fundamental rules of the country, called the ‘constitution’, which is what happens in most"}

Or it can be decided by the king or queen, as it happens in ‘monarchies’ — governments of kings or queens. 4. What is the government working for? What goals is it trying to achieve? Governments are designed to work towards certain values and ideals. Some governments, like the government of India, are designed to work towards equality and prosperity for all, while some other governments may be designed only for the prosperity of some families or groups. There are differences between different forms of government based on these four major aspects, but there could be other kind of differences. So, let us now look at some types or forms of government. Democratic Governments around the World Democracy is the most popular form of government in the modern world. In this part of the chapter, we will see that there are different kinds of democratic governments. Before we get into the differences, we should know that there are some fundamental principles of any democracy. Fundamental principles of democracy What is the government working for? What goals is it trying to achieve? Equality in a democracy means that every person has the right to be treated equally. It also means that everyone should have equal access to facilities like education and health, and that everyone is equal before the law. Freedom in democracy means that citizens have the right to make their own choices and express their opinions. Representative participation means that every person has a right to choose and elect their representatives. This is done through the process of elections. Elected representatives become a part of the legislature."}
{"id": "class 7__sst__p214__c1", "text": "192 Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1 It is useful to remember that even these fundamental principles have evolved over time. For example, India provided universal adult franchise (meaning the right to vote in elections to all adults) from the very beginning of the Indian republic in 1950; on the other hand, in Switzerland, women got the right to vote only in 1971. Clearly, the above principles are ideals; not all democracies are able to put them in practice. But equally clearly, it is important for the citizens to keep these ideals in front of them. Different forms of democratic governments Let us now understand the different forms of democratic governments around the world. 1. Direct democracy This is a form of democracy where all the citizens of a country are directly responsible for all the rules, regulations and functions. They participate in all the decisions directly. In contemporary times, some kinds of this form are followed in a few countries, like Switzerland. The limitation of this form of government is that it is very hard to carry out in practice, particularly in larger countries — just as we saw in our school story: if everyone becomes a part of the Universal adult franchise grants every citizen (above a certain age) the right to vote to choose their representative. Fundamental rights of a citizen, such as — right to equality, right to freedom of speech and expression, and right against exploitation — are all provided and protected in a democracy. Independent judiciary ensures that every citizen’s fundamental rights are protected, and that laws are followed by the citizens and also by all the parts of the government."}

Representative democracy This is the form of democratic government in which the people elect their representatives through universal adult franchise, just like in India. In this form of democracy, the people do not directly govern, but the government is always accountable to the people. Elections are an integral part of representative democracy through which people can express changes in their choices as well. To accomplish this, elections happen in regular and fixed intervals of time. In India we have general elections every five years, while in the United States of America they occur every four years. DON’T MISS OUT As we stated in the beginning, democracies have evolved over time, and so have their characteristics. Even today, there are a lot of differences in the functioning of these democracies. It is useful to remember that when these countries adopted democracies, they may not have had all the principles of democracy as we understand them today.

But every democracy functions differently. Here are the two forms of representative democracy. a. Parliamentary democracy In this form of government, the members of the executive are also part of the legislature. For example, in India, the prime minister and the council of ministers are also members of the parliament. The council of ministers are accountable to the legislature and continue working as long as they have the confidence of the legislature. In India, the council of ministers can continue working while they have confidence of the Lok Sabha. In this form of government, people elect the legislature but not the executive. Selected members of the legislature become ministers. b. Presidential democracy In this form of government, the executive works independently of the legislature. The president is elected by the people. The president does not need to have the confidence of the legislature for his / her position. In some countries like India, states within the country such as Rajasthan or Kerala have their own governments, but they are not completely independent. They are still governed by a larger national government, the Union Government of India. The different forms of democratic government have different structures.

{"id": "class 7__sst__p219__c1", "text": "197 Governance and Democracy 9 – From the Rulers to the Ruled: Types of Government A Peek into History Early republics A republic is a form of government in which the head of state is elected and is not a hereditary monarch. This was the case in at least two of India’s ancient mahājanapadas, as you might recall from the chapter ‘New Beginnings: Cities and States’. In the Vajji (or Vṛiji) mahājanapada, the Lichchhavi clan, in particular, practised collective decision-making, and leaders were chosen based on merit rather than birth. Key positions were filled through elections, and representatives from various clans met regularly to address issues and develop solutions to ensure the people’s welfare. As a result, such states have been called early republics. Indeed, the voice of the common people has been valued and upheld in India through the ages, even when the power was in the hands of a king or queen. A remarkable example from the Chola period is seen in the Uttaramerur inscriptions from the 10th century CE in Tamil Nadu, which provide us with details about the election of members to the village sabhā (local administrative body). We learn about the election process, including sealed ballot boxes, qualifications of members, their duties, and also the conditions that could lead to their dismissal. Fig. 9.6.

There were republics in other parts of the world too. In the 5th and 4th centuries BCE, Rome and Greece had republics. In some regions of Greece, free men could vote, but women, workers and slaves could not. Other areas had a system where only a small, privileged group could vote or make decisions. Other Forms of Government In the previous sections we saw that democracy is the most popular form of government in today’s world, and that there are different forms of democracy as well. Let us now look at other forms of governments, and understand their basic structures. 1. Monarchy As we saw in chapters of ‘Tapestry of the Past’, mahājanapadas were headed by kings, who were guided by the sabhā or samiti and were expected to take decisions and advice of these institutions seriously. As empires were built and expanded across India, kings began to gain immense power. Yet, they relied on a council of ministers and a network of officials to help them govern the empire. In many cases, the king also sought the advice of learnt scholars on matters related to dharma. Of course, there were also examples of kings who used their power to subjugate their people. In some parts of the world, kings had all the power; they made the laws, enforced them, and also decided the punishments. In some cases, they claimed to have received divine power from God. However, in many parts of India, the power of the raja was neither absolute nor beyond question. The king was Subjugate: To take control of people or a place by using force and make the people obey. Slave: A person who is forced to work for and obey another and is considered to be their property. Fig. 9.7. Adoration of the pillar of Sanchi Stūpa"}

This was an ideal that kings did not necessarily achieve. THINK ABOUT IT What might happen if the king considered himself to have divine powers? How would he rule over the people? DON’T MISS OUT In the Shānti Parva of the Mahābhārata, when Bhīṣhma, the wise elder of the Kuru dynasty, lies on a bed of arrows awaiting his death, he teaches Yudhiṣṭhira, the eldest Pāṇḍava, at great length on good governance, justice, and the moral responsibilities of a raja. A raja is not just a ruler; the welfare of his people is his highest priority. He must apply the law without bias to ensure fairness and equality. He must not get attached to power, as it fosters ego and corruption. He must seek guidance from wise advisors to ensure just and well-informed decisions. The raja must understand that his authority is temporary and bound by dharma. Fig. 9.8.

When the builders complained to the king that he did not even allow them to take measurements, the king blamed them for not asking the cobbler’s permission first. The king received the cobbler, who explained that his humble hut was like a mother to him and as precious to him as the palace was to the king: “The misery people feel when their homes are forcibly taken away can be described only by a god who has fallen from his celestial car or by a king who has lost his kingdom!” Nevertheless, the cobbler expressed his readiness to let go of his hut if only the king would come and respectfully ask for his permission — which the king did, giving him adequate money as compensation. “For those who desire happiness, there should be no false pride,” concludes the text, while the cobbler praised the king’s commitment to dharma, even towards a lowly subject! – From Rājataraṅgiṇī by the Kashmiri scholar Kalhaṇa (12th century CE) 2. Monarchies today A monarchy is the type of government that is ruled by a monarch. Kings and queens are called monarchs, who exercise their sovereign power. Monarchies are usually hereditary; typically, the eldest son of the ruling monarch becomes the next king. Today we have two types of monarchy: a. Absolute monarchy In an absolute monarchy the monarch has complete control in the making of laws, Sovereign: Sovereign indicates that the source of power of a country is independent from external influence. Monarchs: Kings or queens who inherit their position from their family, usually passing it from one generation to the next within the royal family."}

Saudi Arabia is an example of an absolute monarchy; here the king holds all power and governs according to Islamic law. However, he appoints a council that advises and assists him on governance; but he is not bound by the council’s advice. b. Constitutional monarchy Let us consider an example of a different kind of monarchy. The United Kingdom or Britain is also a monarchy. The head of the state is the king or queen, but he or she has only nominal power and the real power of the executive is exercised by the prime minister. The legislative power is exercised by the parliament. This means that all the laws are made by the elected parliament, and executive power is exercised by the Council of Ministers led by the prime minister. So while Britain has a king, it really is, today, a parliamentary democracy. This kind of monarchy is called a constitutional monarchy."}

Theocracy A theocracy is a form of government where the country is ruled by the rules of religion and religious leaders. Iran, whose full official name is ‘Islamic Republic of Iran’ has a unique political system combining elements of both a theocratic and democratic governance. Their constitution is based on the fundamental principles of Islam, the country’s official religion. The Supreme Leader, who has the ultimate authority over the legislature, executive and judiciary, is selected by a group of Islamic clerics and his term is for life. There are also an elected president and a parliament that take care of everyday governance. The intent of the republic is to establish a society based on Islamic norms. Other theocracies currently in existence include Afghanistan and Vatican City. 3. Dictatorship A dictatorship is a form of government in which one person, or a small group possesses absolute power — they do not have any limits imposed on them by a constitution or law. The 20th century witnessed many examples of dictators who created extremely difficult circumstances for the people; we will only see two of them here.  Soon after Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany in 1933, he passed laws that gave him full power and eliminated the opposition. He was now a dictator. Convinced of the superiority of his people, he believed that Germany should rule the world and dominate ‘inferior races’. He was responsible for the killing of at least six million Jews (this is known as the ‘Holocaust’) as well as hundreds of thousands of Roma and other groups of people. In fact, he was the cause for World War II in the years 1939–1945, Fig. 9.10. Caricature of Adolf Hitler"}

Oligarchy The word ‘oligarchy’ is of Greek origin, where olígos means a few and árkhō means to rule or command. It is a type of government where a small, powerful group makes all the important deci- sions; usually they are wealthy families or influential people. In some places in ancient Greece, aristocratic families ruled as oligarchies. In modern times, political commentators have observed that even some democracies show signs of oligarchy when a small group of politicians and wealthy businesspeople hold too much influence in governance.

Do a small role play of the various forms in your classroom: Æ Enact democracy Æ Enact monarchy Æ Enact dictatorship Æ What do you find to be the most suitable form of government? You have read about different forms of government above and how the form of government defines the lives of its citizens. In the previous table, we could see that the representation of people’s choices and rights varies across the different forms. In a genuine democracy, the people can lead their everyday lives in the way they want. They can choose what to speak, what to wear, what beliefs to follow, and how to express themselves. All of this can be done in a democracy until and unless it harms someone else’s rights. In a democratic government, the people choose their government. The government is accountable for protecting the rights of its people and is responsible for providing basic needs to its citizens. If the government does not perform its functions properly, the people can change their representatives through elections. This ensures that there is a constant check of what the government does. Thus, the values and ideals of the government in a democracy should focus on the well-being of all its people. Our country is a democracy, and you can see many of the features of a democracy in our lives every day. It is therefore no wonder that more than half of the countries in the world have adopted democracy and democratic forms of government.

The president takes an oath to preserve, protect, and defend it. The prime minister, council of ministers, and judges promise to follow its provisions. What Is a Constitution? A simple answer is that it is a document that spells out a nation’s basic principles and laws. It lays out:  the framework of the three organs of the government (legislature, executive, and judiciary) and their roles and responsibilities;  checks and balances amongst the three organs of government to ensure fairness, responsibility and accountability;  the rights and duties of the citizens;  an outline of the long-term goals and aspirations of the nation. Why do we need a constitution? LET’S EXPLORE Imagine that your school has reached the final tournament in kabaddi at the state-level. The opponent is a strong team that has won the tournament two years in a row. They are aiming to win a third time, a hat-trick. The match is on, and a player from your team has just got one of the players from the other team ‘out’; then a dispute breaks out. The player from the other team insists that she had already crossed into her team area before your team player caught her. The referee has seen that the player from the other team was indeed ‘out’.

This idea of India being one country is embedded in the Constitution.

On the whole, there has been a great emphasis on the duties and role of the people in governance. It was, therefore, quite natural that the Constitution makers would incorporate these ideas of our civilisational heritage into our Constitution — ‘Fundamental Duties’, for instance, are part of it. Learnings from across the world In addition, in the Indian tradition of ā no bhadrāh kratavo yantu viśhwatah — “Let noble thoughts come to me from every side” — the Constitution makers studied the constitutions of France, USA, UK, Ireland, Australia, and other countries that have a democratic system, to explore their usefulness for our context. For example, the ideals of ‘liberty, equality, fraternity’ were adopted from France’s constitution (which enshrined them from the French Revolution of 1789); the idea of the Directive Principles of State Policy (which we will study shortly) was inspired by the Irish Constitution; and the American Constitution helped shape the concept of an independent judiciary. Fig. 10.5. This ‘Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen’, which focused on equality, liberty and justice for all, was formulated during the 1789 French Revolution. It helped the spread of such ideals in many parts of the world; many constitutions (including the French one) adopted or adapted its values and principles."}

LET’S REMEMBER Æ There are three organs of government — legislature, executive and judiciary — and the ‘separation of powers’ is essential to their effective working. Æ The legislature makes the laws. Æ The law is implemented by the executive, which is headed by the prime minister. Æ The judiciary ensures that all laws made are in accordance with the Constitution. It also decides whether a law has been broken and what punishment is necessary. Æ We have a three-tier system of government — central, state and local (Panchayati raj system). Æ Some functions and responsibilities are reserved for the central government, and others are assigned to the state government. The Constitution addresses these points comprehensively. It clearly defines the roles, functions, responsibilities, and accountability measures for each organ of government. The electoral system has been laid down to ensure that every eligible citizen of the country is enabled to vote. Other core aspects of the Constitution are the Fundamental Duties, Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles of State Policy. The infographic (Fig. 10.14) provides us with examples of a few of the Fundamental Duties and Rights (which are listed in full in the beginning of all NCERT textbooks). The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP, as they are popularly called) represent the essence of the social and economic vision that the framers of the Constitution had for India. The examples we present in the infographic illustrate the principles they wanted governance to follow."}
{"id": "class 7__sst__p243__c1", "text": "221 Governance and Democracy 10 – The Constitution of India — An Introduction DON’T MISS OUT Directive Principles are goals that the government should try to achieve. They reflect the direction they wished the country take to make India better for all; for example, everybody in the country must have a good standard of living. But if the government does not make efforts to follow this, one cannot go to a judge and complain about it. The DPSP are more like guidelines than strict rules. Fundamental Rights, on the other hand are promises that must be kept. If someone treats you unfairly because of who you are, you can actually go to court and the judge can help you. The people who wrote our Constitution created this system on purpose. They wanted some rights that could be demanded immediately (Fundamental Rights) and some bigger goals (Directive Principles) that might take time to achieve as our country progressed.

Sir, the women of India are happy to step into their rightful heritage of complete equality with men in all spheres of life and activity. I say so because I am convinced that this is no new concept which has been postulated for the purposes of this Constitution, but is an ideal that has long been cherished by India, though social conditions for some time had tragically debased it in practice. This Constitution affirms that ideal and gives the solemn assurance that the rights of women in law will be wholly honoured in the Indian Republic. — Begum Aizaz Rasul, 22 November 1949, during the Constituent Assembly’s debates"}

However, we must remember that any changes (called ‘amendments’) to the Constitution are rigorously debated in the Parliament before they are accepted.

You could exchange your extra eraser for the extra pencil that your classmate has. Wouldn’t this satisfy your and the classmate’s needs? This is how the barter system works. Today, we use coins and notes to buy and sell things. People also use their mobile phones and computers for such transactions. The barter system was the earliest form of exchange. There is a lot of evidence of it from around the world. People used commodities such as cowrie shells, salt, tea, tobacco, cloth, cattle (cows, goats, horses, sheep), seeds, etc. Transaction: a piece of business that is done between people, especially an act of buying or selling.

How would you be able to exchange the ox for all the different things you need from different people or places? What difficulties are you likely to face? For one, you would have to find someone who needed an ox. Now, swapping your ox for a pair of shoes would hardly be a fair exchange! You may have had to go through a series of exchanges — for example, find someone to exchange your ox for several bags of wheat.

Just like the farmer, people who depended on the barter system would face many problems in making an exchange in their everyday lives. They would have to find someone who wants the exact item that they want to give, and in return are also able to offer exactly what the other party wants. This scenario is called double coincidence of wants. Even if there are two people who want each other’s goods and are also willing to make an exchange, other issues could arise — in what proportion should the two goods be exchanged? In such cases, it becomes difficult to compare the value of one good against another. If one of the people feels that the exchange is disadvantageous, they would not be interested in the exchange. This is because there is no common standard measure of value. THINK ABOUT IT What are the instances of double coincidence of wants in the above example?

DON’T MISS OUT Although money has replaced traditional barter systems all around the world, there are some that still exist today! One of them is the Junbeel Mela (jun means moon in Assamese and beel means wetland), a three- day annual socio-cultural fair at Junbeel in Morigaon district of Assam. Interestingly, the mela begins with the Agni Puja or worship of fire, a prayer for universal wellbeing. Beginning in the 15th century, the chiefs of the Tiwa, Karbi, Khasi, and Jaintia tribal communities of Assam and Meghalaya would gather every year to discuss political issues and to maintain friendly relationships. Members of these communities began to gather around this event and soon it turned into a fair, where people would bring their produce and began exchanging them among each other.

These are often exchanged with people from the plains for rice cakes, and other types of food that cannot be grown in the hills.  Book exchange: Think of a fun club where you can trade your old books with friends!

What are the types of experiences people have in this process? Basic Functions of Money It is said that “necessity is the mother of invention.” As the types and numbers of things that were being exchanged grew, and the distances across which barter was beginning to take place became longer, it became clear that there was a need for a different system. A common medium of exchange would make trade easier and so, money came into existence. As more and more people began to use it for transactions — buying and selling goods and services — it became the accepted method of payment. As we saw in the farmer’s story above, he could not store the wheat for long as it would rot or get eaten by rats. Fig. 11.7 Fig. 11.8"}

Will you request the shopkeeper to allow you to make the rest of the payment later? The fact that money is accepted as a way of making deferred payments makes money a standard of deferred payment. If the farmer uses money instead of wheat as a medium of exchange, he can keep the money for a longer time and use it for making purchases later. So, money acts as a store of value that can be used later. Isn’t it fascinating! Money also serves as a common denomination that measures the value of goods and services, and enables the comparison of goods and services in terms of their prices. For example, your parents pay money to the shopkeepers in exchange for various products. This money is used by the shopkeepers to pay salaries to their workers.

The minting and issue of coins was controlled entirely by the rulers. Over time, the coins of powerful rulers were accepted across various kingdoms and not just their own. This facilitated trade across geographies. The coins were made from precious metals like gold, silver, and copper or their alloys. They were called kārṣhāpaṇas or paṇas.

Today, in India, we have a central authority called the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that controls the issue of currency. It is not legal for anybody other than the RBI to issue currency. New Forms of Money As time has progressed and technology has advanced, other forms of money have come to be used today. Let’s look at some of them. Krishnappa sells seasonal fruit on a cart. Alongside the colourful fruit that he arranges neatly on his cart is a little card with a QR code. His customers scan the QR code with their mobile phones and pay for their purchase digitally. The payment then goes directly into Krishnappa’s bank account. Apart from tangible forms of money such as coins and paper notes, money has taken intangible forms that we cannot touch and feel. This is called digital money which is in electronic form. Have you observed other people around you making or receiving payments without using coins and notes? Different payment methods like debit cards, credit cards, net banking, UPI (Unified Payments Interface), etc., are also used for transactions. These mediums directly transfer money from one person’s bank account into another. You will learn more about the modern methods of monetary transactions later.

It is also known as bazaar, haat (in Hindi), and mārukatté (in Kannada). What is it called in your region? This can be at a physical place or, as is becoming popular today, online. Goods and services become available to individuals, households, and businesses through markets. For a long time, people have relied on markets to fulfil their needs and wants for goods and services. In addition, markets connect people, traditions, and ideas. Let’s see an example of a market from 16th century India. The Glorious Hampi Bazaar, Karnataka The Hampi Bazaar in Karnataka was one of the prosperous markets in the Vijayanagara Empire which was the centre of flourishing trade. The bazaar was located opposite the Virupaksha temple. The sheer abundance and prosperity of the city have been described in many foreign accounts. The famous Portuguese traveller, Domingos Paes, called Hampi “the best-provided city in the world” due to the wide variety of products traded in the market— grains, seeds, milk, oil, silk, animals like cows, rabbits, horses, and even birds like quails and partridges. Another Portuguese traveller, Fernao Nuniz, wrote about the bazaar, “There were craftsmen, also, working in their streets, so that you Fig. 12.3.

Prepare a set of dialogues between both of you and present it in your class as a skit. Certain features are required for places to be called markets. As you observed in the figure 12.2 (on introductory big spread page number 248) every market has a buyer and a seller. They both need to agree on a price at which the transaction would take place. Price is an important feature in completing a transaction. Price: Price is the amount at which a buyer is willing to buy, and a seller is willing to sell particular goods or services. Fig. 12.4"}

What type of negotiation and bargaining took place in your skit? THINK ABOUT IT Can you think of a type of market where negotiation is less common and why? Prices and Markets What happens when there are many buyers and sellers in the market? How do prices respond to how buyers and sellers interact in the market? In the figure given below, the seller wants to sell the guavas at ₹80 per kg. However, buyers may not be willing to buy at that price. If a buyer finds the price very high, he will ask for a price that he is willing to pay. The seller may not be willing to sell at the price offered by the buyer because it would not be profitable for him. The buyer and seller negotiate until a mutually agreeable price is reached. The transaction can then be completed. If such a point is not reached, i.e. the point where the buyer and the seller agree on a price, the transaction may not take place. Let’s see some scenarios below to understand this. 1. What happens in case the seller fixes the price very high? D80/- Fig. 12.5"}

Markets Around Us Markets are present everywhere and in various forms. Physical and online markets A physical market is where buyers can meet the seller physically, and purchase goods or services in exchange for money. This is the most common type of market. It includes weekly markets and haats where vendors sell vegetables, other essential items, and handicraft items lined up on a cart. Local markets with shops and buzzing with vendors selling street food, knick-knacks, and so on are also physical markets. There are also multi-storey buildings, i.e., malls in cities and towns spanning large areas with stores inside. Today buyers and sellers need not necessarily meet in person to engage in a transaction. They can transact from a convenient location even thousands of kilometres away from each other. They can use shopping applications (apps) or websites on a phone or a computer. These apps or websites are created by businesses that make available a wide variety of goods and services. We will read about how this works in a section below. One can buy goods ranging from books, clothes, furniture, and grocery items to electronic items like TVs, mobile phones, and laptops, and get them delivered to their doorstep. Manufacturers can also buy components online to be used as inputs for production of goods. Apart from goods, one can also avail of services like online classes without having to step outside the home. Payments for such services can also be made online.

Although buying and selling is an economic activity that involves monetary exchange, interactions in the markets often move beyond just enquiring about the product or service or negotiations between parties. Often, a relationship develops between buyers and sellers that continues even across generations. Some families have long-lasting trusted relationships with their tailor, jeweller, and doctor over decades. Many families in India maintain an account with the local grocer that is settled at the end of the month. So, while the primary role of the market is to promote economic activities, it also has non-economic significance in many people’s lives.

In south India, the sellers of haldi and kumkum (turmeric and vermilion) give a small quantity of haldi and kumkum separately, at no charge, as a mark of auspiciousness and good wishes to the buyer. LET’S EXPLORE Have you observed any such practices in your community or neighbourhood? Describe the practice as a drawing or in a short paragraph. Government’s Role in the Market Markets function through interactions of demand from buyers and supply by sellers. However, there are some situations in which this may not work very well. The government plays a crucial role in such situations. It monitors the interaction between consumers and producers, and fair determination of price. Controlling prices for protecting buyers and sellers The government controls the prices of certain goods. For example, it sets the maximum price that the seller can charge. Several essential goods and services, such as lifesaving drugs, have an upper limit on their prices. Another instance is where the government sets the minimum price at which essential agricultural products like wheat, paddy and maize can be sold. This ensures that farmers do not incur losses. The government also sets minimum wages for work done by employees so that employers make fair payments to them. Supply: Quantity of a product or service that sellers are willing and able to sell at a particular price at a given time. Demand: Quantity of a product or service that consumers are willing and able to purchase at a particular price at a given time. Fig. 12.27"}
{"id": "class 7__sst__p288__c1", "text": "266 Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1 However, the government needs to carefully implement such price limits. If the price is too low, producers would not have any motivation to produce. If the prices are too high, consumers would be disadvantaged. LET’S EXPLORE Æ Onions are an important part of the cuisine in most parts of India. In some seasons, the supply of onions comes down in the market. What do you think happens to the price of onions when this happens? Æ What will happen if the people supplying onions do not bring the required quantities to the market? What do you think the government should do in this situation? Ensuring quality and safety standards The government has a role in ensuring the welfare of consumers and protecting them from unfair practices. The government ensures that manufacturers follow the required quality and safety standards while producing goods and delivering services. For instance, pharmaceutical companies manufacture medicines for treating diseases. The government sets procedures for approvals of medicines and conducts sample testing to check if the produced drug meets standards of quality. These regulations ensure the quality and safety of the drugs so that there is no risk to the consumers’ health. Mitigating the external effects of markets Markets sometimes have significant effects beyond the selling and buying. For example, the markets for certain goods require production in factories that could pollute the environment. The government plays a crucial role in understanding and controlling such effects of markets. For example, what happens when the manufacturing of certain items, like single-use plastics, pollutes the environment and poses health risks to consumers? In such cases, the government intervenes by implementing strict regulations to mitigate these negative effects."}
{"id": "class 7__sst__p289__c1", "text": "267 Economic Life Around Us 12 – Understanding Markets Similarly, the government puts in place systems to monitor the weights and measures of the packaged products to check the net quantity contained in the package. THINK ABOUT IT The practice of rulers protecting consumers is not a phenomenon of modern India. Kauṭilya’s Arthaśhāstra includes instructions for the traders trading in clarified butter (ghee). It mentions that buyers shall be given 1 / 50 part more as mānasrāva to compensate for the reduction in quantity owing to (the ghee)…sticking to the measuring can. Governments make rules to ensure markets work fairly and consumers are not exploited. However, too many rules can make it difficult for markets to function properly. Providing public goods Producers make and sell goods and services to be able to make a profit. However, there are some goods and services that producers do not expect to make a profit on; for example, public parks, roads, policing, and so on. In addition, you read about the rights that citizens have to certain welfare provisions in a previous chapter. So, the government provides these public goods and services. THINK ABOUT IT  What are the other areas where you can see the government being involved in the markets?  Are there areas where government intervention needs to be reduced? Discuss with family or relatives. How can consumers assess the quality of products and services? Markets enable access to a wide variety of goods and services to consumers. How will consumers decide what they would like to buy? Public goods: Service or commodity that is accessible or available to all members of a society. Their present use does not diminish their availability for future use."}

Æ The government plays a regulatory role in the markets to promote quality standards for products and services and fair practices in the market. However, consumers can also assess the quality of products and services through certification marks on the products from government agencies and through online reviews. Fig. 12.30"}

Recall a recent visit to a market to purchase a product. What are the different features of a market that you observed during this visit? 2. Remember the epigraph from a famous economist at the beginning of the chapter? Discuss its relevance in the context of the chapter you have read. 3. In the example of buying and selling of guavas, imagine that the seller is getting a good price, and is able to make a profit. He will try to get more guavas from farmers to be able to sell them at the same price and increase his earnings. What is the farmer likely to do in this kind of a situation? Do you think he will start thinking about the demand for guavas in the next season? What is likely to be his response? 4. Match the following types of markets with their characteristics: S.No. Markets Criteria 1 Physical market Goods and services flow outside the nation’s boundaries 2 Online market Deals in bulk quantities 3 Domestic market Serves the final consumers with goods and services 4 International market Requires physical presence of buyers and seller 5 Wholesale market Buyers and sellers meet virtually and can transact at any time 6 Retail market Lies within the boundaries of a nation 5.

Look at the real life situation that a retail seller of vegetables encountered: A family came to shop for vegetables. The price of beans that the seller on the cart was offering was ₹30 / kg. The lady started to bargain with the seller to bring the price down to ₹25 / kg. The seller protested and refused to sell at that price saying he would make a loss at that price. The lady walks away. The family then goes to a super bazaar nearby. They buy vegetables in the super bazaar where they pay ₹40 / kg for the beans that is neatly packed in a plastic bag. What are the reasons that the family does this? Are there factors that affect buying and selling which are not directly connected to price? 7. There are some districts in India that are famous for growing tomatoes. However, during some seasons, the situation is not good for farmers. With a large quantity of harvest, there are reports of farmers throwing away their produce and all their hard work going to waste. Why do you think farmers do this? What role can wholesalers play in such situations? What are the possible ways of ensuring that the tomatoes are not wasted, and the farmers are also not at a loss? 8. Have you heard about or visited a school carnival / fair organized by your school or any other school? Discuss with your friends and teachers about the kind of activities organized by students there. How do they conduct selling and negotiation with the buyers? 9. Choose any 5 products and check out the label with the certification signs discussed in the chapter. Did you find products that did not have a logo? Why do you think this is so? 10. You and your classmates have manufactured a soap bar. Design a label for its packaging. What in your opinion should be mentioned on the label for the consumer to know the product better?"}

{"id": "class 7__vocational education__p3__c1", "text": "Foreword The National Education Policy 2020 envisages a system of education in the country that is rooted in Indian ethos and its civilisational accomplishments in all domains of human endeavour and knowledge, while at the same time preparing the students to constructively engage with the prospects and challenges of the 21st century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured the students’ inherent abilities and touching upon all the five planes of human existence, the pañchakośhas, in the foundational and the preparatory stages have paved the way for the progression of their learning further at the middle stage. Thus, the middle stage acts as a bridge between the preparatory and the secondary stages, spanning three years from Grades 6 to 8. The NCF-SE 2023, at the middle stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages, including at least two languages native to India, science, mathematics, social sciences, art education, physical education and well-being, and vocational education, promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy—a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establishing conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks."}
{"id": "class 7__vocational education__p4__c1", "text": "iv Kaushal Bodh, the activity book of vocational education for Grade 7, is one of these. Its content comprises projects related to three work forms—life forms, machines and materials, and human services. The projects will help students to develop knowledge, skills, attitude and values alongside ecological sensitivity, gender sensitivity, digital skills, and life skills. For all practical purposes, it has, to my mind, succeeded in its curricular goals: first, to foster natural curiosity among students through a proper selection of project; and second, develop among them the core competencies, such as communication, creativity, critical thinking and green skill and vocational skills, such as application of tools, and procedures for design and developing products by intelligently designing various activities, thereby seamlessly integrating content and pedagogy within meaningful contexts. However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries, laboratories and workshops play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this activity book and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders.

{"id": "class 7__vocational education__p5__c1", "text": "About the Book Kaushal Bodh, the activity book of vocational education for Grade 7 is developed in alignment with the vision of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023. In the National Curriculum Framework 2023 (NCF-SE 2023), work has been categorised under three broad forms: work with life forms, work with machines and materials, and work in human services. The intent at this stage is to provide vocational exposure to the students through a wide range of activities categorised into three forms of work. To achieve this, students are expected to take up nine projects across Grades 6 to 8, i.e., three projects in each grade and one from each form of work. Curricular goals, competencies, and learning outcomes have been the guiding principles while developing the activity book. The following Curricular Goals (CG) given in the activity book cover a range of competencies. CG-1: Develops in-depth basic skills and allied knowledge of work and their associated materials or procedures; CG-2: Understands the place and usefulness of vocational skills and vocations in the world of work; CG-3: Develops essential values while working across areas; and CG-4: Develops basic skills and allied knowledge to run and contribute to a home. The activity book contains six illustrative projects, two for each form of work, intended to cover the above curricular goals. The choice of projects is left entirely to schools. One project may be taken up by students or preferably, the school can design other projects based on local considerations. The NCF-SE 2023, and indeed this activity book, encourages schools to select projects based on local considerations and availability of resources. Annexure 1 provides a template for designing a project other than those in the book. The illustrative projects are as follows: Project 1 is on developing a Plant Nursery. Students will engage in creating and maintaining a plant nursery on school grounds or in pots."}
{"id": "class 7__vocational education__p6__c1", "text": "vi They will learn about the various agricultural practices through field visits and hands-on learning, with a focus on the conditions essential for the propagation of plants. Project 2 is on developing a School Habitat Garden. Students will study a variety of life within the school premises or nearby areas and learn about the needs of different groups of animals. They will design a garden, including non-plant elements, to meet these needs. This project will enhance their observational skills, knowledge of biodiversity, and the significance of conservation. It will also instill a sense of environmental stewardship and the importance of protecting natural habitats. Project 3 is on Tie and Dye. In this project, students will explore various techniques used for tie and dye. They will learn to use tools and materials to create functional or artistic items, fostering creativity, problem-solving, and technical skills. This project will encourage innovation and creative thinking, preparing students for potential careers in design and fashion. Project 4 is on developing an AI Assistant. It will introduce students to the fundamentals of machine learning. They will learn to train a machine to identify data related to their surroundings. This project will enhance their technological proficiency, creativity, and logical thinking. Project 5 is on Puppetry. Storytime with Puppets project will help students develop the skills of writing a script, making puppets and putting up a show to narrate a story of their choice or to develop awareness. This project will cultivate an appreciation for heritage, enhance organisational skills, and promote teamwork. It will also provide a platform for students to express their creativity. Project 6 is on developing a Family Health Handbook. In this project, students will reflect on the components of physical health and mental well-being. They will learn about the needs of people of different age groups. This project will teach them how to respond in case of ill health, the importance of healthy eating, and the importance of physical activity and social interaction. As the culmination of the work done through the year related to vocational education, a Kaushal Mela will be organised by the school at the end of the year to showcase the products students have created and"}
{"id": "class 7__vocational education__p7__c1", "text": "vii the services they have learnt. It will also be an opportunity for students to share their experiences and learnings. Community members and key functionaries may be invited to the Kaushal Mela. Finally, annexures include a planning template, competencies and learning outcomes to be achieved in Grade 7, suggestive projects in each of the forms of work in some detail, and time required for each of the illustrative projects. Cross-cutting themes, such as Indian Knowledge Systems, values, heritage, gender sensitivity, and inclusion have been integrated into all the projects. Reflective and thought-provoking questions included under different activities are engaging and they promote joyful learning along with assessment. Students are provided opportunities to do different things, record small successes, take and give feedback, work with peers, try and re-try tasks, answer questions, reflect, and experience the values related to work. Illustrations have been designed depicting the context and processes to enhance learning. In-text questions are also included to assess comprehension of the idea or the subject. At the end of the project, questions given in ‘Think and Answer’ are designed to encourage critical thinking, reasoning, and analysing. Students can access the additional resources provided in the Quick Response (QR) code for each project. We sincerely hope that students will enjoy doing these projects and they will help develop the desired and intended competencies.

{"id": "class 7__vocational education__p10__c1", "text": "Note for School Heads and Teachers Teachers are pivotal to achieving the goals set out in the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 introduces vocational education as a distinct subject starting in Grade 6. The purpose of this subject is to promote ‘learning by doing’, ‘dignity of labour’, and the development of vocational capacities through exposure to a wide range of work. Successful implementation will aid in developing responsible and confident adults who value all professions. Vocational education in schools also offers a robust medium for holistic learning by offering students opportunities to apply conceptual learning in other curricular areas to real-life situations. In Grade 7, students will take up one project in each of the ‘Forms of Work’. The sequence of these projects is not important, so long as all the projects are completed within the academic year. These projects can be taken up at the same time or one after the other. Groups of students may also take up different projects, which depends on the nature of the project and other factors, such as the number of students, resources available, and so on. Please note that it is important to identify concepts across curricular areas that students need to know (e.g., seed germination for projects on Life Forms) and ensure that they have been covered before starting the project. In this activity book, the projects are designed as per the Learning Outcomes for Vocational Education in Grade 7. The focus is on the following: 1. Using physical tools/equipment for carrying out different processes to perform authentic tasks. 2. Gaining clarity about what is to be done and reaching the final outcome through breaking down a task into smaller activities that are easier to complete. 3. Understanding how to prepare materials and use tools and equipment, while following safety measures and protocols. 4. Connecting the activities done in school to the world of work. 5. Assessing work done in terms of quantity and quality. 6. Applying what is learnt in school to daily life. 7. Working collaboratively in groups while ensuring individual participation in each activity."}
{"id": "class 7__vocational education__p11__c1", "text": "xi In doing so, students will be able to develop values related to work, particularly respect for all work. They will realise the importance of the dignity of labour, which means that no work is considered superior and therefore, no work or person should be discriminated against on any basis. The projects in the Activity Book are illustrative. Schools can choose to take up any one or design their own from each form of work. Annexure 1 provides guidelines for designing a project in alignment with curricular goals, competencies and learning outcomes. Annexure 3 has details of five additional projects in each form of work. Thus, for each form of work, schools may (i) select one project from each form of work; (ii) design their own projects; (iii) further detail out any one of the additional projects given in the Activity Book. Pedagogy and Assessment Projects comprise a set of activities that are generally expected to be completed in a group or individually, as required. Resources for projects (e.g., tools, equipment, materials, use of workspaces, etc.) and resource persons or master instructors (e.g., mechanics, farmers, craftspersons, artisans, persons working in technology, and experts in the field) must be drawn from the community. Exposure visits and interactions with professionals are built into the project to enable students to observe and understand work in real settings. The total time allotted to vocational education is 110 hours or 165 periods in one academic year, excluding time for assessment, school events, bagless days and similar activities (Section 4.3 of the NCF-SE 2023). These periods may be distributed across the week as two blocks of two periods on week-days and one period on Saturday. Each project is expected to be completed in about 30 hours (approximately 55 periods of 40 minutes each). This duration is to ensure a long-term engagement that allows students to complete a set of interrelated activities. It also gives them time for trial and error, to try out things differently, and to extend their learning into other activities. The focus of the projects must be creativity and demonstration of skills, and the process of ‘doing’ rather than just the ‘product’ or"}
{"id": "class 7__vocational education__p12__c1", "text": "xii outcome. Working in groups and observing people with expertise is important to foster an appreciation for teamwork, creativity, sensitivity, persistence, and other important values related to work. Students must be active throughout, as they take up activities that are directly connected to real life and the world of work. They must be able to integrate learning from other curricular areas into the projects. Prevalent biases must be addressed, for example, by not assigning specific work roles to a particular gender or to students from a specific social group. All students must participate in the activities. To ensure the participation of students with disabilities, projects can be adapted or an entirely different project may be developed. The activity book is designed to enable continuous assessment by teachers, as well as self and peer-assessment by students. The questions and formats for recording require students to assess their own progress, share their learning and reflections, and record their answers as they move from one activity to the next. Students must also maintain a portfolio in order to help them see their own progress, and record the processes and products related to the projects. It may contain any work done by students, including additional notes, presentations, sketches or photographs (besides those in the activity book) related to the project, and products they have created. Assessing the inculcation of values related to work (e.g., initiative, persistence and focus, responsibility, discipline, eye for detail, curiosity and creativity, empathy and sensitivity, and willingness to do physical work) is particularly important. Students must be observed while at work to assess the same. Checklists and rubrics that outline specific behaviours and attitudes related to work values may be developed by the teachers. Annexure 2 contains the competencies to be developed across the middle stage and the learning outcomes to be achieved in Grade 7. While this is true for all subjects, the role of feedback is particularly important in vocational education. Students must be encouraged and motivated by recognition of their work and their creativity. This approach ensures that all students are able to complete their work successfully through ongoing guidance, which in turn is motivating."}

The paper pencil test, could include situational questions, concept maps, flowcharts, questions related to learning from visits, and multiple-choice questions. Each project also has a set of questions in the last section. These questions address key aspects of learning and concepts that are strengthened while doing the activities. To reiterate, the focus must be on assessing capacities and understanding of processes. A suggested weightage and marking scheme for assessment and evaluation is given below: Mode of Assessment Weightage Written Test 10% Oral Presentation/Viva Voce 30% Activity Book 30% Portfolio 10% Teachers’ Observations during Activities 20% Criteria for Project Selection The activity book is meant for students, and therefore speaks to them.

These components are aligned with the competencies defined for vocational education in the NCF-SE 2023 (please refer to Annexure 2). Therefore, any project other than those in the activity book must include the same components. Examples of additional projects are given in Annexure 3. The projects in this activity book are not mandatory, therefore schools are free to choose any one of these from each form of work or design an entirely different project. Students must also be encouraged to come up with ideas for projects.

When you think about work, you must remember two things: (i) all work is important, and (ii) people work not only to make a living, but also to make life more joyful and interesting. In daily life, you see people doing various kinds of work. Some of the work is related to running a household while some is related to earning a living. Vocational education prepares you to deal with practical things related to daily life and understand the world of work. The projects that you will do in school will give you an opportunity to work with your hands, work in groups with your peers, and learn the skills which help you become self-dependent in life.

{"id": "class 7__vocational education__p26__c1", "text": "4 Kaushal Bodh— Grade 7 Plants propagate, that is, they reproduce themselves, through various methods. Tiny seeds germinate and grow into a huge tree or a small flowering plant. However, some plants can be grown directly from the branches of the mother plant or tubers (e.g. potatoes). Like humans, plants require a suitable environment to survive and grow. In science, you have learned that plants need air, sunlight, nutrients, and water for their growth. These factors are essential, but beyond them, plants also need a favourable environment to thrive, just like we do. Let us understand this with an example. Do you live in a warm and humid region, a cold and dry region, or a place that experiences different seasons? If you reside in a cold and dry area, you might have heard people say, “It is so dry”, the dryness can cause itchy skin and burning sensation in the nostrils. That is why, when using a heater or bukhari, people often place a bowl of water in the room to add moisture to the air. But what causes humidity or dryness? As you have studied, air contains various components, including water vapour. When there is a high amount of water vapour in the air, the weather feels humid, whereas a lower amount makes the air dry. Just like too much or too little humidity affects us, it also impacts plants, especially during their growth stages. Similarly, extreme temperatures can be uncomfortable for humans, and plants also require an “optimal temperature” to grow. However, the ideal temperature varies among plants, which is why some plants flourish only in specific seasons. Have you observed that more plants grow near a water stream, on the edges of ponds or near water sources (e.g., wells, water-tap) than in dry places? This is because they get optimum temperature, humidity, and moisture in the soil. In the plant nursery (Figure 1.1) you will need to create these conditions for optimum survival and growth of plants."}
{"id": "class 7__vocational education__p27__c1", "text": "5 Plant Nursery Plant nurseries are important for various reasons, e.g., preserving original plant species, and creating new varieties of plants, and producing plants on a very large scale. Since nurseries are developed in a smaller space compared to farms, it is easier to prevent pests and provide protection from unsuitable conditions like heavy rain or severe heat. Since conditions for healthy growth of plants can be created in plant nurseries, plants can be grown whenever required and not only during the seasons that are generally suitable for them. People visit plant nurseries to buy plants for their homes, gardens and agriculture field. What will I be able to do? At the end of project, you will be able to: 1. Describe the needs of germinating seeds and young plants. 2. Cultivate new plants using different plant propagation methods. 3. Provide suitable conditions for initial growth of plants. 4. Develop a plant nursery in the school. Did you know? Thimmamma Marimanu, a banyan tree located in Ananthapuramu district of Andhra Pradesh, is spread over 5 acres. This is the size of a small village. Imagine! A tree spread so far that it could house an entire village under its branches. Isn’t it fascinating that a single seed has grown into such a big tree? The banyan tree provides shade, oxygen and shelter to birds, animals and humans. It teaches us to care for nature and plants. Figure 1.2: Banyan tree in Ananthapuramu district, Andhra Pradesh"}

Be careful not to upload or download anything without checking. Do not share personal information anywhere. What do I need to know before I start? There are different types of plant nurseries – some may be for growing vegetables, and others for fruit crops, trees, flowering plants, ornamental plants and so on. Different areas will have different kinds of nurseries. While the process of developing the nursery remains the same, the kind of plants change. In agricultural areas, you will find nurseries for vegetables like brinjal, tomato, onion, etc., and crops like banana. In urban areas, nurseries provide ornamental and flowering plants such as rose, marigold, etc. that can be kept in homes. Where possible, especially in coastal and hilly areas, horticultural nurseries for plants like mango and coconut are set up. Nurseries can be on plots of land or on terraces of buildings. They may be large or small ones maintained at homes. Visiting any one of these will help you to prepare your nursery well. In"}

Rahibai Soma Popere, a recipient of Padma Shri and Nari Shakti Puraskar (Figure 1.12) also known as the ‘Seed Mother of India’ has developed a seed bank in her small home. She has conserved more than 43 indigenous crop varieties and wild food resources. Her work is very important as many native plant species are at risk of being lost due to various factors, making their preservation essential. Figure 1.12: Rahibai ji being honoured with Nari Shakti Puraskar Some of the common seed-sowing methods used in plant nurseries are given below. You can use these methods based on discussion with your peer and the teacher. Method 1: Sowing seeds on raised-bed nursery Step 1: Making raised beds for vegetable or flower seedlings Nursery beds need to be free from weeds and stones. Raised-beds (Figure 1.13) ensure that extra water drains out from the root zone and roots get air for respiration. Follow the steps below to prepare raised-bed: 1. Dig and loosen the soil. 2. Remove bigger stones and pebbles. 3. Mix compost and soil (in a ratio of about 40:60) and raise the marked bed area by 15–20 cm above ground level. 4. The length of the bed could be 3–5 m and width 1–1.5 m. 5. You can maintain a distance of 0.30–0.40 m between two beds for human movement required for watering, weeding, and so on (Figure 1.14).

It is very useful if only limited space is available and also if we want to produce seedlings on a large scale. Use trays with appropriate sized cells – small cells for delicate seedling while larger ones for bigger seedlings. Cocopeat is generally used in seedling trays as a growing media. In case seedling trays are not available, you can use coconut shells, old teacups or similar waste materials. Figure 1.15: Seedling tray with saplings growing in them"}
{"id": "class 7__vocational education__p41__c1", "text": "19 Plant Nursery Did you know? Growing media has an advantage over soil in better management of moisture around roots. It also helps in avoiding disease spread and provides nutrients for growth. Apart from cocopeat, minerals like vermiculite and bentonite are used in plant nurseries as growing media. For sowing seeds in a seedling tray: 1. Soak cocopeat in water – 1 kg cocopeat can absorb 5–8 litres of water. 2. After all the water is soaked, fill the trays with the soaked cocopeat gently. 3. Sow seeds (1–2 seeds per hole) and cover the tray with tarpaulin sheet or gunny bags. Keep the covered tray(s) aside for 2–3 days. 4. Once the seeds start germinating, the tray should be placed in a shade-net nursery for further growth. After completing the activity, answer the following questions: 1.

Beyond domestic and farm animals, several other animals share our surroundings, including crows, sparrows, pigeons, owls, kites, bats, monkeys, langurs, squirrels, mice, rats, butterflies, and moths. They lead their busy lives alongside us, adapting to the human-dominated environment. Have you ever wondered where these animals lived before towns and cities replaced farmland and forests? How many of them have managed to adapt to the changes brought about by human expansion? As villages, towns, and cities continue to grow, natural habitats are shrinking, forcing many animals into unfamiliar territories. This habitat loss has led to an increase in sightings of leopards, wolves, and even tigers in urban areas and farmlands. Imagine being suddenly displaced from your home, losing the safety and comfort it provides—this is the challenge these animals are now facing. Figure 2.2: Bird’s nest hanging from the roof of a veranda in a city Figure 2.3: White-throated Kingfisher can be seen on wires near water bodies or parks in cities Animals that can adapt to changes in their habitat continue to coexist with us, while those that cannot retreat into the remaining untouched areas. Take birds, for example—specifically pigeons. Their natural habitat consists of cliffs and rocky hills, which is why they are commonly seen perched on building ledges. In contrast, house sparrows prefer sheltering in dense trees and bushes. As cities expand and green spaces diminish, the sparrow population gradually declines until they eventually disappear from urban landscapes."}
{"id": "class 7__vocational education__p49__c1", "text": "27 School Habitat Garden All animals require food and water to survive. Additionally, they need sufficient space to move freely and a safe shelter where they can rest and raise their young ones without fear of predators or exposure to harsh weather conditions. These four essentials— space, shelter, food, and water—form the foundation of every animals’s habitat. However, the specific needs of different animals vary. For instance, in terms of space, carpenter ants can establish a colony within just a few square centimetres, whereas spiders spin webs that are much larger than themselves. Similarly, water sources differ—while butterflies and ants can sip dew droplets from grass, birds often drink from puddles or leaking taps. Shelters also vary; squirrels find safety in trees, while lizards are comfortable on flat concrete surfaces, as few predators can climb walls to reach them. Near human settlements, a diverse range of food is readily available, including human leftovers, flower nectar, leaves, insects, and small animals (Figure 2.4). Additionally, birds find various materials for nest-building in such areas. They collect twigs, dried vegetation, and grass to construct sturdy nests (Figure 2.5). For the nest lining, sparrows often use feathers or even paper, whereas crows incorporate metal wires and ropes to reinforce their nests. Figure 2.4: Insect feeding on nectar of a flower, also helps in the pollination Figure 2.5: A bird gathering material for its nest Once basic needs are fulfilled, habitats must also provide comfort and joy. For example, some birds like bulbul, dove and munia love to bathe in shallow water containers to cool down and clean their feathers."}

These are just a few examples among the many protected areas across the country. The term ‘sanctuary’ literally means ‘a safe place where one’s needs are met.’ In the context of wildlife conservation, sanctuaries are typically vast, well-maintained areas managed by experts who ensure the protection and well-being of various species. However, the concept of a sanctuary is not limited to large-scale conservation efforts alone. Even a small habitat garden in your backyard or neighbourhood can serve as a miniature sanctuary, providing shelter, food, and a safe space for birds, butterflies, insects, and other small animals. By creating and nurturing such spaces, individuals can contribute to biodiversity conservation and support local wildlife in their own surroundings. What will I be able to do?

Activity 2: Interaction with an expert To assess the need of the animals identified by you, it will be useful to speak to an expert. The expert can be a farmer, gardener or any other community member who has a garden and an interest in animals. If possible, you can also meet a naturalist (who gains understanding of the natural world through observation over a long period of time), conservationist (who explains the need for protection of animals and give suggestions), zoologist (who studies animal behaviour), entomologist (who concentrates on insects), lepidopterist (who concentrates on butterflies and moths among insects), botanist (who studies plants), and any scientist who studies the natural world. Think of questions to ask the experts. Some questions are given below, you can think of many more. 1.

{"id": "class 7__vocational education__p55__c1", "text": "33 School Habitat Garden Did you know? Fireflies are a species of insects that emit light. A few decades back, entire trees used to be lit up by small lights in some areas of our country, but this is rare now (Figure 2.8). Fireflies live in various habitats but are mostly found in humid, warm environments. Many species thrive in forests and fields or the area between them. As forests and fields are replaced by houses and human population, fireflies are no longer found in the area. Also, as light pollution increases, fireflies cannot signal to each other. This disrupts their life cycle, and the population of fireflies decreases. Thus, fireflies have not been able to adapt into their changed habitat. This poses a serious problem for farmers in these areas. Fireflies are very important for farmers since they feed on insects that harm crops. As their population decreases, farmers have to use chemicals to protect their crop, which in turn has harmful effects on plants and those who consume these plants. Figure 2.8: Fireflies Identification using apps You can use mobile applications to identify birds, butterflies and other insects. Some useful applications are:  Seek by iNaturalist (App): Helps identify insects, butterflies, birds, and animals through image recognition.  PlantNet (App): Helps identify local plant species and understand their importance in conservation.  eBird: Used for logging bird sightings and contributing to a global citizen science database.  Merlin Bird ID (App): Used for identifying bird species by sound or image.  Picture Insect (App): Used for insect identification."}

Some birds like the house sparrow rub their feathers with dry earth or sand while vigorously wriggling their bodies and flapping their wings. This causes dust to fly up and then fall through their feathers. Birds do this to remove any tiny insects that may have crept into their feathers and to clean their skin. This is known as dustbathing (Figure 2.10a). 2. Birds take water baths in a similar manner, by wriggling their bodies and flapping their feathers. They are happy to do this in rainwater or in a shallow pool. They do this to clean their feathers and to ensure they are well-maintained for flying (Figure 2.10b). 3. Butterflies also gather around puddles, damp soil or animal droppings. This is known as mudpuddling (Figure 2.10c). They do this to absorb nutrients and also water.

Add spaces for mudpuddling, basking, dustbathing, water baths, feeders, and all the plant and non-plant elements in your garden. This visual plan will help you as a guide to actually create the habitat garden (Figure 2.11). Refer to the Activity 1, where you had identified some animals you would not like in your habitat garden.

You can make these using waste plywood or bamboo with some help from your teacher. The size of the entrance should match the birds you expect (e.g., small for sparrow, large for owl). \u0007 Similarly, you must have seen birds drinking and bathing in shallow containers filled with water placed by humans. You can use any discarded container to provide water to birds. Just remember to keep them at a height so they are safe from cats or dogs. 2. \u0007Waste puddles and feeders for butterflies: Butterflies, on the other hand, do not like very deep water. For them, you can fill water containers with stones or pebbles, and sand. Add a pinch of salt and compost as well to provide nutrients. Ensure that this puddling area is always kept moist. \u0007 A butterfly feeding area can be created just like feeding areas are created for birds; both need to be at a height but the one for butterflies has to be smaller. For birds, you can put out grains and seeds, while for butterflies you can put out rotting fruit or a sponge soaked in sugar syrup. \u0007 For butterfly shelters you can make narrow and tall wooden boxes with slits instead of holes so that butterflies can enter but birds cannot. These boxes should be placed high above the ground in a place sheltered by winds. 3. \u0007Shelter for beneficial insects: For insects like ladybugs and beetles, you can create a shelter with natural materials like logs, straw, pinecones, and bricks. Simply stack these materials in layers within a wooden frame or crate. Ensure there are small gaps and crevices for insects to nest. Place these shelters near flowering plants or a compost pit, in case there is one in your school. This shelter should be placed 1–3 feet above the ground. \u0007 Wooden logs, dead tree branches, and compost heap with dry leaves attract beetles, ants and similar insects. These can be placed in the corner of the habitat garden. Activity 6: Creating the habitat garden Now that the design is ready, start planting the habitat garden! The sequence of steps to be followed are given below: 1. Mark the area in the place you have identified. If land is not available, pots or planting boxes can be used."}

By carefully designing and nurturing it, you have created a “self-sustaining environment” that mimics a natural habitat. As plants grow and bloom, they naturally attract various insects and animals, creating a balanced ecosystem. Flowering plants draw butterflies and small birds, while birds help control insect populations by feeding on them. The presence of insects also invites spiders, bats, lizards, and insects, which play their role in the “food chain”. Over time, these smaller creatures attract larger birds, which will add to the “biodiversity” of your garden. Your habitat garden can now become a haven for animals, a beautiful green space, and a step towards ecological conservation. Figure 2.17: Habitat garden in a school with a nest and a bird house Activity 7: Observing occupants of the habitat garden Allow your habitat garden time to grow and flourish.

Taking care of the habitat garden is important to ensure it continues to attract animals you want. You also need to take care of plants, and ensure there are no unwelcome occupants. For example, you need to water the plants, ensure there is no stagnant water to prevent mosquitoes, clear fallen leaves and stems from pathways (you can collect them and put them in a compost bed). Therefore, you must prepare a maintenance schedule for the habitat garden. You can divide yourselves into small teams and distribute the work. You must rotate the tasks so that everybody gets a chance to contribute. You can prepare a maintenance chart and keep a checklist to ensure tasks are done on time.

As communities migrate, they continue their traditional work even as they become part of the local community already living in the area. One such community, which migrated from Gujarat many centuries India has a rich history of textiles, with each state having its own traditional ways of weaving cloth and creating beautiful patterns using different methods, like dyeing, embroidery and printing. Some of these weaves and patterns have been used across centuries. Among these methods is tie and dye, e.g., Lehariya, Bandhani (Figures 3.1 and 3.2). Bandhani, which literally means ‘to bind or tie’, is a resist dye technique. Resist dye techniques prevent dye from colouring some parts, so that it retains the original colour. Thus, it creates beautiful patterns. Figure 3.2: Bandhani patterns can be created to create intricate designs In the Bandhani method, fabric is folded, tied, twisted, and bound to prevent certain portions from being coloured. Artisans practising this method tie the fabric so that circles, spirals, stripes, and even patterns that appear like plants and animals are created. Bandhani is also known as tie and dye, and is generally practised in Rajasthan and Gujarat. Usually done on cotton, silk, and wool, traditional Bandhani is created using natural dyes made of plants and spices."}

While most of these immigrants got involved in weaving silk, those in Madurai introduced what came to be called the Madurai Sungudi — cotton tie and dye material, generally used for sarees. Thus, tie and dye came to be associated with Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Tamil Nadu too. Another popular resist dye method is wax resist where wax or a starchy paste is applied either freehand or using blocks/stencils, which have patterns carved on them. These patterns can be geometric, or in the shape of animals or plants. This is known as batik, and has traditionally been practised in Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Rajasthan. Bandhani is among the oldest tie and dye techniques. The earliest evidence of Bandhani is found in the Ajanta caves in Maharashtra where paintings show a woman wearing a dotted cloth that is believed to be Bandhani (Figure 3.3). Bandhani is not merely an Indian art form, it also reflects the rich culture of our country. Different colours and styles of Bandhani are associated with different communities and worn with pride in both Rajasthan and Gujarat (Figure 3.4). In some communities, different types of Bandhani are associated with different rituals. Since tie and dye products are created by hand, and no two artisans will tie the fabric in the same way, no two pieces are alike. Thus, each pattern is unique. This project will help you create your own unique tie and dye product.

Prepare natural dyes using vegetables, fruits, spices and plants. 2. Design patterns for tie and dye. 3. Use tie and dye to create colourful patterns on recycled fabrics. 4. Prepare a product using tie and dye. What will I need? You will need different kinds of tools and materials before you start working: Tools and Materials required 1. Fabric: Fabric used for Bandhani must be strong since it has to undergo multiple rounds of tying and dyeing. Hence, fabric made of natural fibres is used, e.g., cotton, silk, wool. You can use light coloured thin cotton fabric cut out of old clothes. If there are light-coloured linen or silk clothes that have been discarded at home, you can use them as well. You must ensure no traces of starch or dirt remain by washing the fabric carefully. 2. Material for tying: Thread for tying must be white or very light coloured. This is to avoid the colour from ‘bleeding’ from the thread, that is, to prevent the colour of the thread itself from dyeing the fabric. Rubber bands and clips can also be used if large portions are to resist the dye. Grains, pulses, seeds, small stones, peppercorns, etc., can be used to ensure that the area that resists the dye is of the desired size. 3. Material for dyeing and fixing: Natural dyes can be made using a variety of materials, e.g., beetroot, coffee, turmeric, red cabbage, pomegranate, henna, spinach,"}
{"id": "class 7__vocational education__p77__c1", "text": "55 Tie and Dye How do I keep myself and others safe? The following precautions need to be taken during various tasks involved in tie and dye techniques: 1. Wear gloves to protect your hands from warm dyes, and aprons to protect your clothes while using dyes. Use masks to avoid colour splashing on your mouth and prevent breathing in any vapour from the hot dye. Wear goggles to keep your eyes safe from hot water. 2. Work in a well-ventilated area so that smells and vapours do not irritate you. 3. Handle scissors with care while cutting fabric – never point the scissors towards yourself or anyone else. 4. Carefully dispose off any leftover dye solution in the sink. While using the dye, spread plastic sheets on the surface to prevent splashes and to keep the work area safe and clean. Internet safety: Seek help from your teacher while using the Internet. Be careful not to upload or download anything without checking. Do not share personal information anywhere. orange peels, onion skin and indigo. To ensure the colour of the dye does not wash out or fade too soon or bleed from your product onto other clothes (e.g., on a shirt you are wearing), you will need fixers. For example, salt/ vinegar is used to fix the dye when flowers or leaves are used. 4. Tools: Measuring cup/spoon, containers, burner/stove, stirrers, iron, mug, plates, scissors, tongs, glass, bowl. The nakhli or nakhlo (Figure 3.5) is a ‘ring’ made of metal with a protruding blunt edge used by artisans to pick the fabric. Figure 3.5: Nakhli used by artisans"}

Figure 3.6: Different samples of Bandhani Some other tie and dye techniques Two examples of popular shaped resist tie and dye techniques besides Bandhani are given below: 1. Leheriya: Made by folding and tying the fabric before dyeing. This results in a wave-like pattern. The word leher means ‘wave’. It represents the flow of water and greenery, which hold high significance in states like Rajasthan and Gujarat. 2. Shibori: Shibori is an ancient Japanese tie and dye technique. The word Shibori means to ‘wring, squeeze or press’. Traditional Shibori often used natural indigo dye, which changes colour from green to blue as the fabric reacts with air during drying."}

It will be useful to understand which fabrics and patterns are popular, and likely to sell. You can also compare the cost of tie and dye products with other products. One way to do this would be to visit a shop selling clothes. You could also interact with a local boutique owner or a fashion designer. Visiting a tie and dye workshop will help you to gain firsthand knowledge of the process. You could also invite an artisan to your school to give a demonstration. However, if it is not possible to get an artisan, even a person who does tie and dye as a hobby could be invited. It is quite possible that a tie and dye workshop is not present in the vicinity. In that case, you can visit a dyeing workshop to get an understanding of the process. Activity 1: Visit to a shop You will observe many types of products in the shop, made of different fabrics using different methods, like weaving, embroidery, dyeing, and so on (Figure 3.7). While in the shop, try to get a feel of different fabrics by touching them. See if you can find Bandhani/ Batik/Shibori or any other kind of tie and dye designs. Before the visit, think of the questions you would like to ask the shopkeeper. Some pointers are given in table 3.1 but please add to these. Get responses for at least five types of fabrics.

Activity 3: Exploring the art of tie and dye Before you make your product, you must practice and experiment with fabrics, dyes and designs. First, make some samples on a small piece of fabric. Step 1: Prepare the sample fabrics Get five handkerchief-sized (6 × 6 inches) fabrics. These fabrics could be from an old shirt, kurta, saree or anything that is not in use any more. You can use different kinds of fabric— thin cotton, thick cotton, silk, linen or any other fabric to see the difference in results. Remember to start with white or light-coloured fabrics so you can see your designs better. Figure 3.10 shows how the fabric is to be prepared.

{"id": "class 7__vocational education__p85__c1", "text": "63 Tie and Dye Step 2: Tying the fabric You have already read that when we tie the fabric, we prevent the part that has been tied from getting coloured by dye. This resisting of the dye creates patterns due to the difference between the parts that are dyed and not dyed. Tying the fabric in different ways will create different and unique design(s). Experts can tie and dye the same fabric multiple times to introduce colours in the patterns — this is done by dyeing the fabric multiple times, each time tying different parts of the fabric to get a different colour and pattern. However, we will stick to two colours — the original colour of the fabric and the colour of the dye. The technique for tying fabric for Bandhani, Shibori and Leheriya is given in figures 3.11 to 3.13, respectively. Bandhani tying technique Step 1: Draw a design on the fabric using tiny circles/dots. Step 2: Place a mustard seed on the fabric where you want the design element to appear. Pinch a small portion of the fabric around the seed using your fingers. Step 3: Pull the seed up with the fabric and tie it tightly with the thread. Repeat the process for the design you would like to create . Figure 3.11: Tying technique for Bandhani Traditionally, Bandhani patterns are given different names depending on the number of knots in the design. Larger designs are made by repeating these patterns. Some examples are given in table 3.3; try to make your own design using any of these."}

{"id": "class 7__vocational education__p87__c1", "text": "65 Tie and Dye Shibori tying technique Step 1: Draw the design on the fabric. You can draw the design either in a straight or dotted line. Step 2: Use a needle and thread to sew simple running stitches along the lines of your design. Make sure to keep even spacing for a neat pattern. Step 3: Continue stitching until your entire pattern is outlined with the running stitches. Keep the stitches loose, as they will be gathered later. Step 4: Gently pull the loose ends of the thread to gather the fabric, creating folds. The tighter you pull, the more distinct your design will be. Step 5: Once gathered, tie a firm knot at the end of the thread to hold the folds in place. Make sure it is tight, so the dye does not seep into the folded areas. You can vary the pattern by varying the length of the stitches, the angle of the lines, and where and how tightly you tie the thread. Figure 3.12: Tying technique for Shibori"}
{"id": "class 7__vocational education__p88__c1", "text": "66 Kaushal Bodh— Grade 7 Leheriya tying technique Step 1: Fold the fabric in half and find the centre point. This will help in creating symmetrical pleats. Step 2: Start making small, even pleats by folding the fabric back and forth like an accordion. Ensure the pleats are neat for a clean pattern. Step 3: Continue folding until the entire fabric is pleated. Hold the fabric firmly to maintain the folds. Step 4: Carefully hold the pleats and tie them tightly with thread at the centre. Ensure the knot is secure to keep the pleats in place. Step 5 : Tie the fabric at equal intervals on both sides of the centre. This will create the Leheriya pattern after dyeing. You can vary the design by decreasing or increasing the number of pleats, as well as the distance at which you tie the thread. Figure 3.13: Tying technique for Leheriya Now, you are ready to tie your first sample. First, think of a design, draw it on the fabric and then tie your first sample fabric. Do not tie and dye all samples together. Doing one sample at a time will help you improve your tying technique.

Making pink/red dye Step 1: To create a natural beetroot dye, start by chopping or crushing two medium-sized beetroots. This helps effective release of colour. Step 2: Add the crushed beetroot to 1 L of water and let it slowly boil for about 1 hour. This process extracts the rich red pigment from the beetroots. Step 3: Once the mixture has cooled down, strain the liquid using a cotton cloth or a strainer to remove any solid pieces, leaving only the coloured liquid. Step 4: Finally, add one to two tablespoons of salt to the dye solution. This acts as a fixer, and helps set the colour, making it more effective for dyeing fabric. Your natural beetroot dye is now ready to use. The quantity of the plant (vegetable/flower/fruit) and water will depend on the shade of colour needed and the weight of the fabric — the darker the shade and the heavier the fabric, the more quantity is required.

{"id": "class 7__vocational education__p106__c1", "text": "84 Kaushal Bodh— Grade 7 What do we mean by intelligence? Intelligence is the ability to learn and to use what you have learnt in new situations. Intelligence keeps growing – the more we deal with new situations, the more our intelligence grows. With advances in technology, machines are also becoming intelligent, just like humans. This is known as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and it is progressing very rapidly – what we did not imagine even a few years back is possible now (Figure 4.1). Before learning about AI, let us discuss how we learn. Imagine that, on the first day of school, you meet many new people. Your brain will try to remember their faces and names, but you may not be able to remember all of them. After few meetings and interactions, your brain will start recognising each person and recalling their names as soon as you see them. After few days of interaction, you will be able to recall many qualities of that person. AI works in a similar way. For example, if we want a machine to recognise an image, we need to show different images of the same object. We do this by uploading these images with proper instructions. Suppose, we want a machine to recognise a banyan tree. We will upload many different images — banyan tree in the shade, in light, different stages of growth (including many pictures of saplings), from different angles, in different geographies, full photos, partial photos — this will have to be done carefully to ensure the machine has maximum possible data related to how a banyan tree looks. We also need to teach the machine to associate images with their name — in this case, ‘banyan tree’. Slowly, as you upload more data and associate it with the name, the machine will start recognising images, even those it has never seen before and connect them to the correct name. You can even teach the machine to connect to other information related to the banyan tree. In this way, you can keep adding the connections the machine can make — e.g., scientific name, conditions for growth, uses, animals who live in it, and whatever else may be useful for humans. This process is called ‘Machine Learning’, and AI makes it possible."}
{"id": "class 7__vocational education__p107__c1", "text": "85 AI Assistant Similarly, you can teach the machine to recognise audio recordings of music and sounds — e.g., with a different tone, using different musical instruments — and video recordings — e.g., different backgrounds, different angles. AI is being used in various ways to help humans. AI can be used to automate repetitive tasks, thus, reducing human efforts and increasing productivity. As its use increases, and scientists and engineers explore how it can be expanded, it is fast becoming a part of our everyday lives. Right now, we use AI without even thinking of it. Various apps for navigation while driving, image recognition, translation, and so on are part of our lives. You may have heard of robots that help doctors operate from a city far away from the patient, or robots who can teach students. Till few years back, some of these functions of AI were part of science fiction books and films. And now they are fast becoming a reality. Even though AI may keep learning by itself, as it gathers more information there are certain things it cannot do. For example, can we teach AI to feel emotions? AI may be able to identify various aspects of nature that make it beautiful, but it will be able to convey that an artwork makes you feel good only when you train it to do so – it will never be able to feel emotions as humans do. What will I be able to do? At the end of the project, you will be able to: 1. Understand how AI can be a useful tool for humans. 2. Collect data that can be used to create an AI Assistant. 3.

Before you start, you should know basic functions on the computer, and how to use the Internet. You should be able to take photographs and upload them. But, before you begin, the first thing you must do is to understand what AI can and cannot do. Once you understand this, you will be able to make decisions about what the AI Assistant should do. Activity 1: Human vs Machine: Who is Better at What? Start by exploring three tasks related to what makes humans and machines special, and discovering how both work. 1. The speed with which a machine and you can calculate: Speed Test. You can do this using pen and paper, and a calculator. You can use a watch or borrow your teacher’s smartphone to keep track of time. 2. Check how accurately a machine can guess what you have drawn: The Creative Guessing Game. Use ‘Quick Draw’ or a similar drawing game. Draw and let the computer guess what it is. 3. Compare who can better guess the time taken to reach school: The Prediction Test. Think of how long it usually takes to reach school. Pick any date and predict how long you will take to reach school. Now, ask Google Maps how long it will take. Compare the predictions. You can search for more apps on the Internet with these keywords: z Apps + drawing recognition z Apps + navigation"}

They can guess accurately when sufficient information is available but may not be able to guess accurately if they need more information. Do you agree? Discuss among yourselves. Activity 2: AI can see, listen and speak AI can help people see, listen and speak – after it has been taught to do so. For example, modern hearing aids for people with hearing loss use AI to suppress unwanted noises and amplify other sounds. Thus, a person can hear human speech clearly while the background noise fades into the background. AI can even improve the quality of what is spoken. Some AI tools can distinguish between different speakers, so that the user can follow conversations correctly. Thus, AI can listen. Did you know? Prof. Stephen William Hawking was a famous scientist, who made many important discoveries about the universe. But what was unique about him was that he was suffering from an illness from the age of 21 years that led to slow paralysis of his entire body. Gradually, he lost the ability to speak. However, Prof. Hawking used AI to communicate. Initially, he used a system that helped him select words on a computer screen by tracking movements of his cheek muscles. The words he selected were converted to speech. Figure 4.3: Prof. Stephen Hawking AI can help people with visual impairment through AI enabled glasses with sensors that can detect light and images. Thus, AI can see. AI can also use recordings of people who have lost their voice to help them speak even if they are unable to do so themselves."}

Everything is new, especially if you have moved to another district or state. You need to learn about the places to eat, to buy something you need, local customs, places of historic interest, and so on. Along with useful information, you would also like to know what makes that place special. So, if you had to help someone who has moved into your locality, what would you tell them? Discuss among your friends what are the most important things to know about your locality. You could ask someone who recently moved into the neighbourhood, a community elder, your parents and teachers for their views. Few examples of different categories you can find out about are given below. ‘Sub-categories’, that is, specific examples of each of the categories are given in the brackets: 1. Popular food in the locality (e.g., different kinds of food, drink, fruits, snacks). 2. Plants that grow in the locality (e.g., trees, flowering plants, bushes, shrubs, vegetables, farm crops). 3.

{"id": "class 7__vocational education__p117__c1", "text": "95 AI Assistant While you can decide whether you want to collect data for all the categories, different groups of students can take responsibility for different categories, so that you collect a lot of information. Preferably, you should collect data with the help of a camera, but if for some reason you are unable to do so, search for relevant images on the Internet. The first step in making the AI Assistant is to collect different kinds of data related to the same object. To understand how to do so, take the example of Aisha. Aisha’s mother is a fruit seller, and Aisha wants to help her sort the varieties of mangoes while purchasing them from the market. She decides to use AI by training her ‘machine’ to sort different types of fruits, especially the many varieties of mangoes. Table 4.4: Training the machine to sort mangoes Category Mango Sub-category Alphonso Himsagar Malgova Raspuri Add Image Data As a first step Aisha collects data in the form of images of different kinds of mangoes she is interested in. Data is any type of information that we can see, hear, or record. It can be in many forms, like words, numbers, pictures, sounds, or even videos. For this project, we will focus on Image Data; you can decide to take up Audio Data and Video Data if you wish. You can do this by making your own AI Assistant using a computer/tablet/smartphone.

For example, if a prompt is related to plants, the AI Assistant must pull out the right data. You can search online for different ‘machine learning models for image recognition’.

Storytelling has been prevalent from ancient times and different forms of storytelling have evolved over time. The paintings in the Ajanta caves in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar in Maharashtra, made between the second century BCE and fifth century CE, are one form of storytelling—they depict stories from the Jataka tales through paintings. India also has a tradition of oral storytelling, which has continued until today, through Baul songs in Bangla, Dastangoi in Urdu, Katha in different languages, Kavad in Rajasthan, Yakshagana in Kerala and Karnataka, and Ram Leela across the country. Kavad is narrated using a wooden shrine that opens as the story unfolds. Yakshagana and Ram Leela use music, masks, and costumes, along with dialogues. Traditionally, these performances were done without a written script. Figure 5.2: Shadow puppet show uses light and the shadow of puppets to tell stories from our ancient epics The forms in which stories are told keep changing—for example, in modern times, writing is a popular form of storytelling. Along with writing, photography, cinema, animation, and many other forms are used for storytelling. Sadly, some of the traditional forms are not as popular as they were till a few decades back — some people prefer more modern forms of storytelling. But one form that has persisted is using puppets to tell stories (Figures 5.1 and 5.2). Puppets are human or animal figures that can be moved by the puppeteer. Therefore, a clockwork doll will not be considered a puppet but a simple sock with eyes, nose, and mouth stitched"}

Puppetry is the art of moving puppets either by hand, rods or strings to narrate a story. You may have already learnt about puppets in Art Education. You might have also learnt about the different kinds of puppets used in our country. The advantage of puppetry is that you can put up a show with even one or two humans and a few puppets. This show can be easily taken from place to place and used to narrate a variety of stories. Puppet shows have been used to share sensitive social messages that people may hesitate to discuss otherwise or even to involve people who may otherwise stay aloof. Since the puppet, and not the human is speaking, the audience will listen and laugh about things that would otherwise make them angry or upset. For example, puppets have been used to discuss addiction, superstition and other ills in society. They have been used to motivate people to act against injustice. Did you know? Between 2012 and 2014, archaeologists excavated a site belonging to the Sindhu–Sarasvati civilisation at Karanpura in Rajasthan, situated along the river Chautang. Among the many discoveries was what appeared to be a puppet- headed bull (Figure 5.3). Although its head is missing, archaeologists have observed that the shape of the artefact is such that a detachable head could be placed on it. There are also two shallow grooves through which a string could be passed to make the head move. Figure 5.3: Puppet headed bull"}

Discuss the types of puppets with the puppeteers. Observe the puppet’s mechanism—how the puppeteer moves it, who he/she looks at, their dress, style of holding the puppet and most importantly, voice modulation. If it is a live performance or a play with human actors or a puppet show, observe the stage arrangement, background, sound and light. After watching the puppet show, please respond to the following questions: 1. What was the name of the puppet show?

The first step towards putting up a puppet show is to identify a story and write a script. Once that is done, you have to make puppets according to the characters in the story and then design the puppet show. Finally, you have to set up the stage and put up a show."}
{"id": "class 7__vocational education__p138__c1", "text": "116 Kaushal Bodh— Grade 7 Activity 3: Selecting/writing a story Before you start making puppets, you should be clear about the story you want to present. You can go to the school library and read books to get ideas. Or you can use something you are learning about in other subjects, e.g., a story or poem from language or a historical event in science or social science. You can also select a story your grandparents tell you. Alternatively, you can think about designing a puppet show around social issues, e.g., Swachh Bharat, polio vaccination or on the rights and responsibilities of citizens. Remember, you have to make puppets, write a script and put on a show. Therefore, your story must be short and simple, but with some drama and/or action in it. Which story did you select and why? .............................................................................................................. .............................................................................................................. .............................................................................................................. Next, you need to identify the key elements of the story. Table 5.1 will help you in doing so.

Where is the story set?"}

Write the sequence of the main events. What is the central message of the story? Activity 4: Writing a script for the puppet show When you see a live performance or watch a film, there are dialogues, changes in scenes, music, action, and many other things. It is much more than just narrating a story. Translating a story into a show is done using a script. A script has the step-by-step flow of scenes, dialogues and emotions of the characters. It also contains details, like the position and movement of the puppet(s) during each scene. Elements like short songs or poems, light and sound effects, and so on must be mentioned in the script. The style of speaking has to be made clear, e.g., natural, casual, formal, authoritative, submissive, and so on depending on the character and the scene. Try and select a story that has at least 2–3 characters. These characters can be animals, humans, aliens – as per the story. To help you understand how to write the script, an example of a story called ‘Gopal and the Hilsa Fish’ is given in Table 5.2. This story is about a king who does not like people talking about the Hilsa fish in the court. He challenges Gopal, his courtier, to buy a huge Hilsa fish and bring it to the palace without anyone talking about it. Gopal accepts the challenge. He shaves half his beard and smears ash on himself. People are so surprised by his appearance that they do not talk about the big Hilsa fish in his hand."}

Would they be outgoing or shy? These are known as characteristics. Deciding the characteristics of your puppet is known as making a character sketch. This is necessary for deciding the face and body of the puppet, its expression, its voice, and mannerisms, for example, jumping up and down when Please note that props are objects other than puppets (Figure 5.4) used on stage. They are used to clearly show the setting (e.g., the king’s throne) and can easily be moved around (e.g., Hilsa fish, sword, ball, car, newspaper). While some of these are placed on the stage, others can be moved around if attached to a string or stick. Figure 5.4: Puppet for Gopal from ‘Gopal and the Hilsa Fish’"}

You can draw a rabbit on paper and paste it on cardboard. You can then attach a stick to the cardboard to move your rabbit puppet. To draw the rabbit, take a picture of a rabbit, tracing paper and graph paper. Draw the rabbit on the tracing paper and paste it on the graph paper. Next, draw lines proportionate to the graph on the chart paper you want to draw the rabbit on – this will help you make a larger rabbit. You can now copy each part of the rabbit onto the chart paper. Erase the lines once you are done and colour your rabbit (Figure 5.6). Once the stick is pasted to the body of the rabbit, your puppet is ready. 1. 2. 3. 4. Figure 5.6: Making a rabbit with graph paper excited, slumping when sad (Figure 5.5). You need not make the puppet exactly like an animal or human figure – often, puppets have elongated bodies, arms and hands.

Now you are ready to prepare for the show. Activity 7: Puppet show Start rehearsing with the puppets. Make sure everyone is clear about their responsibilities to ensure a great show. Some of you can be puppeteers, others can give light and sound effects, and can change the backdrop as the scenes change. There might be other things that need to be done based on your story. It is extremely important to have the following elements to have a great puppet show: a. Stage The space where the show is performed, is very important. First, there must be scope to create a ‘stage’ so that the audience can clearly see the puppets. Second, there must be space for the audience to sit. There are different ways to set a stage (Figures 5.21 to 5.23). Figure 5.21: A bedsheet covering a table is used as a stage. The bedsheet will hide the puppeteer, who can move the puppets using their hands or sticks attached to the puppets’ bodies."}

In case the puppeteer uses strings, the sheet can be tied to a string behind the table like a curtain. Figure 5.23: A frame used as a stage for a puppet show. The frame should ideally be a rectangle (just like watching a film in the theatre). It can be made with different materials, but take care that the size of the ‘window’ is large enough for the puppets and their movement to be clearly visible. Remember, you need to keep the puppets which you will use for the show, close to the stage where the audience cannot see them. For example, you can keep the puppets behind the cloth used to cover the table. 1.

Briefly describe the backdrop(s) you have prepared. .............................................................................................................. .............................................................................................................. c. Props The kind of props will depend on how they are to be used. For example, we can use thick cardboard to create a chair, bed, or a throne, and so on. However, if the prop is being used or held by the puppeteer, it must be very light. Props can be made using simple materials, such as paper (e.g., newspaper, chapati), aluminium (e.g., sword, knife), cardboard or disposable containers (e.g., gas stove, plates) (Figure 5.25). 1. Briefly describe the props you have prepared. .............................................................................................................. .............................................................................................................. d. Voice Voice modulation plays an extremely powerful role in puppetry; the puppeteer acts through her or his voice. You must assign distinct voices to each puppet to differentiate the characters. For example, a lion puppet could have a deep, commanding voice, while a rabbit could have a high- pitched, playful voice. To make sure the audience understands what you are saying, speak clearly and loudly. Practice showing emotions, like happiness, fear, or excitement using voice Figure 5.25: A tree used as a prop to show that a monkey is plucking an apple from the tree. The monkey’s hand is moved using the stick attached to it."}

Refer the script you wrote. Try to do voice acting with puppets for dialogues. Practice playing sound or singing together wherever required. Practice is key for the success of your efforts. e. Sound and music You should have different types of sounds in the puppet show depending on the script – background music or sounds effects, like thundering of clouds before rain. You can use musical instruments or create sounds by tapping on the floor or the desk using a pencil, scale or your fingers. You can tap on a glass or bottle with different levels of water to create music for your show. You can experiment with different sound effect using the sound system; for example, whistling into a microphone creates the sound of the wind (Figure 5.26).

However, if the show is in a dark space, you need to plan the placement of lights. For example, you can use a torch behind curtains to show the moon, sun or a magic lamp. You can also use fairy lights, table lamps, earthen pots (diya), etc. Refer to your script (Table 5.3) to decide lighting effects and how you will generate them. g. Puppeteer The puppeteer needs to rehearse the dialogues well. Remember, the puppet is speaking, not you. You should also know when the puppet will enter the stage— ‘in’ and when to exit the stage — ‘out’. Secondly, the puppeteer should look at the puppet while the puppet talks to the audience. This means that as a puppeteer your face needs to be flat without emotions, so that the audience looks at the puppet and not at you. Activity 8: Putting up a puppet show Now, it is time for the show.

{"id": "class 7__vocational education__p164__c1", "text": "142 Kaushal Bodh— Grade 7 Did you know? These are some recommendations by health experts. Diet and Nutrition 1. Meal Frequency: Eating three main meals and 1–2 healthy snacks at consistent intervals prevents overeating or dips in energy. 2. Hydration: Drinking at least 6–8 glasses of water daily is essential for digestion, temperature regulation, and mental focus. 3. Eat home cooked food and limit eating processed food: Even a ‘simple meal’ like dal fry and rice ordered from outside may not be healthy since you are unsure of the amount of oil added or whether the dal is freshly cooked or stale. Therefore, limiting food ordered from outside, processed snacks (e.g., chips), sugary drinks, and fried foods is good for health. Sleep Pattern 1. Sleep duration varies by age. Ideally, about 9–11 hours of sleep is ideal for students aged 6-13, while about 8–9 hours of sleep is sufficient for adults. Children below the age of 5 require more than 11 hours of sleep. 2. Healthy body functioning is also determined by a regular sleep schedule (going to bed and waking up at the same time daily); this helps regulate the body’s internal clock. 3. Disruptions like noise, bright lights, or uncomfortable bedding can affect sleep patterns. 4. To go to sleep easily, avoid stimulating activities, like screen time, loud music, or heavy meals an hour before sleep. Physical Fitness 1. Lack of physical activity and a sedentary lifestyle can have a very harmful effect on body functions in the long run. 2. Consistency is key, so you should choose a physical activity that you like. It can be yoga, sports or a simple walk. Which factors can you do something about, and which are out of your control? .................................................................................................................... ...................................................................................................................."}
{"id": "class 7__vocational education__p165__c1", "text": "143 Family Health Handbook What do I have to do? You have identified factors that affect health and may have noted some questions. As you continue to work on your project, you will try and find answers to these questions. You will understand the needs of persons of different age groups and identify environmental factors around you that may affect health. You will also learn how to provide first-aid, and how to avail medical care. Finally, you will come up with an action plan to improve and maintain your and your family’s health. All this will be part of your family health handbook. Mental Well-being Just as our physical well-being can be affected by many factors, our mental well-being is also prone to being affected. For example, due to a fight with a friend, examination stress, concerns about family, or any other reason. Mental and physical well-being are interconnected, and both are equally important. Spending time with friends and family, and on productive activities, including games and sports, helps maintain mental well-being. You can learn more about family health and first-aid techniques by searching on the Internet. You can search using keywords, like family health, basic first-aid and steps, tips for family health and wellness, first-aid for common injuries, etc. Activity 2: Framing questions related to your and your family’s health Think about your and your family members’ health.

You should also have a first-aid kit at home as a part of your safety readiness plan. The first-aid activities you could focus on are: 1. Tying bandages for minor cuts (Figure 6.3). 2. First-aid for minor burns (Figure 6.4). 3. Preparing ORS during dehydration (Figure 6.5). Remember, first-aid is only emergency treatment before you take the patient to the doctor."}

Exploring components of the first-aid kit: Decide the contents that can be incorporated into the school first-aid kit. Brainstorm on possible injuries and health issues which might occur on school premises and what components will be required. 3. Organising and labelling the components of the first-aid kit. 4. Making the first-aid kit: The components you have selected must be placed in a wide metal container or a small bag with pockets. You may make separators using cardboard or place the components in smaller boxes or bags to ensure you can find them easily, if needed. The box or bag must have the label ‘first-aid kit’. 5. Demonstration and practice of use: Make notes while experts demonstrate basic procedures, such as applying bandages for cuts, treating minor burns, dehydration, fever, etc. Practice once with the support of the expert. 6. Deciding where to place the first-aid kit: The first-aid kit should be kept in an easily accessible place on the school premises, but out of reach of the younger students. Figure 6.6 shows the components of the first-aid kit. What else do you think could be required? While emergencies can happen despite our best efforts, some illnesses can be avoided by taking what is called ‘preventive action’. This means that care must be taken to ensure nutrition and diet, sleep, physical fitness, mental well-being, and environment so that people stay as healthy as possible.

You may have noticed that babies eat and sleep a lot, and elderly people like to rest in the afternoon. To identify specific needs of your family members, you must understand the factors affecting health at different ages. Each family is different, e.g., some families have parents and one or more children, some are joint families with many generations living in the same house, some are only made up of one parent and a child – many variations are possible. However, most of us will have people of all ages in our extended families, or family friends of different ages. With this in mind, collect and document basic health data and some observations related to daily routine for the following age groups: (i) Below 5 years, (ii) 6–18 years, (iii) 19–30 years, (iv) 31–45 years, (v) 46–60 years, (vi) above 60 years. Even if you do not have a family member from any of these age groups, you can collect information from a relative/neighbour/friend. You can make separate sections for every age group using 3–4 sheets, or as required, for each member in your handbook. Few examples of questions you can ask are given in table 6.1. Add to these questions as per your need. All questions may not be relevant for particular persons; you may skip those.

You may have shared something with other students and teachers during classroom presentations or during school assembly. You can also invite your family and other people to come and see your work. You can do this through the Kaushal Mela. But first, you must plan each detail carefully. Planning is important since it helps you decide how to reach your goal. You must think about what need to be done and when it needs to be done so that everything goes smoothly. For example, if you are putting up a puppet show, you need to decide when and where keeping in mind that the maximum number of people watch it. Planning also helps to prevent wastage of time and resources. For example, if you want to demonstrate the tie and dye process, you must ensure all the materials are available in one place in the right quantity. Since the Kaushal Mela will involve a lot of planning and coordination, you must plan each detail carefully. Responsibilities must be assigned for each activity, and the process for each activity discussed in detail. You must also develop a plan to work together as a team.

Therefore, students should reflect on what they have learnt from others. It can help improve their soft skills, deepen their understanding, and enhance the project’s overall success. Engaging with others enables students to communicate effectively, share ideas, and collaborate on tasks. Diverse perspectives and ideas are introduced, which help students learn from the viewpoints of others. This can help them approach problems in new ways, and enhance their creativity and problem- solving skills. Listening to others, such as workers in the world of work, experts, professionals, and the like provides valuable insights that can help improve learner’s practices. Students must be able to identify what they learnt during field trips, online and offline interactions with experts, from family and friends, community members, and other sources. They must be able to respond to the following questions: 1. What did you learn from field trips, interactions, video lectures, or experts? 2. What did you learn from your friends? Did you help them with something? 3. What did you learn from family members, siblings, and community elders? 4. What did you learn from people in the community? What did I do and how long did it take? In order to develop the capacity for time-based planning, students must record the entire process followed, the sequence of activities, and the time taken for each activity. This can be done as they proceed or at the end of the project. Students must be able to respond or think back on what they did and how long it took them to plan and execute the activities. What else can I do? Students need to think of other setting, in which they can apply their learning from the projects, especially outside the school.
