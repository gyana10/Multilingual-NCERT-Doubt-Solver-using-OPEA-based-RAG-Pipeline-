ICT has literally made inroads into almost all major disciplines across science, social sciences, languages, arts and medicine, etc. It has the potential to create newer avenues for employment, help us communicate and collaborate better, learn, and understand the nature and phenomena as well as improve our skills and standards of living. Policymakers across the globe today agree with the potential of ICT in the teaching-learning process and recommend ICT to be a part of school and teacher education curriculum. Rapid advancements in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) have created unprecedented opportunities in the field of education and school education in particular. Mastering ICT skills and utilising ICT is of utmost importance for teachers and learners for creating a new learning culture. ICT is stated to have motivational power. It enables students to enjoy learning as an active participant, such as by bringing the outside world into the classroom or by enhancing one‑to‑one, one-to-many and many-to- many interaction, among peers, teachers, experts and others. Furthermore, ICT has also helped the students in learning new skills, such as searching and locating appropriate information, making informed choices, learning to recognise the authenticity of sources and collaborating with other learners. Today, we are living in an interconnected world where ICT-based applications influence the way we learn, communicate, commute or even socialise. Developments in the twenty‑first century skills, such as communication, creative and critical thinking, problem solving, collaborative learning, etc., are essential at the school level. ICT plays a key role in developing these skills. This book aims to introduce the world of ICT and its applications. It will help students to learn, prepare, present and communicate their thoughts, ideas and content through various digital formats, i.e., text, image, audio and video, etc. The book will also help students to understand the potential of Internet as well as the safety and security issues related to it, and the ways in which one can safeguard themselves against malicious activities and incidents happening in the cyber world.

Also understanding the basics of ICT and mastering the skills is essential and must be regarded as a core part of education, along with reading, writing and numeracy. The recent efforts of the Government of India (GoI) seeks to deepen the use of ICT in almost every sphere of life. The Digital India Campaign (2015) strives to transform India into a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy by focussing on three vision areas — Digital Infrastructure as Core Utility to Every Citizen, e-Governance and Service on Demand and Digital Literacy and Empowerment of Citizens. The three cardinal principals of the draft New National Education Policy (2016) viz., access, equity and quality could be served well by harnessing the huge potential of ICT. The National Curriculum Framework (2005) recommends to recognise that given the space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. The curricula for ICT in education lays an emphasis on empowering the students in a way so that they may get an access to a variety of resources, learn to critically appraise information and resources, and make safe, productive, ethical and legal use of resources. The Present Class IX Textbook of ICT takes into account goals of the New Education Policy, the recommendations of National Curriculum Framework (2005), the Curricula for ICT in Education and visions of Digital India Campaign (2015). This textbook is an attempt to foster creativity, problem solving and to introduce students to the world of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), which may also shape their future career pursuits. The textbook contains eight chapters under four learning strands viz. 'Connecting with the World', 'Connecting with Each Other', 'Creating with ICT' and 'Interacting with ICT'. It has been carefully designed with meticulous efforts of the Textbook Development Team comprising School teachers, subject experts, academicians and technical experts from government, non-government and private entities. Some of the members worked at the advisory level while others contributed towards the actual development activity as core team members and members of the textbook development committee. It is hoped that the students will appreciate the immense potential of ICT and will be encouraged to explore and learn further.

The weight of the ball in every medium was noted by Muskan in her notebook. The weight was found to be least in water and comparatively higher in air than in mustard oil. Muskan recorded the entire experiment as a video, explaining about the variation of weight in various medium. Muskan shared this video with her classmates using a Messenger App. One of her friends suggested her to create a blog to share her experiences. Muskan created a blog and regularly shared her learning experiences and reflections on this blog. She also uses web tools and technology that made her learning experience very engaging. Muskan is excited about the potential of technology use for learning. This is only an example to describe how Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has started influencing the learning experiences. With the world becoming more and more digital with time, schools are also progressing in their use of ICT. In this chapter you will be introduced to the basic ideas of ICT and its uses in the learning process. What is ICT?

She is 14 years old and is a Table Tennis player. Her hobbies include singing, drawing, reading, dancing, gardening, etc. This is the description about Muskan available in her profile at school. Based on this information, Muskan's teacher selected her to participate in an inter‑school poster making competition‑on “Dance forms of India”. Thus information (meaningful data) can help in decision‑making also. The term communication may be referred as imparting or exchanging of information by speaking, writing, or using some other medium. In other words, it may be referred as conveying your feelings, thoughts and emotions in any verbal and non-verbal medium. Any communication has four essential elements, namely ‘sender’, ‘message’, ‘medium’ and ‘receiver’. When all four elements are in sync with each other in terms of sequence, relevance, appropriateness, etc., then communication becomes effective. Analyse the elements of communication followed when Muskan shared the video of experiment she recorded.

For example, Muskan went to an excursion to Bhubaneswar and visited the State Museum. She saw various mineral ores in the mineral section of the museum. She decided to capture photographs to share with others who may not have seen the ores. She borrowed her teacher’s mobile and clicked pictures of the rare collection. She shared all the pictures on her blog along with a description of the ores. Many viewers commented and appreciated Muskan for sharing those pictures and description. Technology can be used for creation and communication of information. The term Information and Communication Technology (ICT) includes various forms of technologies that are used to create, display, store, process, transmit, share or exchange information by electronic means (UNESCO 2007). Such a discipline which deals in the creation and communication of information is called ICT (see Fig.1.2). Radio, television, and print media (Newspaper, Books, Magazines, etc.) are the popular technologies used for communication.

Along with traditional radio, we also have online radio. Evolution of ICT We cannot live in isolation. We need to interact and communicate with each other and with our surroundings. In the ancient times people used smoke signals, drum sounds, pigeons and messengers as modes of communication. These were relatively slow, unreliable and sometimes unsafe means of communication. With the advent of new technologies, the modes and methods of communication are changing very fast. Radio, television, computers, telephones, smartphones, digital camera, laptop and interactive board have revolutionised the ways of communication. These are very fast and can link distant locations within no time. We can easily send messages across the globe and learn about events all over the world in a blink of eye. Numerous technological tools have come up which help us not only to communicate but to create, store and manage information. The diverse set of technological tools and resources used to store, manage, manipulate, create and communicate digital information come under information and communication technologies (ICTs).

It has become easier to communicate worldwide through the use of ICTs, for example, social media sites and apps, blogs, wikispace, etc. The use of ICT is time saving and cost effective in various ways. ICT has revolutionised the world. There was a generation that did not have telephone; there was a time when radio and television were considered as the most advanced sources of information. However now the new generation lives in the world of Internet, wireless, augmented and virtual space. The world around has drastically changed. The dramatic change due to ICT has resulted in innovation in every field. These innovations have reduced the size of the technological tools and increased the speed with which they operate to process data and communicate information. All these advancements and innovations give scope for betterment and effectiveness. Muskan has a cousin Nishi who lives in Bengaluru and who is also of her age. She has same hobbies like her, such as dancing and gardening. Both of them are very fond of each other. They like to talk very often, they discuss about new things they do in gardening for hours together over phone. But making phone calls frequently was very costly and unaffordable for them. Hence they always had to restrict their discussions on gardening. A friend of Muskan informed her about online video calling facility like Skype, Google Meet, etc., which is more cost effective than making, phone calls. Muskan installed Skype on her laptop and her cousin also installed it on her Smartphone. They are now able to discuss on several topics without any restriction. • Access to instant data: Access to instant data supports in predictions, decision making and also knowledge acquisition.

While packing, her mother was a little confused about carrying woollen clothes as she was unaware of the temperature in Mount Abu. Knowledge about ICT helped Muskan to help her mother. She checked the temperature in Mount Abu during the past few days from meteorological website. As the recorded temperature showed a higher temperature for past 15 days, she informed her mother to carry more semi woolen clothes. Instant access to data helped them to reduce the luggage and have a pleasant journey with required preparedness. ● Creation of information for communication: ICTs can be used to create communication pieces in various forms like text, image, audio, video, multimedia, etc. Once the information is in digital form it can be used for recreating resources out of the original. Digital information is also easy to modify and share. Muskan’s cousin Nishi visited a historical place ‘Hampi’ in Karnataka. When she saw the beauty of the architecture she thought of sharing it with Muskan. Nishi decides to show Muskan the archeological site through Skype, but her father suggested her to share it through Facebook live so that not only Muskan but her other friends can also see her exploration. As the mobile had a 4G network, the speed of the Internet supported online streaming. This act of Nishi helped Muskan to have a virtual trip to Hampi. She thought for a while and found a solution to make a great resource about Hampi that can be shared with others. So she downloaded the video shared by Nishi. Using a video editor, she edited the unwanted content, added a background music and shared it with her schoolmates who never saw Hampi. The knowledge of ICT helped in capturing the events Muskan herself had never seen and sharing them through online streaming. ● Store and organise: ICT helps in organising information in various forms.

Muskan's grandfather had a great collection of postage stamps. He gifted his collection to Muskan on her birthday. She was thrilled to get this collection but she observed that the collection compiled in an album will perish over time. She decides to give the collection a lasting life by converting it into a digital collection. She along with her brother scanned all the stamps and added tags like country to which they belonged, date of release, event, personality, phenomenon depicted on the stamp, etc. This digital storing and organising helped her to retrieve any stamp whenever she require and also to easily maintain the record. ● Scope for learning: ICT provides a great opportunity to learn. One can learn anytime, anywhere and at his or her own pace. We can also create our own personal learning environment. Availability of online courses, e-tutorials have opened up avenues for continuous and life‑long learning. Muskan used to visit her grandmother's place for every summer vacation, but this summer her parents were busy with some work. She could not visit her grandmother. She was very sad and did not know what to do during her summer vacations. Hasmukh, a friend, suggested her to do an online course on Puppetry. He sent her information about this free course. When she further searched about the course she found it to be a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC). As she was not aware of MOOC, she searched for information about MOOC and learnt that MOOCs are free online courses that can be taken up by anyone at anytime from anywhere. Muskan joined the course immediately and started learning different puppet‑making techniques as well as storytelling using puppets. She enjoyed the online course on puppetry and planned to do a puppet show in her class as a holiday project once the school reopens. ● Plan and manage : Use of ICT tools can help in time management by scheduling the works across devices and using various features like alerts, priorities, Reprint 2025-26"}

But you should remember that all the information available on the Internet cannot be guaranteed for quality or accuracy. So it is important to evaluate the resource or information. Keep in mind that anyone can publish anything they wish on the Web. It is often difficult to determine the ownership of the Web resources. So it is your responsibility to evaluate the resources effectively based on the following criteria: • Who has made the website and how to contact the website owner? • What is the website about? Is it commercial, educational, etc.? • Is the website for teachers or for students or for both? • Is the information reliable on the website? Always cross check the given information from other websites and other authentic sources like books, experts, etc. • Check whether the website offers free information or paid information? After gathering resources, it is time to make use of them for your event. You might have downloaded text, images, audio, videos related to your programme items.

{"id": "class 9__eng__p3__c1", "text": "FOREWORD THE National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that children’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy of Education (1986). The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge. These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience. The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in languages, Professor Namwar Singh and the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor R. Amritavalli for guiding the work of this committee.

The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the content load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative mindset. In this background, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise. Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following: • Content based on genres of literature in the textbooks and supplementary readers at different stages of school education • Content that is meant for achieving Learning Outcomes for developing language proficiency and is accessible at different stages • For reducing the curriculum load and examination stress in view of the prevailing condition of the Pandemic • Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions from teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-learning • Content, which is irrelevant in the present context This present edition is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes given above.

The curriculum calls for an approach that is rich in comprehensible input and adopts a language-across-the-curriculum, multilingual perspective. This reader aims at helping the child to read for meaning, and to learn to communicate in English with confidence and accuracy. Care has been taken to give a central place to the learner in the process of teaching and learning. Learner-friendly language has been used in the instructions, and the exercises and activities are addressed to the child. In this process the teacher is a facilitator or a co-learner. A rich variety of reading material has been provided to include the literary, cultural and sociological dimensions of texts. The themes range from childhood and adolescence, to disability, talent and achievement, to music, science, and contemporary social and environmental concerns. The range is as inclusive as possible, keeping in view the interest and cognitive development of the learners. The book draws on different genres such as story, biography and autobiography; science fiction; humour; travelogue; and the one-act play. The number of poems has been increased to help learners explore this great source of language, derive the joy of learning through poetry, and understand the music of words. An attempt has been made to include different types of poems such as the lyric, the ballad and the humorous poem. The poems have been chosen for their simplicity and suitability in terms of language and thought. We need not talk about the poet or the background to the poem, unless the poem seems to demand it. Nor should we attempt to exhaust all the possibilities of a poem; we should encourage the students to begin to see some of the possibilities. They should be guided to apprehend the poem through the visual, the auditory, the tactile, the intellectual, or the emotional channels, and to understand the suggestiveness of the images. An attempt has been made to help the learner develop the skill of predicting and anticipating what follows. Every good reader should guess what is coming next.

The section ‘Thinking about the Text’ attempts to move from surface level understanding of the text to critical thinking. The comprehension exercises given here try to help the learners infer meaning. There are a few questions which ask for the readers’ judgment; they aim to bring out the learners’ deeper understanding of the text. In the section ‘Thinking about Language’: • Vocabulary enrichment has been attempted through a variety of tasks on the usage of words closely related in meaning, matching words to meanings, word building (including phrasal verbs), and reference to the dictionary. An activity on the use of the index has been included. • Attention has been drawn to grammar-in-context that emerges out of the reading text, e.g. the use of the tenses and voice, reported speech, conditional and subordinate clauses or phrases, and adverbs. The communicative skills have been exercised by tasks on Speaking and Writing. The Speaking tasks call for learners to work in pairs or groups, (for example) to present an argument, express a viewpoint, express contrasts, seek or give an opinion, introduce a speaker, tell a story, enact or read out a play in parts, etc. There are a variety of writing tasks: help writing newspaper report, an article for a school magazine, argumentative writing, narration, description, and picture interpretation. A small attempt has been made to relate speech and writing by pointing out similarities and differences. Opportunities for writing in groups and pairs are provided to get into the task. We have introduced the old exercise of dictation again but from a completely different perspective. Dictation has been introduced in its current, updated form as a variety of activities designed to integrate the language skills of listening, prior reading, language processing and recall, and writing, including the appropriate use of punctuation in meaningful contexts. Some exercises also allow scope for the learners’ languages to support one another’s by asking for reflection on relevant words, or poems or stories in other languages; and attempt (preliminary as they may be) to attend to the process of translation. Activities have been suggested to bring out the relatedness of the learners’ school subjects. 2 / Beehive Reprint 2025-26"}

Let the children talk freely about how they imagine the schools of the future that their own children might go to. You might want to explain the ideas of ‘virtual reality’ and ‘virtual classroom’. The term ‘virtual reality’ refers to a reality created by computer software, and a ‘virtual classroom’ is not a real classroom but one where learning is through computer software or the Internet. The children may know what a robot is, and be able to guess what a robotic teacher would be. In this unit students are required to present their arguments in a debate. The following points could be explained before the task. • A debate is a contest between two speakers or two groups of speakers to show skill and ability in arguing. • A proposition, a question or a problem is required for this purpose, which can be spoken for or against. • To participate in a debate, one must prepare for it. So, one must prepare an outline of the main points in the order in which one is going to argue. • The time limit is about four to five minutes. • The speaker addresses the audience. • Every topic/subject has its own vocabulary. These must be learnt. • The speaker addresses the chair (Mr President/Madam), ‘submits’ an argument, ‘appeals’ for sympathetic understanding and support, ‘questions’ the opponent’s views, and ‘concludes’ an argument. 2. THE SOUND OF MUSIC These biographical pieces tell us of people who have achieved success and recognition through determination, hard work and courage. The children may be asked to think of potential barriers to success, and of people who have overcome them. The second part of the unit encourages students to think about the rich heritage of Indian music, and our musical instruments. The portraits of musicians given in the beginning may be supplemented by others that the children can be asked to bring to class. A comprehension exercise in Part II encourages children to find words in the text that express attitudes (positive, negative or neutral) to events, places, etc. Encourage the children to compare and discuss their answers. Dictionary entries give us different kinds of information about words. Children need help in using the dictionary to find specific kinds of information. Notes for the Teacher / 3 Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 9__eng__p14__c1", "text": "This unit has an exercise that asks students to consult a dictionary and find out which adjective can be used before a noun, which can be used after a verb, and which can be used in both ways. You may add some adjectives to those suggested. Encourage the children also to find more adjectives of the kinds mentioned. Students may wish to consult (in addition to the Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary), the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, the Collins Cobuild Advanced Learner’s English Dictionary, and the Word Master (Orient Longman), or any good dictionary of their choice. The Speaking exercise asks the students to imagine introducing a celebrity guest to an audience. It can be made an authentic activity if students are given a couple of minutes during the morning assembly to speak to their fellow-pupils about such a person. This would give them practice in facing an audience, and encourage them to prepare seriously, by: (i) noting down the important points about the person to be introduced, (ii) using appropriate phrases to introduce the person (students should be allowed to think what phrases they want to use). The Writing Task is an exercise in comparison. Hard work is a trait common to Evelyn Glennie (Part I, para 5) and Bismillah Khan (Part II, para 5). Help children identify the paragraphs that tell us about the two musicians’ goals. After they read and understand these parts of the text, they can organise the ideas in two paragraphs, one on each musician. 3. THE LITTLE GIRL The aim in this unit is to first read through the story at one go, not worrying about difficult words or difficult language. Students can read the story for homework and come to class; or the teacher can read out the story in class; or the students can read out parts of the story in the class, one after the other. Let them retell the story again, if necessary, in parts. The dictionary exercise in this unit shows how a very small common word can be used in different ways. Students might be interested in thinking about how they use words in their own language to express these meanings. They may also think of other words like same, small, give and take to convey different kids of meaning. Encourage them to consult a dictionary. This is a story about the changing attitude of a girl child towards her father. The Speaking and Writing exercises encourage the students to think about the relationship between children and parents. The students should be encouraged to say or write what they think, and not what the teacher thinks they should say or write. The aim is not to arrive at a ‘correct’ answer, but to let every child voice an opinion and express her/his ideas. It is hoped that children will find the topic of personal relevance. This will help their ideas and language to flow freely. 4 / Beehive Reprint 2025-26"}

When you’re through with the book, you just throw it away, I guess. Our television screen must have had a million books on it and it’s good for plenty more. I wouldn’t throw it away.” “Same with mine,” said Margie. She was eleven and hadn’t seen as many telebooks as Tommy had. He was thirteen.

What’s there to write about school? I hate school.” Margie always hated school, but now she hated it more than ever. The mechanical teacher had been giving her test after test in geography and she had been doing worse and worse until her mother had shaken her head sorrowfully and sent for the County Inspector. 4. He was a round little man with a red face and a whole box of tools with dials and wires. He smiled at Margie and gave her an apple, then took the teacher apart. Margie had hoped he wouldn’t know how to put it together again, but he knew how all right, and, after an hour or so, there it was again, large and black and ugly, with a big screen on which all the lessons were shown and the questions were asked.

I think the geography sector was geared a little too quick. Those things happen sometimes. I’ve slowed it up to an average ten-year level. Actually, the overall pattern of her progress is quite satisfactory.” And he patted Margie’s head again. Margie was disappointed. She had been hoping they would take the teacher away altogether. They had once taken Tommy’s teacher away for nearly a month because the history sector had blanked out completely. So she said to Tommy, “Why would anyone write about school?” 6. Tommy looked at her with very superior eyes. “Because it’s not our kind of school, stupid. This is the old kind of school that they had hundreds and hundreds of years ago.” He added loftily, pronouncing the word carefully, “Centuries ago.” Margie was hurt. “Well, I don’t know what kind of school they had all that time ago.” She read the book over his shoulder for a while, then said, “Anyway, they had a teacher.” loftily: in a superior way slot: a given space, time or position geared (to): adjusted to a particular standard or level They had a teacher...

All the kids from the whole neighborhood came, laughing and shouting in the schoolyard, sitting together in the schoolroom, going home together at the end of the day.

And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back.

A slight girl, looking younger than her seventeen years, was nervous yet excited as she felt the vibrations of the approaching train. It was her first day at the prestigious Royal Academy of Music in London and daunting enough for any teenager fresh from a Scottish farm. But this aspiring musician faced a bigger challenge than most: she was profoundly deaf. 2. Evelyn Glennie’s loss of hearing had been gradual. Her mother remembers noticing something was wrong when the eight-year-old Evelyn was waiting to play the piano. “They called her name and she didn’t move.

They were advised that she should be fitted with hearing aids and sent to a school for the deaf. “Everything suddenly looked black,” says Evelyn. 3. But Evelyn was not going to give up. She was determined to lead a normal life and pursue her interest in music. One day she noticed a girl playing a xylophone and decided that she wanted to play it too. Most of the teachers discouraged her but percussionist Ron Forbes spotted her potential. He began by tuning two large drums to different notes. “Don’t listen through your ears,” he would say, “try to sense it some other way.” Says Evelyn, “Suddenly I realised I could feel the higher drum from the waist up and the lower one from the waist down.” Forbes repeated the exercise, and soon Evelyn discovered that she could sense certain notes in different parts of her body. “I had learnt to open my mind and body to sounds and vibrations.” The rest was sheer determination and hard work. 4. She never looked back from that point onwards. She toured the United Kingdom with a youth orchestra and by the time she was sixteen, she had decided to make music her life. She auditioned for the Royal Academy of Music and scored one of the highest marks in the history of the academy. She gradually moved from orchestral work to solo performances. At the end of her three-year course, she had captured most of the top awards. 5. And for all this, Evelyn won’t accept any hint of heroic achievement. “If you work hard and know where you are going, you’ll get there.” And she got right to the top, the world’s most sought-after multi- percussionist with a mastery of some thousand instruments, and hectic international schedule. 6.

Few had thought that it would one day be revived. A barber of a family of professional musicians, who had access to the royal palace, decided to improve the tonal quality of the pungi.

The instrument so different from the pungi had to be given a new name. As the story goes, since it was first played in the Shah’s chambers and was played by a nai (barber), the instrument was named the ‘shehnai’. 2. The sound of the shehnai began to be considered auspicious. And for this reason it is still played in temples and is an indispensable component of any North Indian wedding. In the past, the shehnai was part of the naubat or traditional ensemble of nine instruments found at royal courts. Till recently it was used only in temples and weddings. The credit for bringing this instrument onto the classical stage goes to Ustad Bismillah Khan. 3. As a five-year old, Bismillah Khan played gilli-danda near a pond in the ancient estate of Dumraon in Bihar. He would regularly go to the nearby Bihariji temple to sing the Bhojpuri ‘Chaita’, at the end of which he would earn a big laddu weighing 1.25 kg, a prize given by the local Maharaja. This happened 80 years ago, and the little boy has travelled far to earn the highest civilian award in India — the Bharat Ratna. 4. Born on 21 March 1916, Bismillah belongs to a well-known family of musicians from Bihar. His grandfather, Rasool Bux Khan, was the shehnai- nawaz of the Bhojpur king’s court. His father, Paigambar Bux, and other paternal ancestors were also great shehnai players. paternal ancestors: ancestors of the father auspicious: promising to bring good fortune indispensable: without which a piece of work cannot be done ensembles (pronounced ‘onsomble’): things (here, instruments) considered as a group Pungi Shehnai Reprint 2025-26"}

At the age of three when his mother took him to his maternal uncle’s house in Benaras (now Varanasi), Bismillah was fascinated watching his uncles practise the shehnai. Soon Bismillah started accompanying his uncle, Ali Bux, to the Vishnu temple of Benaras where Bux was employed to play the shehnai. Ali Bux would play the shehnai and Bismillah would sit captivated for hours on end. Slowly, he started getting lessons in playing the instrument and would sit practising throughout the day. For years to come the temple of Balaji and Mangala Maiya and the banks of the Ganga became the young apprentice’s favourite haunts where he could practise in solitude. The flowing waters of the Ganga inspired him to improvise and invent raagas that were earlier considered to be beyond the range of the shehnai. 6. At the age of 14, Bismillah accompanied his uncle to the Allahabad Music Conference. At the end of his recital, Ustad Faiyaz Khan patted the young boy’s back and said, “Work hard and you shall make it.” With the opening of the All India Radio in Lucknow in 1938 came Bismillah’s big break. He soon became an often-heard shehnai player on radio. 7. When India gained independence on 15 August 1947, Bismillah Khan became the first Indian to greet the nation with his shehnai. He poured his heart out into Raag Kafi from the Red Fort to an audience which included Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, who later gave his famous ‘Tryst with Destiny’ speech. 8. Bismillah Khan has given many memorable performances both in India and abroad. His first trip abroad was to Afghanistan where King Zahir Shah was so taken in by the maestro that he gifted him priceless Persian carpets and other souvenirs. The King of Afghanistan was not the only one to be fascinated with Bismillah’s music.

Awards and recognition came thick and fast. Bismillah Khan became the first Indian to be invited to perform at the prestigious Lincoln Centre Hall in the United States of America. He also took part in the World Exposition in Montreal, in the Cannes Art Festival and in the Osaka Trade Fair.

And oh, there was a glad sense of relief when she heard the noise of the carriage growing fainter and fainter down the long road! In the evening when he came home she stood near the staircase and heard his loud voice in the hall. “Bring my tea into the drawing-room... Hasn’t the paper come yet? Mother, go and see if my paper’s out there — and bring me my slippers.” 2. “Kezia,” Mother would call to her, “if you’re a good girl you can come down and take off father’s boots.” Slowly the girl would slip down the stairs, more slowly still across the hall, and push open the drawing-room door. By that time he had his spectacles on and looked at her over them in a way that was terrifying to the little girl. “Well, Kezia, hurry up and pull off these boots and take them outside.

A TRULY BEAUTIFUL MIND The story of Einstein tries to show him as a human being, a fairly ordinary person who had his likes and dislikes, his streaks of rebellion, and his problems. The class can think about how a ‘great person’ was perceived before being recognised as ‘great’: it is not as though great people are born with a special sign that allows us to recognise them instantly! What qualities in a person, then, make them a genius or a great person? You can take the help of a science teacher to explain Einstein’s Theory of Relativity, to talk about Einstein, and build inter-subject cooperation. The exercise of matching headings to paragraphs in the lesson is useful for finding the topic sentence or to scan a paragraph for specific information. Students may be asked to provide a different heading if they feel some other point is equally important. Students should be guided to write a newspaper report. Note the points given below. Illustrate them by bringing examples from newspapers into the class, and ask students to bring their own examples. • A report should have: 1. A headline 2. Name of the reporter e.g. ‘By a Staff Reporter’, etc. 3. Place, date, source (the source may also be given at the end of the report). • The beginning is usually an expansion of the headline. The middle paragraph gives the details. It is followed by the conclusion or the summing up. • The report should be brief, but the headline and the style should be eye-catching. • Sometimes important points are given in a box in the centre of the report. • Regarding the language of the reports: 1. passives for past action (for example: It is found ..., ... has been unearthed.)

The narrator is a vain and foolish young man who in a moment of crisis realises that he is “poor, foolish and stupid”. The questions are designed to help the students notice the humour in the narration. This unit has a formal, expository passage for dictation. Students should be encouraged to learn the spellings of unfamiliar words beforehand. The dictation of such passages also encourages the development of grammar in the students’ minds, as they recall complex language. The Writing task is based on a sketch from a photograph that tells a story. Encourage the students to read the words given alongside the sketch. Let the students form pairs or groups to talk freely about the sketch before they start writing. A new kind of activity introduced in this lesson is to compare two translations of the beginning of a story.

In the summer of 1905, the 26-year-old published in quick succession four ground-breaking papers: about light, the motion of particles, the electrodynamics of moving bodies, and energy. His work took up only a few pages in scientific journals, but changed forever our understanding of space, time and the entire cosmos — and transformed the name ‘Einstein’ into a synonym for genius. • Fifty years after his death, Albert Einstein’s genius still reigns. 1. ALBERT Einstein was born on 14 March 1879 in the German city of Ulm, without any indication that he was destined for greatness. On the contrary, his mother thought Albert was a freak. To her, his head seemed much too large. 2. At the age of two-and-a-half, Einstein still wasn’t talking. When he finally did learn to speak, he uttered everything twice. Einstein did not know what to do with other children, and his playmates called him “Brother Boring.” So the youngster played by himself 4. A T 4. A T 4. A T 4. A T 4.

As he was a late talker, his parents were worried. At last, at the supper table one night, he broke his silence to say, “The soup is too hot.” Greatly relieved, his parents asked why he had never said a word before.

Looking at his newborn sister, Maja, he is said to have said: “Fine, but where are her wheels?” 3. A headmaster once told his father that what Einstein chose as a profession wouldn’t matter, because “he’ll never make a success at anything.” Einstein began learning to play the violin at the age of six, because his mother wanted him to; he later became a gifted amateur violinist, maintaining this skill throughout his life. 4. But Albert Einstein was not a bad pupil. He went to high school in Munich, where Einstein’s family had moved when he was 15 months old, and scored good marks in almost every subject. Einstein hated the school’s regimentation, and often clashed with his teachers. At the age of 15, Einstein felt so stifled there that he left the school for good. 5. The previous year, Albert’s parents had moved to Milan, and left their son with relatives. After prolonged discussion, Einstein got his wish to continue his education in German-speaking Switzerland, in a city which was more liberal than Munich. 6. Einstein was highly gifted in mathematics and interested in physics, and after finishing school, he decided to study at a university in Zurich.

He also felt a special interest in a fellow student, Mileva Maric, whom he found to be a “clever creature.” This young Serb had come to Switzerland because the University in Zurich was one of the few in Europe where women could get degrees. Einstein saw in her an ally against the “philistines”— those people in his family and at the university with whom he was constantly at odds. The couple fell in love. Letters survive in which they put their affection into words, mixing science with tenderness. Wrote Einstein: “How happy and proud I shall be when we both have brought our work on relativity to a victorious conclusion.” 8. In 1900, at the age of 21, Albert Einstein was a university graduate and unemployed. He worked as a teaching assistant, gave private lessons and finally secured a job in 1902 as a technical expert in the patent office in Bern. While he was supposed to be assessing other people’s inventions, Einstein was actually developing his own ideas in secret. He is said to have jokingly called his desk drawer at work the “bureau of theoretical physics.” 9. One of the famous papers of 1905 was Einstein’s Special Theory of Relativity, according to which time and distance are not absolute. Indeed, two perfectly accurate clocks will not continue to show the same time if they come together again after a journey if one of them has been moving very fast relative to the other.

She was also bothered by Mileva’s intelligence. “She is a book like you,” his mother said. Einstein put the wedding off. 11. The pair finally married in January 1903, and had two sons. But a few years later, the marriage faltered. Mileva, meanwhile, was losing her intellectual ambition and becoming an unhappy housewife. After years of constant fighting, the couple finally divorced in 1919. Einstein married his cousin Elsa the same year. * * * 12.Einstein’s new personal chapter coincided with his rise to world fame. In 1915, he had published his General Theory of Relativity, which provided a new interpretation of gravity. An eclipse of the sun in 1919 brought proof that it was accurate. Einstein had correctly calculated in advance the extent to which the light from fixed stars would be deflected through the sun’s gravitational field. The newspapers proclaimed his work as “a scientific revolution.” 13. Einstein received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921. He was showered with honours and invitations from all over the world, and lauded by the press. * * * 14. When the Nazis came to power in Germany in 1933, Einstein emigrated to the United States.

Roosevelt, on 2 August 1939, in which he warned: “A single bomb of this type . . . exploded in a port, might very well destroy the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory.” His words did not fail to have an effect. The Americans developed the atomic bomb in a secret project of their own, and dropped it on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. 16. Einstein was deeply shaken by the extent of the destruction. This time he wrote a public missive to the United Nations. In it he proposed the formation of a world government. Unlike the letter to Roosevelt, this one made no impact. But over the next decade, Einstein got ever more involved in politics — agitating for an end to the arms buildup and using his popularity to campaign for peace and democracy. 17.

This poem is a lyric. I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree, And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made: Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honeybee, And live alone in the bee-loud glade. And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings; There midnight’s all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow, And evenings full of the linnet’s wings. I will arise and go now, for always night and day I hear the lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore; While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey, I hear it in the deep heart’s core.

A full-blooded cobra?” All of us fell silent. The question came from the homeopath. The topic came up when we were discussing snakes. We listened attentively as the doctor continued with his tale. It was a hot summer night; about ten o’clock. I had my meal at the restaurant and returned to my room. I heard a noise from above as I opened the door. The sound was a familiar one. One could say that the rats and I shared the room. I took out my box of matches and lighted the kerosene lamp on the table. 2. The house was not electrified; it was a small rented room. I had just set up medical practice and my earnings were meagre. I had about sixty rupees in my suitcase. Along with some shirts and dhotis, I also possessed one solitary black coat which I was then wearing. 3. I took off my black coat, white shirt and not-so- white vest and hung them up. I opened the two windows in the room. It was an outer room with one wall facing the open yard. It had a tiled roof with long supporting gables that rested on the beam over the wall. There was no ceiling. There was a 5. The Snak 5. The Snak 5. The Snak 5. The Snak 5.

I opened the box beneath the table and took out a book, the Materia Medica. I opened it at the table on which stood the lamp and a large mirror; a small comb lay beside the mirror. One feels tempted to look into a mirror when it is near one. I took a look. In those days I was a great admirer of beauty and I believed in making myself look handsome. I was unmarried and I was a doctor. I felt I had to make my presence felt. I picked up the comb and ran it through my hair and adjusted the parting so that it looked straight and neat. Again I heard that sound from above. 5. I took a close look at my face in the mirror. I made an important decision — I would shave daily and grow a thin moustache to look more handsome. I was after all a bachelor, and a doctor! I looked into the mirror and smiled. It was an attractive smile. I made another earth-shaking decision. I would always keep that attractive smile on my face ... to look more handsome. I was after all a bachelor, and a doctor too on top of it! Again came that noise from above. 6. I got up, paced up and down the room. Then another lovely thought struck me. I would marry. I would get married to a woman doctor who had plenty of money and a good medical practice. She had to be fat; for a valid reason. If I made some silly mistake and needed to run away she should not be able to run after me and catch me!

I didn’t cry out. There was no time to do any such thing. The snake slithered along my shoulder and coiled around my left arm above the elbow. The hood was spread out and its head was hardly three or four inches from my face! It would not be correct to say merely that I sat there holding my breath. I was turned to stone. But my mind was very active. The door opened into darkness. The room was surrounded by darkness. In the light of the lamp I sat there like a stone image in the flesh. 8. I felt then the great presence of the creator of this world and this universe. God was there. Suppose I said something and he did not like it . . .

From there it crept onto the table and moved towards the mirror. Perhaps it wanted to enjoy its reflection at closer quarters. I was no mere image cut in granite. I was suddenly a man of flesh and blood. Still holding my breath I got up from the chair. I quietly went out through the door into the veranda.

Somebody asked, “Doctor, is your wife very fat?” 11. “No,” the doctor said. “God willed otherwise.

Read it twice and close your book. Your teacher will then dictate the paragraph to you. Write it down with appropriate punctuation marks. The Indian cobra is the common name for members of the family of venomous snakes, known for their intimidating looks and deadly bite. Cobras are recognised by the hoods that they flare when angry or disturbed; the hoods are created by the extension of the ribs behind the cobras’ heads. Obviously the best prevention is to avoid getting bitten. This is facilitated by the fact that humans are not the natural prey of any venomous snake. We are a bit large for them to swallow whole and they have no means of chopping us up into bite-size pieces. Nearly all snakebites in humans are the result of a snake defending itself when it feels threatened. In general snakes are shy and will simply leave if you give them a chance.

Abdul Kalam, whose projects in space, defence and nuclear technology guided India into the twenty-first century, became our eleventh President in 2002. • In his autobiography, Wings of Fire, he speaks of his childhood. 1. I WAS born into a middle-class Tamil family in the island town of Rameswaram in the erstwhile Madras State. My father, Jainulabdeen, had neither much formal education nor much wealth; despite these disadvantages, he possessed great innate wisdom and a true generosity of spirit. He had an ideal helpmate in my mother, Ashiamma. I do not recall the exact number of people she fed every day, but I am quite certain that far more outsiders ate with us than all the members of our own family put together. 2. I was one of many children — a short boy with rather undistinguished looks, born to tall and handsome parents. We lived in our ancestral house, which was built in the middle of the nineteenth century. It was a fairly large pucca house, made of limestone and brick, on the Mosque Street in Rameswaram. My austere father used to avoid all inessential comforts and luxuries. However, all necessities were provided for, in terms of food, medicine or clothes. In fact, I would say mine was a very secure childhood, both materially and emotionally. 6. My Childhood 6. My Childhood 6. My Childhood 6. My Childhood 6.

For reasons I have never been able to understand, a sudden demand for tamarind seeds erupted in the market. I used to collect the seeds and sell them to a provision shop on Mosque Street. A day’s collection would fetch me the princely sum of one anna. My brother-in-law Jallaluddin would tell me stories about the War which I would later attempt to trace in the headlines in Dinamani. Our area, being isolated, was completely unaffected by the War. But soon India was forced to join the Allied Forces and something like a state of emergency was declared. The first casualty came in the form of the suspension of the train halt at Rameswaram station. The newspapers now had to be bundled and thrown out from the moving train on the Rameswaram Road between Rameswaram and Dhanuskodi. That forced my cousin Samsuddin, who distributed newspapers in Rameswaram , to look for a helping hand to catch the bundles and, as if naturally, I filled the slot. Samsuddin helped me earn my first wages. Half a century later, I can still feel the surge of pride in earning my own money for the first time. 4. Every child is born, with some inherited characteristics, into a specific socio-economic and emotional environment, and trained in certain ways by figures of authority. I inherited honesty and self- discipline from my father; from my mother, I inherited faith in goodness and deep kindness and so did my three brothers and sister. I had three close friends in my childhood — Ramanadha Sastry, Aravindan and Sivaprakasan. All these boys were from orthodox Hindu Brahmin families. As children, none of us ever felt any difference amongst ourselves because of our religious differences and upbringing. In fact, Ramanadha Sastry was the son of Pakshi Lakshmana Sastry, the high priest of the Rameswaram temple.

There’s still a child in him though, and he’s still curious about learning new things. Life’s a mission for President Kalam. 2. Nonetheless, he remembers his first lesson in life and how it changed his destiny. “I was studying in Standard V, and must have been all of 10. My teacher, Sri Sivasubramania Iyer was telling us how birds fly. He drew a diagram of a bird on the blackboard, depicting the wings, tail and the body with the head and then explained how birds soar to the sky. At the end of the class, I said I didn’t understand. Then he asked the other students if they had understood, but nobody had understood how birds fly,” he recalls. 3. “That evening, the entire class was taken to Rameswarm shore,” the President continues. “My teacher showed us sea birds. We saw marvellous formations of them flying and how their wings flapped. Then my teacher asked us, ‘Where is the birds’ engine and how is it powered?’ I knew then that birds are powered by their own life and motivation. I understood all about birds’ dynamics. This was real teaching — a theoretical lesson coupled with a live practical example. Sri Siva Subramania Iyer was a great teacher.” That day, my future was decided. My destiny was changed. I knew my future had to be about flight and flight systems. Speaking Speaking Speaking Speaking Speaking Here is a topic for you to 1. think about; 2. give your opinion on.

An exercise of matching words and phrases to their meanings has been given as a pre-reading activity to facilitate students’ understanding and appreciation of this part of the text. In this unit students are asked to imagine that they have to give a speech. They may wish to read the texts of well-known speeches such as Nehru’s ‘Tryst with Destiny’. A speech is a formal use of spoken language. It must be prepared meticulously. The language is formal but should be made powerful by the use of balance (“Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.” — Kennedy), imagery (“The light has gone out of our lives” — Nehru) and other such rhetorical devices. It can be enriched by the use of examples and anecdotes. The Writing task of composing an article for a school magazine can be prepared for by looking at other examples of such articles in newspapers. This task makes a beginning in helping students to write for the print media. Encourage them to work within a given word limit (such as 500 words, or 1000 words), and to use everyday, contemporary language. Help students to write a description of Santosh Yadav’s character by drawing their attention to her background, likes and dislikes, her humanity and her contribution to society. 8.

The map reading activity and the activity on locating the possible routes (by road, rail or air) from Kathmandu to different places in India are designed to link the lesson to the outside world. Students may wish to consult brochures or travel guides, visit a travel agency or call them on the telephone, speak to people who have been to Nepal, and so on.

Where other girls wore traditional Indian dresses, Santosh preferred shorts. Looking back, she says now, “From the very beginning I was quite determined that if I chose a correct and a rational path, the others around me had to change, not me.” 3. Santosh’s parents were affluent landowners who could afford to send their children to the best schools, even to the country’s capital, New Delhi, which was quite close by. But, in line with the prevailing custom in the family, Santosh had to make do with the local village school. So, she decided to fight the system in her own quiet way when the right moment arrived. And the right moment came when she turned sixteen. At sixteen, most of the girls in her village used to get married. Santosh was also under pressure from her parents to do the same. 4. A marriage as early as that was the last thing on her mind. She threatened her parents that she would never marry if she did not get a proper education. She left home and got herself enrolled in a school in Delhi. When her parents refused to pay for her education, she politely informed them of her plans to earn money by working part time to pay her school fees. Her parents then agreed to pay for her education. 5. Wishing always to study “a bit more” and with her father slowly getting used to her urge for more education, Santosh passed the high school examinations and went to Jaipur.

One day I decided to check it out myself. I found nobody except a few mountaineers. I asked if I could join them. To my pleasant surprise, they answered in the affirmative and motivated me to take to climbing.” 6. Then there was no looking back for this determined young girl. She saved money and enrolled in a course at Uttarkashi’s Nehru Institute of Mountaineering. “My college semester in Jaipur was to end in April but it ended on the nineteenth of May. And I was supposed to be in Uttarkashi on the twenty-first. So, I did not go back home; instead, I headed straight for the training. I had to write a letter of apology to my father without whose permission I had got myself enrolled at Uttarkashi.” 7. Thereafter, Santosh went on an expedition every year. Her climbing skills matured rapidly. Also, she developed a remarkable resistance to cold and the altitude. Equipped with an iron will, physical endurance and an amazing mental toughness, she proved herself repeatedly. The culmination of her hard work and sincerity came in 1992, just four years after she had shyly asked the Aravalli mountaineers if she could join them. At barely twenty years of age, Santosh Yadav scaled Mt Everest, becoming the youngest woman in the world to achieve the feat.

Within twelve months, Santosh found herself a member of an Indo-Nepalese Women’s Expedition that invited her to join them. She then scaled the Everest a second time, thus setting a record as the only woman to have scaled the Everest twice, and securing for herself and India a unique place in the annals of mountaineering. In recognition of her achievements, the Indian government bestowed upon her one of the nation’s top honours, the Padmashri. 10. Describing her feelings when she was literally ‘on top of the world’, Santosh has said, “It took some time for the enormity of the moment to sink in ...

However, the rapid ascent in a fiercely competitive world began nine years before with a level of sacrifice few children would be prepared to endure. Little Maria had not yet celebrated her tenth birthday when she was packed off to train in the United States. That trip to Florida with her father Yuri launched her on the path to success and stardom. But it also required a heart-wrenching two-year separation from her mother Yelena. The latter was compelled to stay back in Siberia because of visa restrictions. The nine-year-old girl had already learnt an important lesson in life — that tennis excellence would only come at a price. 3. “I used to be so lonely,” Maria Sharapova recalls. “I missed my mother terribly. My father was working as much as he could to keep my tennis-training going.

While her journey from the frozen plains of Siberia to the summit of women’s tennis has touched the hearts of tennis fans, for the youngster herself there appears to be no room for sentiment. The straight looks and the answers she gives when asked about her ambition make it amply clear that she considers the sacrifices were worth it. “I am very, very competitive. I work hard at what I do. It’s my job.” This is her mantra for success. 8. Though Maria Sharapova speaks with a pronounced American accent, she proudly parades her Russian nationality. Clearing all doubts, she says, “I’m Russian. It’s true that the U.S. is a big part of my life. But I have Russian citizenship. My blood is totally Russian. I will play the Olympics for Russia if they want me.” 9. Like any number of teenaged sensations, Maria Sharapova lists fashion, singing and dancing as her hobbies.

The Raincoat After four years of drought in a small town in the Northeast, the Vicar gathered everyone together for a pilgrimage to the mountain, where they would pray together and ask for the rain to return. The priest noticed a boy in the group wearing a raincoat. “Have you gone mad?” he asked. “It hasn’t rained in this region for five years, the heat will kill you climbing the mountain.” “I have a cold, father. If we are going to ask God for rain, can you imagine the way back from the mountain? It’s going to be such a downpour that I need to be prepared.” At that moment a great crash was heard in the sky and the first drops began to fall.

Yes, I expect I’ll still be here, but you mustn’t count on that ... In about ten minutes’ time. Right-ho. Goodbye. (He puts down the phone and goes to the divan on the left, where there is a travelling bag, and starts packing. Whilst he is thus engaged, another man, similar in build to Gerrard enters from the right silently — revolver in hand. He is flashily dressed in an overcoat and a soft hat. He bumps accidentally against the table, and at the sound Gerrard turns quickly.) GERRARD : (pleasantly) Why, this is a surprise, Mr— er — INTRUDER : I’m glad you’re pleased to see me. I don’t think you’ll be pleased for long. Put those paws up! GERRARD : This is all very melodramatic, not very original, perhaps, but… INTRUDER : Trying to be calm and — er— GERRARD : ‘Nonchalant’ is your word, I think. INTRUDER : Thanks a lot.

How as a child I was stolen by the gypsies, and why at the age of thirty-two, I find myself in my lonely Essex cottage, how ... INTRUDER : Keep it to yourself, and just answer my questions. You live here alone? Well, do you? GERRARD : I’m sorry. I thought you were telling me, not asking me. A question of inflection; your voice is unfamiliar. INTRUDER : (with emphasis) Do you live here alone? GERRARD : And if I don’t answer? INTRUDER : You’ve got enough sense not to want to get hurt.

I’m as smart as you and smarter, and I know you run a car. Better be careful, wise guy! GERRARD : Are you American, or is that merely a clever imitation? INTRUDER : Listen, this gun’s no toy. I can hurt you without killing you, and still get my answers. GERRARD : Of course, if you put it like that, I’ll be glad to assist you. I do possess a car, and it’s in the garage round the corner. INTRUDER : That’s better. Do people often come out here? GERRARD : Very rarely. Surprisingly few people take the trouble to visit me. There’s the baker and the greengrocer, of course; and then there’s the milkman — quite charming, but no one so interesting as yourself. INTRUDER : I happen to know that you never see tradespeople.

GERRARD : And where precisely have you got? It didn’t require a great brain to break into my little cottage. INTRUDER : When you know why I’ve broken into your little cottage, you’ll be surprised, and it won’t be a pleasant surprise. GERRARD : With you figuring so largely in it, that is understandable. By the way, what particular line of crime do you embrace, or aren’t you a specialist? INTRUDER : My speciality’s jewel robbery. Your car will do me a treat. It’s certainly a dandy bus. GERRARD : I’m afraid jewels are few and far between in the wilds of Essex. INTRUDER : So are the cops. I can retire here nicely for a little while. GERRARD : You mean to live with me?

GERRARD : Why add murder to your other crimes? It’s a grave step you’re taking. INTRUDER : I’m not taking it for fun. I’ve been hunted long enough. I’m wanted for murder already, and they can’t hang me twice. GERRARD : You’re planning a gratuitous double, so to speak. Admitted you’ve nothing to lose, but what have you to gain? INTRUDER : I’ve got freedom to gain. As for myself, I’m a poor hunted rat. As Vincent Charles Gerrard I’m free to go places and do nothing. I can eat well and sleep and without having to be ready to beat it at the sight of a cop. GERRARD : In most melodramas the villain is foolish enough to delay his killing long enough to be frustrated.

{"id": "class 9__maths__p3__c1", "text": "FOREWORD The National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2005, recommends that children’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the national Policy on Education (1986). The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognize that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge. This aims imply considerable change is school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather then a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience. The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in science and mathematics, Professor J.V. Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor P. Sinclair of IGNOU, New Delhi for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed Reprint 2025-26"}

The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the content load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative mindset. In this background, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise. Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following: • Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the same class • Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject • Difficulty level • Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions from teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-learning • Content, which is irrelevant in the present context This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes given above.

Now turn and walk all the way back, pick up zero and put it into the bag. You now have the collection of whole numbers which is denoted by the symbol W. Now, stretching in front of you are many, many negative integers. Put all the negative integers into your bag. What is your new collection? Recall that it is the collection of all integers, and it is denoted by the symbol Z. Are there some numbers still left on the line? Of course! There are numbers like 1 3 , 2 4 , or even 2005 2006 − .

{"id": "class 9__maths__p15__c1", "text": "NUMBER SYSTEMS 3 collection of rational numbers. The collection of rational numbers is denoted by Q. ‘Rational’ comes from the word ‘ratio’, and Q comes from the word ‘quotient’. You may recall the definition of rational numbers: A number ‘r’ is called a rational number, if it can be written in the form p q , where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0. (Why do we insist that q ≠ 0?) Notice that all the numbers now in the bag can be written in the form p q , where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0. For example, –25 can be written as 25; 1 − here p = –25 and q = 1. Therefore, the rational numbers also include the natural numbers, whole numbers and integers. You also know that the rational numbers do not have a unique representation in the form p q , where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0. For example, 1 2 = 2 4 = 10 20 = 25 50 = 47 94 , and so on. These are equivalent rational numbers (or fractions). However, when we say that p q is a rational number, or when we represent p q on the number line, we assume that q ≠ 0 and that p and q have no common factors other than 1 (that is, p and q are co-prime). So, on the number line, among the infinitely many fractions equivalent to 1 2 , we will choose 1 2 to represent all of them. Now, let us solve some examples about the different types of numbers, which you have studied in earlier classes. Example 1 : Are the following statements true or false? Give reasons for your answers. (i) Every whole number is a natural number. (ii) Every integer is a rational number. (iii) Every rational number is an integer. Solution : (i) False, because zero is a whole number but not a natural number. (ii) True, because every integer m can be expressed in the form 1 m , and so it is a rational number. Reprint 2025-26"}

We can approach this problem in at least two ways. Solution 1 : Recall that to find a rational number between r and s, you can add r and s and divide the sum by 2, that is 2 r s + lies between r and s. So, 3 2 is a number between 1 and 2. You can proceed in this manner to find four more rational numbers between 1 and 2. These four numbers are 5 11 13 7. , , and 4 8 8 4 Solution 2 : The other option is to find all the five rational numbers in one step. Since we want five numbers, we write 1 and 2 as rational numbers with denominator 5 + 1, i.e., 1 = 6 6 and 2 = 12 6 . Then you can check that 7 6 , 8 6 , 9 6 , 10 6 and 11 6 are all rational numbers between 1 and 2. So, the five numbers are 7 4 3 5 11 , , , and 6 3 2 3 6 . Remark : Notice that in Example 2, you were asked to find five rational numbers between 1 and 2. But, you must have realised that in fact there are infinitely many rational numbers between 1 and 2. In general, there are infinitely many rational numbers between any two given rational numbers. Let us take a look at the number line again. Have you picked up all the numbers? Not, yet. The fact is that there are infinitely many more numbers left on the number line! There are gaps in between the places of the numbers you picked up, and not just one or two but infinitely many. The amazing thing is that there are infinitely many numbers lying between any two of these gaps too! So we are left with the following questions: 1. What are the numbers, that are left on the number line, called? 2. How do we recognise them? That is, how do we distinguish them from the rationals (rational numbers)? These questions will be answered in the next section. Reprint 2025-26"}

In this section, we are going to investigate these numbers. So far, all the numbers you have come across, are of the form p q , where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0. So, you may ask: are there numbers which are not of this form? There are indeed such numbers. The Pythagoreans in Greece, followers of the famous mathematician and philosopher Pythagoras, were the first to discover the numbers which were not rationals, around 400 BC. These numbers are called irrational numbers (irrationals), because they cannot be written in the form of a ratio of integers. There are many myths surrounding the discovery of irrational numbers by the Pythagorean, Hippacus of Croton. In all the myths, Hippacus has an unfortunate end, either for discovering that 2 is irrational or for disclosing the secret about 2 to people outside the secret Pythagorean sect! Let us formally define these numbers. A number ‘s’ is called irrational, if it cannot be written in the form p q , where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0.

It turns out that there are infinitely many irrational numbers too. Some examples are: 2, 3, 15, π, 0.10110111011110... Remark : Recall that when we use the symbol , we assume that it is the positive square root of the number. So 4 = 2, though both 2 and –2 are square roots of 4. Some of the irrational numbers listed above are familiar to you. For example, you have already come across many of the square roots listed above and the number π. The Pythagoreans proved that 2 is irrational. Later in approximately 425 BC, Theodorus of Cyrene showed that 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 17 are also irrationals. Proofs of irrationality of 2 , 3 , 5 , etc., shall be discussed in Class X. As to π, it was known to various cultures for thousands of years, it was proved to be irrational by Lambert and Legendre only in the late 1700s. In the next section, we will discuss why 0.10110111011110... and π are irrational. Let us return to the questions raised at the end of the previous section. Remember the bag of rational numbers. If we now put all irrational numbers into the bag, will there be any number left on the number line? The answer is no! It turns out that the collection of all rational numbers and irrational numbers together make up what we call the collection of real numbers, which is denoted by R. Therefore, a real number is either rational or irrational. So, we can say that every real number is represented by a unique point on the number line. Also, every point on the number line represents a unique real number. This is why we call the number line, the real number line. In the 1870s two German mathematicians, Cantor and Dedekind, showed that : Corresponding to every real number, there is a point on the real number line, and corresponding to every point on the number line, there exists a unique real number.

We will look at the decimal expansions of real numbers and see if we can use the expansions to distinguish between rationals and irrationals. We will also explain how to visualise the representation of real numbers on the number line using their decimal expansions. Since rationals are more familiar to us, let us start with them.

You should have noticed at least three things: (i) The remainders either become 0 after a certain stage, or start repeating themselves. (ii) The number of entries in the repeating string of remainders is less than the divisor (in 10 3 one number repeats itself and the divisor is 3, in 1 7 there are six entries 326451 in the repeating string of remainders and 7 is the divisor). (iii) If the remainders repeat, then we get a repeating block of digits in the quotient (for 10 3 , 3 repeats in the quotient and for 1 7 , we get the repeating block 142857 in the quotient).

{"id": "class 9__maths__p22__c1", "text": "10 MATHEMATICS Although we have noticed this pattern using only the examples above, it is true for all rationals of the form p q (q ≠ 0). On division of p by q, two main things happen – either the remainder becomes zero or never becomes zero and we get a repeating string of remainders. Let us look at each case separately. Case (i) : The remainder becomes zero In the example of 7 8 , we found that the remainder becomes zero after some steps and the decimal expansion of 7 8 = 0.875. Other examples are 1 2 = 0.5, 639 250 = 2.556. In all these cases, the decimal expansion terminates or ends after a finite number of steps. We call the decimal expansion of such numbers terminating. Case (ii) : The remainder never becomes zero In the examples of 10 3 and 1 7 , we notice that the remainders repeat after a certain stage forcing the decimal expansion to go on for ever. In other words, we have a repeating block of digits in the quotient. We say that this expansion is non-terminating recurring. For example, 10 3 = 3.3333... and 1 7 = 0.142857142857142857... The usual way of showing that 3 repeats in the quotient of 10 3 is to write it as 3.3. Similarly, since the block of digits 142857 repeats in the quotient of 1 7 , we write 1 7 as 0.142857 , where the bar above the digits indicates the block of digits that repeats. Also 3.57272... can be written as 3.572 . So, all these examples give us non-terminating recurring (repeating) decimal expansions. Thus, we see that the decimal expansion of rational numbers have only two choices: either they are terminating or non-terminating recurring. Now suppose, on the other hand, on your walk on the number line, you come across a number like 3.142678 whose decimal expansion is terminating or a number like 1.272727... that is, 1.27 , whose decimal expansion is non-terminating recurring, can you conclude that it is a rational number?

Solution : We have 3.142678 = 3142678 1000000 , and hence is a rational number. Now, let us consider the case when the decimal expansion is non-terminating recurring. Example 7 : Show that 0.3333... = 03. can be expressed in the form p q , where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0. Solution : Since we do not know what 03. is , let us call it ‘x’ and so x = 0.3333...

So, every number with a non-terminating recurring decimal expansion can be expressed in the form p q (q ≠ 0), where p and q are integers. Let us summarise our results in the following form : The decimal expansion of a rational number is either terminating or non- terminating recurring. Moreover, a number whose decimal expansion is terminating or non-terminating recurring is rational. So, now we know what the decimal expansion of a rational number can be. What about the decimal expansion of irrational numbers? Because of the property above, we can conclude that their decimal expansions are non-terminating non-recurring. So, the property for irrational numbers, similar to the property stated above for rational numbers, is The decimal expansion of an irrational number is non-terminating non-recurring.

(Note that, we often take 22 7 as an approximate value for π, but π ≠ 22 7 .) Over the years, mathematicians have developed various techniques to produce more and more digits in the decimal expansions of irrational numbers. For example, you might have learnt to find digits in the decimal expansion of 2 by the division method. Interestingly, in the Sulbasutras (rules of chord), a mathematical treatise of the Vedic period (800 BC - 500 BC), you find an approximation of 2 as follows: 2 = 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4142156 3 4 3 34 4 3 .     + + × − × × =         Notice that it is the same as the one given above for the first five decimal places. The history of the hunt for digits in the decimal expansion of π is very interesting. The Greek genius Archimedes was the first to compute digits in the decimal expansion of π. He showed 3.140845 < π < 3.142857. Aryabhatta (476 – 550 C.E.), the great Indian mathematician and astronomer, found the value of π correct to four decimal places (3.1416). Using high speed computers and advanced algorithms, π has been computed to over 1.24 trillion decimal places! Now, let us see how to obtain irrational numbers.

Moreover, if we add, subtract, multiply or divide (except by zero) two rational numbers, we still get a rational number (that is, rational numbers are ‘closed’ with respect to addition, subtraction, multiplication and division). It turns out that irrational numbers also satisfy the commutative, associative and distributive laws for addition and multiplication. However, the sum, difference, quotients and products of irrational numbers are not always irrational. For example, ( ) ( ) 6 6 + − ,( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 2 2 3 3 , − ⋅ and 17 17 are rationals. Let us look at what happens when we add and multiply a rational number with an irrational number. For example, 3 is irrational. What about 2 3 + and 2 3 ? Since 3 has a non-terminating non-recurring decimal expansion, the same is true for 2 3 + and 2 3 . Therefore, both 2 3 + and 2 3 are also irrational numbers. Example 11 : Check whether 7 5 , 7 2 21 2 5 , , + π − are irrational numbers or not. Solution : 5 = 2.236... , 2 = 1.4142..., π = 3.1415...

(iii) If we add, subtract, multiply or divide two irrationals, the result may be rational or irrational. We now turn our attention to the operation of taking square roots of real numbers. Recall that, if a is a natural number, then a b = means b2 = a and b > 0. The same definition can be extended for positive real numbers. Let a > 0 be a real number. Then a = b means b2 = a and b > 0.

Then, as we have done for the case x = 3.5, we find BD = x (see Fig. 1.12). We can prove this result using the Pythagoras Theorem. Notice that, in Fig. 1.12, ∆ OBD is a right-angled triangle.

We end this section by considering the following problem. Look at 1 2 ⋅ Can you tell where it shows up on the number line? You know that it is irrational. May be it is easier to handle if the denominator is a rational number. Let us see, if we can ‘rationalise’ the denominator, that is, to make the denominator into a rational number. To do so, we need the identities involving square roots. Let us see how. Example 16 : Rationalise the denominator of 1 2 ⋅ Solution : We want to write 1 2 as an equivalent expression in which the denominator is a rational number. We know that 2 . 2 is rational. We also know that multiplying 1 2 by 2 2 will give us an equivalent expression, since 2 2 = 1. So, we put these two facts together to get 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 = × = ⋅ In this form, it is easy to locate 1 2 on the number line. It is half way between 0 and 2 . Reprint 2025-26"}

You also have studied how to factorise some algebraic expressions. You may recall the algebraic identities : (x + y)2 = x2 + 2xy + y2 (x – y)2 = x2 – 2xy + y2 and x2 – y2 = (x + y) (x – y) and their use in factorisation. In this chapter, we shall start our study with a particular type of algebraic expression, called polynomial, and the terminology related to it. We shall also study the Remainder Theorem and Factor Theorem and their use in the factorisation of polynomials. In addition to the above, we shall study some more algebraic identities and their use in factorisation and in evaluating some given expressions. 2.2 Polynomials in One Variable Let us begin by recalling that a variable is denoted by a symbol that can take any real value. We use the letters x, y, z, etc. to denote variables. Notice that 2x, 3x, – x, – 1 2 x are algebraic expressions. All these expressions are of the form (a constant) × x. Now suppose we want to write an expression which is (a constant) × (a variable) and we do not know what the constant is. In such cases, we write the constant as a, b, c, etc. So the expression will be ax, say. However, there is a difference between a letter denoting a constant and a letter denoting a variable. The values of the constants remain the same throughout a particular situation, that is, the values of the constants do not change in a given problem, but the value of a variable can keep changing.

{"id": "class 9__maths__p38__c1", "text": "26 MATHEMATICS Now, consider a square of side 3 units (see Fig. 2.1). What is its perimeter? You know that the perimeter of a square is the sum of the lengths of its four sides. Here, each side is 3 units. So, its perimeter is 4 × 3, i.e., 12 units. What will be the perimeter if each side of the square is 10 units? The perimeter is 4 × 10, i.e., 40 units. In case the length of each side is x units (see Fig. 2.2), the perimeter is given by 4x units. So, as the length of the side varies, the perimeter varies. Can you find the area of the square PQRS? It is x × x = x2 square units. x2 is an algebraic expression. You are also familiar with other algebraic expressions like 2x, x2 + 2x, x3 – x2 + 4x + 7. Note that, all the algebraic expressions we have considered so far have only whole numbers as the exponents of the variable. Expressions of this form are called polynomials in one variable. In the examples above, the variable is x. For instance, x3 – x2 + 4x + 7 is a polynomial in x. Similarly, 3y2 + 5y is a polynomial in the variable y and t2 + 4 is a polynomial in the variable t. In the polynomial x2 + 2x, the expressions x2 and 2x are called the terms of the polynomial. Similarly, the polynomial 3y2 + 5y + 7 has three terms, namely, 3y2, 5y and 7. Can you write the terms of the polynomial –x3 + 4x2 + 7x – 2 ? This polynomial has 4 terms, namely, –x3, 4x2, 7x and –2. Each term of a polynomial has a coefficient. So, in –x3 + 4x2 + 7x – 2, the coefficient of x3 is –1, the coefficient of x2 is 4, the coefficient of x is 7 and –2 is the coefficient of x0 (Remember, x0 = 1). Do you know the coefficient of x in x2 – x + 7? It is –1. 2 is also a polynomial. In fact, 2, –5, 7, etc. are examples of constant polynomials. The constant polynomial 0 is called the zero polynomial. This plays a very important role in the collection of all polynomials, as you will see in the higher classes. Now, consider algebraic expressions such as x + 2 3 1 , 3 and . + + x y y x Do you know that you can write x + 1 x = x + x–1? Here, the exponent of the second term, i.e., x–1 is –1, which is not a whole number. So, this algebraic expression is not a polynomial. Again, 3 x + can be written as 1 2 3 x + . Here the exponent of x is 1 2 , which is not a whole number. So, is 3 x + a polynomial? No, it is not. What about 3 y + y2? It is also not a polynomial (Why?).

{"id": "class 9__maths__p39__c1", "text": "POLYNOMIALS 27 If the variable in a polynomial is x, we may denote the polynomial by p(x), or q(x), or r(x), etc. So, for example, we may write : p(x) = 2x2 + 5x – 3 q(x) = x3 –1 r(y) = y3 + y + 1 s(u) = 2 – u – u2 + 6u5 A polynomial can have any (finite) number of terms. For instance, x150 + x149 + ... + x2 + x + 1 is a polynomial with 151 terms. Consider the polynomials 2x, 2, 5x3, –5x2, y and u4. Do you see that each of these polynomials has only one term? Polynomials having only one term are called monomials (‘mono’ means ‘one’). Now observe each of the following polynomials: p(x) = x + 1, q(x) = x2 – x, r(y) = y9 + 1, t(u) = u15 – u2 How many terms are there in each of these? Each of these polynomials has only two terms. Polynomials having only two terms are called binomials (‘bi’ means ‘two’). Similarly, polynomials having only three terms are called trinomials (‘tri’ means ‘three’). Some examples of trinomials are p(x) = x + x2 + π, q(x) = 2 + x – x2, r(u) = u + u2 – 2, t(y) = y4 + y + 5. Now, look at the polynomial p(x) = 3x7 – 4x6 + x + 9. What is the term with the highest power of x ? It is 3x7. The exponent of x in this term is 7. Similarly, in the polynomial q(y) = 5y6 – 4y2 – 6, the term with the highest power of y is 5y6 and the exponent of y in this term is 6. We call the highest power of the variable in a polynomial as the degree of the polynomial. So, the degree of the polynomial 3x7 – 4x6 + x + 9 is 7 and the degree of the polynomial 5y6 – 4y2 – 6 is 6. The degree of a non-zero constant polynomial is zero. Example 1 : Find the degree of each of the polynomials given below: (i) x5 – x4 + 3 (ii) 2 – y2 – y3 + 2y8 (iii) 2 Solution : (i) The highest power of the variable is 5. So, the degree of the polynomial is 5. (ii) The highest power of the variable is 8. So, the degree of the polynomial is 8. (iii) The only term here is 2 which can be written as 2x0. So the exponent of x is 0. Therefore, the degree of the polynomial is 0. Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 9__maths__p40__c1", "text": "28 MATHEMATICS Now observe the polynomials p(x) = 4x + 5, q(y) = 2y, r(t) = t + 2 and s(u) = 3 – u. Do you see anything common among all of them? The degree of each of these polynomials is one. A polynomial of degree one is called a linear polynomial. Some more linear polynomials in one variable are 2x – 1, 2 y + 1, 2 – u. Now, try and find a linear polynomial in x with 3 terms? You would not be able to find it because a linear polynomial in x can have at most two terms. So, any linear polynomial in x will be of the form ax + b, where a and b are constants and a ≠ 0 (why?). Similarly, ay + b is a linear polynomial in y. Now consider the polynomials : 2x2 + 5, 5x2 + 3x + π, x2 and x2 + 2 5 x Do you agree that they are all of degree two? A polynomial of degree two is called a quadratic polynomial. Some examples of a quadratic polynomial are 5 – y2, 4y + 5y2 and 6 – y – y2. Can you write a quadratic polynomial in one variable with four different terms? You will find that a quadratic polynomial in one variable will have at most 3 terms. If you list a few more quadratic polynomials, you will find that any quadratic polynomial in x is of the form ax2 + bx + c, where a ≠ 0 and a, b, c are constants. Similarly, quadratic polynomial in y will be of the form ay2 + by + c, provided a ≠ 0 and a, b, c are constants. We call a polynomial of degree three a cubic polynomial. Some examples of a cubic polynomial in x are 4x3, 2x3 + 1, 5x3 + x2, 6x3 – x, 6 – x3, 2x3 + 4x2 + 6x + 7. How many terms do you think a cubic polynomial in one variable can have? It can have at most 4 terms. These may be written in the form ax3 + bx2 + cx + d, where a ≠ 0 and a, b, c and d are constants. Now, that you have seen what a polynomial of degree 1, degree 2, or degree 3 looks like, can you write down a polynomial in one variable of degree n for any natural number n? A polynomial in one variable x of degree n is an expression of the form anxn + an–1xn–1 + . . . + a1x + a0 where a0, a1, a2, . . ., an are constants and an ≠ 0. In particular, if a0 = a1 = a2 = a3 = . . . = an = 0 (all the constants are zero), we get the zero polynomial, which is denoted by 0. What is the degree of the zero polynomial? The degree of the zero polynomial is not defined. So far we have dealt with polynomials in one variable only. We can also have polynomials in more than one variable. For example, x2 + y2 + xyz (where variables are x, y and z) is a polynomial in three variables. Similarly p2 + q10 + r (where the variables are p, q and r), u3 + v2 (where the variables are u and v) are polynomials in three and two variables, respectively. You will be studying such polynomials in detail later. Reprint 2025-26"}

What is p(1)? Note that : p(1) = 1 – 1 = 0. As p(1) = 0, we say that 1 is a zero of the polynomial p(x). Similarly, you can check that 2 is a zero of q(x), where q(x) = x – 2. In general, we say that a zero of a polynomial p(x) is a number c such that p(c) = 0. You must have observed that the zero of the polynomial x – 1 is obtained by equating it to 0, i.e., x – 1 = 0, which gives x = 1. We say p(x) = 0 is a polynomial equation and 1 is the root of the polynomial equation p(x) = 0. So we say 1 is the zero of the polynomial x – 1, or a root of the polynomial equation x – 1 = 0. Now, consider the constant polynomial 5. Can you tell what its zero is? It has no zero because replacing x by any number in 5x0 still gives us 5. In fact, a non-zero constant polynomial has no zero. What about the zeroes of the zero polynomial? By convention, every real number is a zero of the zero polynomial. Example 3 : Check whether –2 and 2 are zeroes of the polynomial x + 2. Solution : Let p(x) = x + 2. Then p(2) = 2 + 2 = 4, p(–2) = –2 + 2 = 0 Therefore, –2 is a zero of the polynomial x + 2, but 2 is not. Example 4 : Find a zero of the polynomial p(x) = 2x + 1.

Now, if p(x) = ax + b, a ≠ 0, is a linear polynomial, how can we find a zero of p(x)? Example 4 may have given you some idea. Finding a zero of the polynomial p(x), amounts to solving the polynomial equation p(x) = 0. Now, p(x) = 0 means ax + b = 0, a ≠ 0 So, ax = –b i.e., x = – b a . So, x = b a − is the only zero of p(x), i.e., a linear polynomial has one and only one zero. Now we can say that 1 is the zero of x – 1, and –2 is the zero of x + 2.

It tells us that since the remainder, 1 2 q  −     = 0, (2t + 1) is a factor of q(t), i.e., q(t) = (2t + 1) g(t) for some polynomial g(t). This is a particular case of the following theorem. Factor Theorem : If p(x) is a polynomial of degree n > 1 and a is any real number, then (i) x – a is a factor of p(x), if p(a) = 0, and (ii) p(a) = 0, if x – a is a factor of p(x). Proof: By the Remainder Theorem, p(x)=(x – a) q(x) + p(a). (i) If p(a) = 0, then p(x) = (x – a) q(x), which shows that x – a is a factor of p(x). (ii) Since x – a is a factor of p(x), p(x) = (x – a) g(x) for same polynomial g(x). In this case, p(a) = (a – a) g(a) = 0. Example 6 : Examine whether x + 2 is a factor of x3 + 3x2 + 5x + 6 and of 2x + 4. Solution : The zero of x + 2 is –2. Let p(x) = x3 + 3x2 + 5x + 6 and s(x) = 2x + 4 Then, p(–2) = (–2)3 + 3(–2)2 + 5(–2) + 6 = –8 + 12 – 10 + 6 = 0 Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 9__maths__p45__c1", "text": "POLYNOMIALS 33 So, by the Factor Theorem, x + 2 is a factor of x3 + 3x2 + 5x + 6. Again, s(–2) = 2(–2) + 4 = 0 So, x + 2 is a factor of 2x + 4. In fact, you can check this without applying the Factor Theorem, since 2x + 4 = 2(x + 2). Example 7 : Find the value of k, if x – 1 is a factor of 4x3 + 3x2 – 4x + k. Solution : As x – 1 is a factor of p(x) = 4x3 + 3x2 – 4x + k, p(1) = 0 Now, p(1) = 4(1)3 + 3(1)2 – 4(1) + k So, 4 + 3 – 4 + k = 0 i.e., k = –3 We will now use the Factor Theorem to factorise some polynomials of degree 2 and 3. You are already familiar with the factorisation of a quadratic polynomial like x2 + lx + m. You had factorised it by splitting the middle term lx as ax + bx so that ab = m. Then x2 + lx + m = (x + a) (x + b). We shall now try to factorise quadratic polynomials of the type ax2 + bx + c, where a ≠ 0 and a, b, c are constants. Factorisation of the polynomial ax2 + bx + c by splitting the middle term is as follows: Let its factors be (px + q) and (rx + s). Then ax2 + bx + c = (px + q) (rx + s) = pr x2 + (ps + qr) x + qs Comparing the coefficients of x2, we get a = pr. Similarly, comparing the coefficients of x, we get b = ps + qr. And, on comparing the constant terms, we get c = qs. This shows us that b is the sum of two numbers ps and qr, whose product is (ps)(qr) = (pr)(qs) = ac. Therefore, to factorise ax2 + bx + c, we have to write b as the sum of two numbers whose product is ac. This will be clear from Example 13. Example 8 : Factorise 6x2 + 17x + 5 by splitting the middle term, and by using the Factor Theorem. Solution 1 : (By splitting method) : If we can find two numbers p and q such that p + q = 17 and pq = 6 × 5 = 30, then we can get the factors. So, let us look for the pairs of factors of 30. Some are 1 and 30, 2 and 15, 3 and 10, 5 and 6. Of these pairs, 2 and 15 will give us p + q = 17. 2 3x x = 3x = first term of quotient Reprint 2025-26"}

If a and b are the zeroes of p(x), then 6x2 + 17x + 5 = 6(x – a) (x – b). So, ab = 5. 6 Let us look at some possibilities for a and b. They could be 1 1 5 5 , , , , 1 2 3 3 2 ± ± ± ± ± .

However, let us consider another example. Example 9 : Factorise y2 – 5y + 6 by using the Factor Theorem. Solution : Let p(y) = y2 – 5y + 6. Now, if p(y) = (y – a) (y – b), you know that the constant term will be ab. So, ab = 6. So, to look for the factors of p(y), we look at the factors of 6. The factors of 6 are 1, 2 and 3. Now, p(2) = 22 – (5 × 2) + 6 = 0 So, y – 2 is a factor of p(y). Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 9__maths__p47__c1", "text": "POLYNOMIALS 35 Also, p(3) = 32 – (5 × 3) + 6 = 0 So, y – 3 is also a factor of y2 – 5y + 6. Therefore, y2 – 5y + 6 = (y – 2)(y – 3) Note that y2 – 5y + 6 can also be factorised by splitting the middle term –5y. Now, let us consider factorising cubic polynomials. Here, the splitting method will not be appropriate to start with. We need to find at least one factor first, as you will see in the following example. Example 10 : Factorise x3 – 23x2 + 142x – 120. Solution : Let p(x) = x3 – 23x2 + 142x – 120 We shall now look for all the factors of –120. Some of these are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±5, ±6, ±8, ±10, ±12, ±15, ±20, ±24, ±30, ±60. By trial, we find that p(1) = 0. So x – 1 is a factor of p(x). Now we see that x3 – 23x2 + 142x – 120 = x3 – x2 – 22x2 + 22x + 120x – 120 = x2(x –1) – 22x(x – 1) + 120(x – 1) (Why?) = (x – 1) (x2 – 22x + 120) [Taking (x – 1) common] We could have also got this by dividing p(x) by x – 1. Now x2 – 22x + 120 can be factorised either by splitting the middle term or by using the Factor theorem. By splitting the middle term, we have: x2 – 22x + 120 = x2 – 12x – 10x + 120 = x(x – 12) – 10(x – 12) = (x – 12) (x – 10) So, x3 – 23x2 – 142x – 120 = (x – 1)(x – 10)(x – 12) EXERCISE 2.3 1.

You also know how to describe the position of a point on the line. There are many other situations, in which to find a point we are required to describe its position with reference to more than one line. For example, consider the following situations: I. In Fig. 3.1, there is a main road running in the East-West direction and streets with numbering from West to East. Also, on each street, house numbers are marked. To look for a friend’s house here, is it enough to know only one reference point? For instance, if we only know that she lives on Street 2, will we be able to find her house easily? Not as easily as when we know two pieces of information about it, namely, the number of the street on which it is situated, and the house number. If we want to reach the house which is situated in the 2nd street and has the number 5, first of all we would identify the 2nd street and then the house numbered 5 on it. In Fig. 3.1, H shows the location of the house. Similarly, P shows the location of the house corresponding to Street number 7 and House number 4. Fig. 3.1 Reprint 2025-26"}

If we ask you to tell us the position of the dot on the paper, how will you do this? Perhaps you will try in some such manner: “The dot is in the upper half of the paper”, or “It is near the left edge of the paper”, or “It is very near the left hand upper corner of the sheet”. Do any of these statements fix the position of the dot precisely? No! But, if you say “ The dot is nearly 5 cm away from the left edge of the paper”, it helps to give some idea but still does not fix the position of the dot. A little thought might enable you to say that the dot is also at a distance of 9 cm above the bottom line. We now know exactly where the dot is! Fig. 3.2 For this purpose, we fixed the position of the dot by specifying its distances from two fixed lines, the left edge of the paper and the bottom line of the paper [Fig.3.2 (b)]. In other words, we need two independent informations for finding the position of the dot. Now, perform the following classroom activity known as ‘Seating Plan’. Activity 1 (Seating Plan) : Draw a plan of the seating in your classroom, pushing all the desks together. Represent each desk by a square. In each square, write the name of the student occupying the desk, which the square represents. Position of each student in the classroom is described precisely by using two independent informations: (i) the column in which she or he sits, (ii) the row in which she or he sits. If you are sitting on the desk lying in the 5th column and 3rd row (represented by the shaded square in Fig. 3.3), your position could be written as (5, 3), first writing the column number, and then the row number. Is this the same as (3, 5)? Write down the names and positions of other students in your class. For example, if Sonia is sitting in the 4th column and 1st row, write S(4,1). The teacher’s desk is not part of your seating plan. We are treating the teacher just as an observer. Reprint 2025-26"}

In case of ‘dot’, we require distance of the dot from bottom line as well as from left edge of the paper. In case of seating plan, we require the number of the column and that of the row. This simple idea has far reaching consequences, and has given rise to a very important branch of Mathematics known as Coordinate Geometry. In this chapter, we aim to introduce some basic concepts of coordinate geometry. You will study more about these in your higher classes. This study was initially developed by the French philosopher and mathematician René Déscartes. René Déscartes, the great French mathematician of the seventeenth century, liked to lie in bed and think! One day, when resting in bed, he solved the problem of describing the position of a point in a plane. His method was a development of the older idea of latitude and longitude. In honour of Déscartes, the system used for describing the position of a point in a plane is also known as the Cartesian system. EXERCISE 3.1 1.

A particular cross-street is made by two streets, one running in the North - South direction and another in the East - West direction. Each cross street is referred to in the following manner : If the 2nd street running in the North - South direction and 5th in the East - West direction meet at some crossing, then we will call this cross-street (2, 5). Using this convention, find: (i) how many cross - streets can be referred to as (4, 3). (ii) how many cross - streets can be referred to as (3, 4). 3.2 Cartesian System You have studied the number line in the chapter on ‘Number System’. On the number line, distances from a fixed point are marked in equal units positively in one direction and negatively in the other. The point from which the distances are marked is called the origin. We use the number line to represent the numbers by marking points on a line at equal distances. If one unit distance represents the number ‘1’, then 3 units distance represents the number ‘3’, ‘0’ being at the origin. The point in the positive direction at a distance r from the origin represents the number r. The point in the negative direction at a distance r from the origin represents the number −r. Locations of different numbers on the number line are shown in Fig. 3.5. Fig. 3.5 Descartes invented the idea of placing two such lines perpendicular to each other on a plane, and locating points on the plane by referring them to these lines. The perpendicular lines may be in any direction such as in Fig.3.6. But, when we choose Fig. 3.6 Reprint 2025-26"}

These lines are actually obtained as follows : Take two number lines, calling them X′X and Y′Y. Place X′X horizontal [as in Fig. 3.7(a)] and write the numbers on it just as written on the number line. We do the same thing with Y′Y except that Y′Y is vertical, not horizontal [Fig. 3.7(b)]. Fig. 3.7 Combine both the lines in such a way that the two lines cross each other at their zeroes, or origins (Fig. 3.8). The horizontal line X′X is called the x - axis and the vertical line YY′ is called the y - axis. The point where X′X and Y′Y cross is called the origin, and is denoted by O. Since the positive numbers lie on the directions OX and OY, OX and OY are called the positive directions of the x - axis and the y - axis, respectively. Similarly, OX′ and OY′ are called the negative directions of the x - axis and the y - axis, respectively. Fig. 3.8 Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 9__maths__p60__c1", "text": "48 MATHEMATICS You observe that the axes (plural of the word ‘axis’) divide the plane into four parts. These four parts are called the quadrants (one fourth part), numbered I, II, III and IV anticlockwise from OX (see Fig.3.9). So, the plane consists of the axes and these quadrants. We call the plane, the Cartesian plane, or the coordinate plane, or the xy-plane. The axes are called the coordinate axes. Now, let us see why this system is so basic to mathematics, and how it is useful. Consider the following diagram where the axes are drawn on graph paper. Let us see the distances of the points P and Q from the axes. For this, we draw perpendiculars PM on the x - axis and PN on the y - axis. Similarly, we draw perpendiculars QR and QS as shown in Fig. 3.10. Fig.3.10 You find that (i) The perpendicular distance of the point P from the y - axis measured along the positive direction of the x - axis is PN = OM = 4 units. (ii) The perpendicular distance of the point P from the x - axis measured along the positive direction of the y - axis is PM = ON = 3 units. Fig. 3.9 Reprint 2025-26"}

(iv) The perpendicular distance of the point Q from the x - axis measured along the negative direction of the y - axis is OS = RQ = 2 units. Now, using these distances, how can we describe the points so that there is no confusion? We write the coordinates of a point, using the following conventions: (i) The x - coordinate of a point is its perpendicular distance from the y - axis measured along the x -axis (positive along the positive direction of the x - axis and negative along the negative direction of the x - axis). For the point P, it is + 4 and for Q, it is – 6. The x - coordinate is also called the abscissa. (ii) The y - coordinate of a point is its perpendicular distance from the x - axis measured along the y - axis (positive along the positive direction of the y - axis and negative along the negative direction of the y - axis). For the point P, it is + 3 and for Q, it is –2. The y - coordinate is also called the ordinate. (iii) In stating the coordinates of a point in the coordinate plane, the x - coordinate comes first, and then the y - coordinate. We place the coordinates in brackets. Hence, the coordinates of P are (4, 3) and the coordinates of Q are (– 6, – 2). Note that the coordinates describe a point in the plane uniquely. (3, 4) is not the same as (4, 3).

Since every point on the x - axis has no distance (zero distance) from the x - axis, therefore, the y - coordinate of every point lying on the x - axis is always zero. Thus, the coordinates of any point on the x - axis are of the form (x, 0), where x is the distance of the point from the y - axis. Similarly, the coordinates of any point on the y - axis are of the form (0, y), where y is the distance of the point from the x - axis. Why? What are the coordinates of the origin O? It has zero distance from both the axes so that its abscissa and ordinate are both zero. Therefore, the coordinates of the origin are (0, 0). In the examples above, you may have observed the following relationship between the signs of the coordinates of a point and the quadrant of a point in which it lies. (i) If a point is in the 1st quadrant, then the point will be in the form (+, +), since the 1st quadrant is enclosed by the positive x - axis and the positive y - axis.

Can you write down a linear equation in one variable? You may say that x + 1 = 0, x + 2 = 0 and 2 y + 3 = 0 are examples of linear equations in one variable. You also know that such equations have a unique (i.e., one and only one) solution. You may also remember how to represent the solution on a number line. In this chapter, the knowledge of linear equations in one variable shall be recalled and extended to that of two variables. You will be considering questions like: Does a linear equation in two variables have a solution? If yes, is it unique? What does the solution look like on the Cartesian plane? You shall also use the concepts you studied in Chapter 3 to answer these questions. 4.2 Linear Equations Let us first recall what you have studied so far. Consider the following equation: 2x + 5 = 0 Its solution, i.e., the root of the equation, is 5 2 − . This can be represented on the number line as shown below: Fig. 4.1 Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 9__maths__p68__c1", "text": "56 MATHEMATICS While solving an equation, you must always keep the following points in mind: The solution of a linear equation is not affected when: (i) the same number is added to (or subtracted from) both the sides of the equation. (ii) you multiply or divide both the sides of the equation by the same non-zero number. Let us now consider the following situation: In a One-day International Cricket match between India and Sri Lanka played in Nagpur, two Indian batsmen together scored 176 runs. Express this information in the form of an equation. Here, you can see that the score of neither of them is known, i.e., there are two unknown quantities. Let us use x and y to denote them. So, the number of runs scored by one of the batsmen is x, and the number of runs scored by the other is y. We know that x + y = 176, which is the required equation. This is an example of a linear equation in two variables. It is customary to denote the variables in such equations by x and y, but other letters may also be used. Some examples of linear equations in two variables are: 1.2s + 3t = 5, p + 4q = 7, πu + 5v = 9 and 3 = 2 x – 7y. Note that you can put these equations in the form 1.2s + 3t – 5 = 0, p + 4q – 7 = 0, πu + 5v – 9 = 0 and 2 x – 7y – 3 = 0, respectively. So, any equation which can be put in the form ax + by + c = 0, where a, b and c are real numbers, and a and b are not both zero, is called a linear equation in two variables. This means that you can think of many many such equations. Example 1 : Write each of the following equations in the form ax + by + c = 0 and indicate the values of a, b and c in each case: (i) 2x + 3y = 4.37 (ii) x – 4 = 3 y (iii) 4 = 5x – 3y (iv) 2x = y Solution : (i) 2x + 3y = 4.37 can be written as 2x + 3y – 4.37 = 0.

Here a = 5, b = –3 and c = – 4. Do you agree that it can also be written as –5x + 3y + 4 = 0 ? In this case a = –5, b = 3 and c = 4. Reprint 2025-26"}

What can you say about the solution of a linear equation involving two variables? As there are two variables in the equation, a solution means a pair of values, one for x and one for y which satisfy the given equation. Let us consider the equation 2x + 3y = 12. Here, x = 3 and y = 2 is a solution because when you substitute x = 3 and y = 2 in the equation above, you find that 2x + 3y = (2 × 3) + (3 × 2) = 12 This solution is written as an ordered pair (3, 2), first writing the value for x and then the value for y. Similarly, (0, 4) is also a solution for the equation above. Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 9__maths__p70__c1", "text": "58 MATHEMATICS On the other hand, (1, 4) is not a solution of 2x + 3y = 12, because on putting x = 1 and y = 4 we get 2x + 3y = 14, which is not 12. Note that (0, 4) is a solution but not (4, 0). You have seen at least two solutions for 2x + 3y = 12, i.e., (3, 2) and (0, 4). Can you find any other solution? Do you agree that (6, 0) is another solution? Verify the same. In fact, we can get many many solutions in the following way. Pick a value of your choice for x (say x = 2) in 2x + 3y = 12. Then the equation reduces to 4 + 3y = 12, which is a linear equation in one variable. On solving this, you get y = 8 3. So 8 2, 3       is another solution of 2x + 3y = 12. Similarly, choosing x = – 5, you find that the equation becomes –10 + 3y = 12. This gives y = 22 3 . So, 22 5, 3   −     is another solution of 2x + 3y = 12. So there is no end to different solutions of a linear equation in two variables. That is, a linear equation in two variables has infinitely many solutions. Example 3 : Find four different solutions of the equation x + 2y = 6. Solution : By inspection, x = 2, y = 2 is a solution because for x = 2, y = 2 x + 2y = 2 + 4 = 6 Now, let us choose x = 0. With this value of x, the given equation reduces to 2y = 6 which has the unique solution y = 3. So x = 0, y = 3 is also a solution of x + 2y = 6. Similarly, taking y = 0, the given equation reduces to x = 6. So, x = 6, y = 0 is a solution of x + 2y = 6 as well. Finally, let us take y = 1. The given equation now reduces to x + 2 = 6, whose solution is given by x = 4. Therefore, (4, 1) is also a solution of the given equation. So four of the infinitely many solutions of the given equation are: (2, 2), (0, 3), (6, 0) and (4, 1). Remark : Note that an easy way of getting a solution is to take x = 0 and get the corresponding value of y. Similarly, we can put y = 0 and obtain the corresponding value of x. Example 4 : Find two solutions for each of the following equations: (i) 4x + 3y = 12 (ii) 2x + 5y = 0 (iii) 3y + 4 = 0 Solution : (i) Taking x = 0, we get 3y = 12, i.e., y = 4. So, (0, 4) is a solution of the given equation. Similarly, by taking y = 0, we get x = 3. Thus, (3, 0) is also a solution. Reprint 2025-26"}

Geometry appears to have originated from the need for measuring land. This branch of mathematics was studied in various forms in every ancient civilisation, be it in Egypt, Babylonia, China, India, Greece, the Incas, etc. The people of these civilisations faced several practical problems which required the development of geometry in various ways. For example, whenever the river Nile overflowed, it wiped out the boundaries between the adjoining fields of different land owners. After such flooding, these boundaries had to be redrawn. For this purpose, the Egyptians developed a number of geometric techniques and rules for calculating simple areas and also for doing simple constructions. The knowledge of geometry was also used by them for computing volumes of granaries, and for constructing canals and pyramids.

It was a highly organised society. The cities were highly developed and very well planned. For example, the roads were parallel to each other and there was an underground drainage system. The houses had many rooms of different types. This shows that the town dwellers were skilled in mensuration and practical arithmetic. The bricks used for constructions were kiln fired and the ratio length : breadth : thickness, of the bricks was found to be 4 : 2 : 1. In ancient India, the Sulbasutras (800 BCE to 500 BCE) were the manuals of geometrical constructions. The geometry of the Vedic period originated with the construction of altars (or vedis) and fireplaces for performing Vedic rites. The location of the sacred fires had to be in accordance to the clearly laid down instructions about their shapes and areas, if they were to be effective instruments. Square and circular altars were used for household rituals, while altars whose shapes were combinations of rectangles, triangles and trapeziums were required for public worship. The sriyantra (given in the Atharvaveda) consists of nine interwoven isosceles triangles. These triangles are arranged in such a way that they produce 43 subsidiary triangles. Though accurate geometric methods were used for the constructions of altars, the principles behind them were not discussed. These examples show that geometry was being developed and applied everywhere in the world. But this was happening in an unsystematic manner. What is interesting about these developments of geometry in the ancient world is that they were passed on from one generation to the next, either orally or through palm leaf messages, or by other ways. Also, we find that in some civilisations like Babylonia, geometry remained a very practical oriented discipline, as was the case in India and Rome. The geometry developed by Egyptians mainly consisted of the statements of results. There were no general rules of the procedure. In fact, Babylonians and Egyptians used geometry mostly for practical purposes and did very little to develop it as a systematic science. But in civilisations like Greece, the emphasis was on the reasoning behind why certain constructions work. The Greeks were interested in establishing the truth of the statements they discovered using deductive reasoning (see Appendix 1). A Greek mathematician, Thales is credited with giving the first known proof. This proof was of the statement that a circle is bisected (i.e., cut into two equal parts) by its diameter. One of Thales’ most famous pupils was Pythagoras (572 BCE), whom you have heard about. Pythagoras and his group discovered many geometric properties and developed the theory of geometry to a great extent. This process continued till 300 BCE. At that time Euclid, a teacher of mathematics at Alexandria in Egypt, collected all the known work and arranged it in his famous treatise, Thales (640 BCE – 546 BCE) Fig. 5.2 Reprint 2025-26"}

These books influenced the whole world’s understanding of geometry for generations to come. In this chapter, we shall discuss Euclid’s approach to geometry and shall try to link it with the present day geometry. 5.2 Euclid’s Definitions, Axioms and Postulates The Greek mathematicians of Euclid’s time thought of geometry as an abstract model of the world in which they lived. The notions of point, line, plane (or surface) and so on were derived from what was seen around them. From studies of the space and solids in the space around them, an abstract geometrical notion of a solid object was developed. A solid has shape, size, position, and can be moved from one place to another. Its boundaries are called surfaces. They separate one part of the space from another, and are said to have no thickness. The boundaries of the surfaces are curves or straight lines. These lines end in points. Consider the three steps from solids to points (solids-surfaces-lines-points). In each step we lose one extension, also called a dimension. So, a solid has three dimensions, a surface has two, a line has one and a point has none. Euclid summarised these statements as definitions. He began his exposition by listing 23 definitions in Book 1 of the ‘Elements’. A few of them are given below : 1. A point is that which has no part. 2. A line is breadthless length. 3. The ends of a line are points. 4. A straight line is a line which lies evenly with the points on itself. 5. A surface is that which has length and breadth only. 6. The edges of a surface are lines. 7. A plane surface is a surface which lies evenly with the straight lines on itself. If you carefully study these definitions, you find that some of the terms like part, breadth, length, evenly, etc. need to be further explained clearly. For example, consider his definition of a point. In this definition, ‘a part’ needs to be defined. Suppose if you define ‘a part’ to be that which occupies ‘area’, again ‘an area’ needs to be defined. So, to define one thing, you need to define many other things, and you may get a long chain of definitions without an end. For such reasons, mathematicians agree to leave Euclid (325 BCE – 265 BCE) Fig. 5.3 Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 9__maths__p75__c1", "text": "INTRODUCTION TO EUCLID’S GEOMETRY 63 some geometric terms undefined. However, we do have a intuitive feeling for the geometric concept of a point than what the ‘definition’ above gives us. So, we represent a point as a dot, even though a dot has some dimension. A similar problem arises in Definition 2 above, since it refers to breadth and length, neither of which has been defined. Because of this, a few terms are kept undefined while developing any course of study. So, in geometry, we take a point, a line and a plane (in Euclid‘s words a plane surface) as undefined terms. The only thing is that we can represent them intuitively, or explain them with the help of ‘physical models’. Starting with his definitions, Euclid assumed certain properties, which were not to be proved. These assumptions are actually ‘obvious universal truths’. He divided them into two types: axioms and postulates. He used the term ‘postulate’ for the assumptions that were specific to geometry. Common notions (often called axioms), on the other hand, were assumptions used throughout mathematics and not specifically linked to geometry. For details about axioms and postulates, refer to Appendix 1. Some of Euclid’s axioms, not in his order, are given below : (1) Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another. (2) If equals are added to equals, the wholes are equal. (3) If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal. (4) Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another. (5) The whole is greater than the part. (6) Things which are double of the same things are equal to one another. (7) Things which are halves of the same things are equal to one another. These ‘common notions’ refer to magnitudes of some kind. The first common notion could be applied to plane figures. For example, if an area of a triangle equals the area of a rectangle and the area of the rectangle equals that of a square, then the area of the triangle also equals the area of the square. Magnitudes of the same kind can be compared and added, but magnitudes of different kinds cannot be compared. For example, a line cannot be compared to a rectangle, nor can an angle be compared to a pentagon. The 4th axiom given above seems to say that if two things are identical (that is, they are the same), then they are equal. In other words, everything equals itself. It is the justification of the principle of superposition. Axiom (5) gives us the definition of ‘greater than’. For example, if a quantity B is a part of another quantity A, then A can be written as the sum of B and some third quantity C. Symbolically, A > B means that there is some C such that A = B + C.

{"id": "class 9__maths__p76__c1", "text": "64 MATHEMATICS Now let us discuss Euclid’s five postulates. They are : Postulate 1 : A straight line may be drawn from any one point to any other point. Note that this postulate tells us that at least one straight line passes through two distinct points, but it does not say that there cannot be more than one such line. However, in his work, Euclid has frequently assumed, without mentioning, that there is a unique line joining two distinct points. We state this result in the form of an axiom as follows: Axiom 5.1 : Given two distinct points, there is a unique line that passes through them. How many lines passing through P also pass through Q (see Fig. 5.4)? Only one, that is, the line PQ. How many lines passing through Q also pass through P? Only one, that is, the line PQ. Thus, the statement above is self-evident, and so is taken as an axiom. Fig. 5.4 Postulate 2 : A terminated line can be produced indefinitely. Note that what we call a line segment now-a-days is what Euclid called a terminated line. So, according to the present day terms, the second postulate says that a line segment can be extended on either side to form a line (see Fig. 5.5). Fig. 5.5 Postulate 3 : A circle can be drawn with any centre and any radius. Postulate 4 : All right angles are equal to one another. Postulate 5 : If a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same side of it taken together less than two right angles, then the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which the sum of angles is less than two right angles.

{"id": "class 9__maths__p77__c1", "text": "INTRODUCTION TO EUCLID’S GEOMETRY 65 For example, the line PQ in Fig. 5.6 falls on lines AB and CD such that the sum of the interior angles 1 and 2 is less than 180° on the left side of PQ. Therefore, the lines AB and CD will eventually intersect on the left side of PQ. A brief look at the five postulates brings to your notice that Postulate 5 is far more complex than any other postulate. On the other hand, Postulates 1 through 4 are so simple and obvious that these are taken as ‘self-evident truths’. However, it is not possible to prove them. So, these statements are accepted without any proof (see Appendix 1). Because of its complexity, the fifth postulate will be given more attention in the next section. Now-a-days, ‘postulates’ and ‘axioms’ are terms that are used interchangeably and in the same sense. ‘Postulate’ is actually a verb. When we say “let us postulate”, we mean, “let us make some statement based on the observed phenomenon in the Universe”. Its truth/validity is checked afterwards. If it is true, then it is accepted as a ‘Postulate’. A system of axioms is called consistent (see Appendix 1), if it is impossible to deduce from these axioms a statement that contradicts any axiom or previously proved statement. So, when any system of axioms is given, it needs to be ensured that the system is consistent. After Euclid stated his postulates and axioms, he used them to prove other results. Then using these results, he proved some more results by applying deductive reasoning. The statements that were proved are called propositions or theorems. Euclid deduced 465 propositions in a logical chain using his axioms, postulates, definitions and theorems proved earlier in the chain. In the next few chapters on geometry, you will be using these axioms to prove some theorems. Now, let us see in the following examples how Euclid used his axioms and postulates for proving some of the results: Example 1 : If A, B and C are three points on a line, and B lies between A and C (see Fig. 5.7), then prove that AB + BC = AC.

{"id": "class 9__maths__p78__c1", "text": "66 MATHEMATICS Solution : In the figure given above, AC coincides with AB + BC. Also, Euclid’s Axiom (4) says that things which coincide with one another are equal to one another. So, it can be deduced that AB + BC = AC Note that in this solution, it has been assumed that there is a unique line passing through two points. Example 2 : Prove that an equilateral triangle can be constructed on any given line segment. Solution : In the statement above, a line segment of any length is given, say AB [see Fig. 5.8(i)]. Fig. 5.8 Here, you need to do some construction. Using Euclid’s Postulate 3, you can draw a circle with point A as the centre and AB as the radius [see Fig. 5.8(ii)]. Similarly, draw another circle with point B as the centre and BA as the radius. The two circles meet at a point, say C. Now, draw the line segments AC and BC to form ∆ ABC [see Fig. 5.8 (iii)]. So, you have to prove that this triangle is equilateral, i.e., AB = AC = BC. Now, AB = AC, since they are the radii of the same circle (1) Similarly, AB = BC (Radii of the same circle) (2) From these two facts, and Euclid’s axiom that things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another, you can conclude that AB = BC = AC. So, ∆ ABC is an equilateral triangle. Note that here Euclid has assumed, without mentioning anywhere, that the two circles drawn with centres A and B will meet each other at a point.

For the time being, let us suppose that the two lines intersect in two distinct points, say P and Q. So, you have two lines passing through two distinct points P and Q. But this assumption clashes with the axiom that only one line can pass through two distinct points.

You have also studied some axioms and, with the help of these axioms, you proved some other statements. In this chapter, you will study the properties of the angles formed when two lines intersect each other, and also the properties of the angles formed when a line intersects two or more parallel lines at distinct points. Further you will use these properties to prove some statements using deductive reasoning (see Appendix 1). You have already verified these statements through some activities in the earlier classes. In your daily life, you see different types of angles formed between the edges of plane surfaces. For making a similar kind of model using the plane surfaces, you need to have a thorough knowledge of angles. For instance, suppose you want to make a model of a hut to keep in the school exhibition using bamboo sticks. Imagine how you would make it? You would keep some of the sticks parallel to each other, and some sticks would be kept slanted. Whenever an architect has to draw a plan for a multistoried building, she has to draw intersecting lines and parallel lines at different angles. Without the knowledge of the properties of these lines and angles, do you think she can draw the layout of the building? In science, you study the properties of light by drawing the ray diagrams. For example, to study the refraction property of light when it enters from one medium to the other medium, you use the properties of intersecting lines and parallel lines. When two or more forces act on a body, you draw the diagram in which forces are represented by directed line segments to study the net effect of the forces on the body. At that time, you need to know the relation between the angles when the rays (or line segments) are parallel to or intersect each other.

In the subsequent chapters of geometry, you will be using these properties of lines and angles to deduce more and more useful properties. Let us first revise the terms and definitions related to lines and angles learnt in earlier classes. 6.2 Basic Terms and Definitions Recall that a part (or portion) of a line with two end points is called a line-segment and a part of a line with one end point is called a ray. Note that the line segment AB is denoted by AB , and its length is denoted by AB. The ray AB is denoted by AB \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002 , and a line is denoted by AB \u0003\u0001\u0001\u0002 . However, we will not use these symbols, and will denote the line segment AB, ray AB, length AB and line AB by the same symbol, AB. The meaning will be clear from the context. Sometimes small letters l, m, n, etc. will be used to denote lines. If three or more points lie on the same line, they are called collinear points; otherwise they are called non-collinear points. Recall that an angle is formed when two rays originate from the same end point. The rays making an angle are called the arms of the angle and the end point is called the vertex of the angle. You have studied different types of angles, such as acute angle, right angle, obtuse angle, straight angle and reflex angle in earlier classes (see Fig. 6.1). (i) acute angle : 0° < x < 90° (ii) right angle : y = 90° (iii) obtuse angle : 90° < z < 180° (iv) straight angle : s = 180° (v) reflex angle : 180° < t < 360° Fig. 6.1 : Types of Angles Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 9__maths__p83__c1", "text": "LINES AND ANGLES 71 An acute angle measures between 0° and 90°, whereas a right angle is exactly equal to 90°. An angle greater than 90° but less than 180° is called an obtuse angle. Also, recall that a straight angle is equal to 180°. An angle which is greater than 180° but less than 360° is called a reflex angle. Further, two angles whose sum is 90° are called complementary angles, and two angles whose sum is 180° are called supplementary angles. You have also studied about adjacent angles in the earlier classes (see Fig. 6.2). Two angles are adjacent, if they have a common vertex, a common arm and their non-common arms are on different sides of the common arm. In Fig. 6.2, ∠ ABD and ∠ DBC are adjacent angles. Ray BD is their common arm and point B is their common vertex. Ray BA and ray BC are non common arms. Moreover, when two angles are adjacent, then their sum is always equal to the angle formed by the two non- common arms. So, we can write ∠ ABC = ∠ ABD + ∠ DBC. Note that ∠ ABC and ∠ ABD are not adjacent angles. Why? Because their non- common arms BD and BC lie on the same side of the common arm BA. If the non-common arms BA and BC in Fig. 6.2, form a line then it will look like Fig. 6.3. In this case, ∠ ABD and ∠ DBC are called linear pair of angles. You may also recall the vertically opposite angles formed when two lines, say AB and CD, intersect each other, say at the point O (see Fig. 6.4). There are two pairs of vertically opposite angles. One pair is ∠AOD and ∠BOC. Can you find the other pair? Fig. 6.2 : Adjacent angles Fig. 6.3 : Linear pair of angles Fig. 6.4 : Vertically opposite angles Reprint 2025-26"}

This equal length is called the distance between two parallel lines. 6.4 Pairs of Angles In Section 6.2, you have learnt the definitions of some of the pairs of angles such as complementary angles, supplementary angles, adjacent angles, linear pair of angles, etc. Can you think of some relations between these angles? Now, let us find out the relation between the angles formed when a ray stands on a line. Draw a figure in which a ray stands on a line as shown in Fig. 6.6. Name the line as AB and the ray as OC. What are the angles formed at the point O? They are ∠ AOC, ∠ BOC and ∠ AOB. Can we write ∠ AOC + ∠ BOC = ∠ AOB? (1) Yes! (Why? Refer to adjacent angles in Section 6.2) What is the measure of ∠ AOB? It is 180°. (Why?) (2) From (1) and (2), can you say that ∠ AOC + ∠ BOC = 180°? Yes! (Why?)

{"id": "class 9__maths__p85__c1", "text": "LINES AND ANGLES 73 Axiom 6.1 : If a ray stands on a line, then the sum of two adjacent angles so formed is 180°. Recall that when the sum of two adjacent angles is 180°, then they are called a linear pair of angles. In Axiom 6.1, it is given that ‘a ray stands on a line’. From this ‘given’, we have concluded that ‘the sum of two adjacent angles so formed is 180°’. Can we write Axiom 6.1 the other way? That is, take the ‘conclusion’ of Axiom 6.1 as ‘given’ and the ‘given’ as the ‘conclusion’. So it becomes: (A) If the sum of two adjacent angles is 180°, then a ray stands on a line (that is, the non-common arms form a line). Now you see that the Axiom 6.1 and statement (A) are in a sense the reverse of each others. We call each as converse of the other. We do not know whether the statement (A) is true or not. Let us check. Draw adjacent angles of different measures as shown in Fig. 6.7. Keep the ruler along one of the non-common arms in each case. Does the other non-common arm also lie along the ruler?

Also see that ∠ AOC + ∠ COB = 125° + 55° = 180°. From this, you may conclude that statement (A) is true. So, you can state in the form of an axiom as follows: Axiom 6.2 : If the sum of two adjacent angles is 180°, then the non-common arms of the angles form a line. For obvious reasons, the two axioms above together is called the Linear Pair Axiom. Let us now examine the case when two lines intersect each other. Recall, from earlier classes, that when two lines intersect, the vertically opposite angles are equal. Let us prove this result now. See Appendix 1 for the ingredients of a proof, and keep those in mind while studying the proof given below. Theorem 6.1 : If two lines intersect each other, then the vertically opposite angles are equal. Proof : In the statement above, it is given that ‘two lines intersect each other’. So, let AB and CD be two lines intersecting at O as shown in Fig. 6.8. They lead to two pairs of vertically opposite angles, namely, (i) ∠ AOC and ∠ BOD (ii) ∠ AOD and ∠ BOC. We need to prove that ∠ AOC = ∠ BOD and ∠ AOD = ∠ BOC. Now, ray OA stands on line CD. Therefore, ∠ AOC + ∠ AOD = 180° (Linear pair axiom) (1) Can we write ∠ AOD + ∠ BOD = 180°? Yes! (Why?) (2) From (1) and (2), we can write ∠ AOC + ∠ AOD = ∠ AOD + ∠ BOD This implies that ∠ AOC = ∠ BOD (Refer Section 5.2, Axiom 3) Similarly, it can be proved that ∠AOD = ∠BOC Now, let us do some examples based on Linear Pair Axiom and Theorem 6.1.

{"id": "class 9__maths__p95__c1", "text": "CHAPTER 7 TRIANGLES 7.1 Introduction You have studied about triangles and their various properties in your earlier classes. You know that a closed figure formed by three intersecting lines is called a triangle. (‘Tri’ means ‘three’). A triangle has three sides, three angles and three vertices. For example, in triangle ABC, denoted as ∆ ABC (see Fig. 7.1); AB, BC, CA are the three sides, ∠ A, ∠ B, ∠ C are the three angles and A, B, C are three vertices. In Chapter 6, you have also studied some properties of triangles. In this chapter, you will study in details about the congruence of triangles, rules of congruence, some more properties of triangles and inequalities in a triangle. You have already verified most of these properties in earlier classes. We will now prove some of them. 7.2 Congruence of Triangles You must have observed that two copies of your photographs of the same size are identical. Similarly, two bangles of the same size, two ATM cards issued by the same bank are identical. You may recall that on placing a one rupee coin on another minted in the same year, they cover each other completely. Do you remember what such figures are called? Indeed they are called congruent figures (‘congruent’ means equal in all respects or figures whose shapes and sizes are both the same). Now, draw two circles of the same radius and place one on the other. What do you observe? They cover each other completely and we call them as congruent circles. Fig. 7.1 Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 9__maths__p96__c1", "text": "84 MATHEMATICS Repeat this activity by placing one square on the other with sides of the same measure (see Fig. 7.2) or by placing two equilateral triangles of equal sides on each other. You will observe that the squares are congruent to each other and so are the equilateral triangles. You may wonder why we are studying congruence. You all must have seen the ice tray in your refrigerator. Observe that the moulds for making ice are all congruent. The cast used for moulding in the tray also has congruent depressions (may be all are rectangular or all circular or all triangular). So, whenever identical objects have to be produced, the concept of congruence is used in making the cast. Sometimes, you may find it difficult to replace the refill in your pen by a new one and this is so when the new refill is not of the same size as the one you want to remove. Obviously, if the two refills are identical or congruent, the new refill fits. So, you can find numerous examples where congruence of objects is applied in daily life situations. Can you think of some more examples of congruent figures? Now, which of the following figures are not congruent to the square in Fig 7.3 (i) : Fig. 7.3 The large squares in Fig. 7.3 (ii) and (iii) are obviously not congruent to the one in Fig 7.3 (i), but the square in Fig 7.3 (iv) is congruent to the one given in Fig 7.3 (i).

Observe that triangles in Fig. 7.4 (ii), (iii) and (iv) are congruent to ∆ ABC while ∆ TSU of Fig 7.4 (v) is not congruent to ∆ ABC. If ∆ PQR is congruent to ∆ ABC, we write ∆ PQR ≅ ∆ ABC. Notice that when ∆ PQR ≅ ∆ ABC, then sides of ∆ PQR fall on corresponding equal sides of ∆ ABC and so is the case for the angles. That is, PQ covers AB, QR covers BC and RP covers CA; ∠ P covers ∠ A, ∠ Q covers ∠ B and ∠ R covers ∠ C. Also, there is a one-one correspondence between the vertices. That is, P corresponds to A, Q to B, R to C and so on which is written as P ↔ A, Q ↔ B, R ↔ C Note that under this correspondence, ∆ PQR ≅ ∆ ABC; but it will not be correct to write ∆QRP ≅ ∆ ABC.

Note that in congruent triangles corresponding parts are equal and we write in short ‘CPCT’ for corresponding parts of congruent triangles. 7.3 Criteria for Congruence of Triangles In earlier classes, you have learnt four criteria for congruence of triangles. Let us recall them. Draw two triangles with one side 3 cm. Are these triangles congruent? Observe that they are not congruent (see Fig. 7.5).

So, equality of one pair of sides or one pair of sides and one pair of angles is not sufficient to give us congruent triangles. What would happen if the other pair of arms (sides) of the equal angles are also equal? In Fig 7.7, BC = QR, ∠ B = ∠ Q and also, AB = PQ. Now, what can you say about congruence of ∆ABC and ∆PQR? Recall from your earlier classes that, in this case, the two triangles are congruent. Verify this for ∆ ABC and ∆ PQR in Fig. 7.7. Repeat this activity with other pairs of triangles. Do you observe that the equality of two sides and the included angle is enough for the congruence of triangles? Yes, it is enough. Fig. 7.7 This is the first criterion for congruence of triangles. Axiom 7.1 (SAS congruence rule) : Two triangles are congruent if two sides and the included angle of one triangle are equal to the two sides and the included angle of the other triangle. This result cannot be proved with the help of previously known results and so it is accepted true as an axiom (see Appendix 1). Let us now take some examples. Example 1 : In Fig. 7.8, OA = OB and OD = OC. Show that (i) ∆ AOD ≅ ∆ BOC and (ii) AD || BC.

So, ∆ AOD ≅∆ BOC (by the SAS congruence rule) (ii) In congruent triangles AOD and BOC, the other corresponding parts are also equal. So, ∠ OAD = ∠ OBC and these form a pair of alternate angles for line segments AD and BC. Therefore, AD || BC. Example 2 : AB is a line segment and line l is its perpendicular bisector. If a point P lies on l, show that P is equidistant from A and B. Solution : Line l ⊥ AB and passes through C which is the mid-point of AB (see Fig. 7.9). You have to show that PA = PB. Consider ∆ PCA and ∆ PCB. We have AC = BC (C is the mid-point of AB) ∠ PCA = ∠ PCB = 90° (Given) PC = PC (Common) So, ∆ PCA ≅ ∆ PCB (SAS rule) and so, PA = PB, as they are corresponding sides of congruent triangles. Now, let us construct two triangles, whose sides are 4 cm and 5 cm and one of the angles is 50° and this angle is not included in between the equal sides (see Fig. 7.10).

Next, try to construct the two triangles in which two angles are 60° and 45° and the side included between these angles is 4 cm (see Fig. 7.11). Fig. 7.11 Cut out these triangles and place one triangle on the other. What do you observe? See that one triangle covers the other completely; that is, the two triangles are congruent. Repeat this activity with more pairs of triangles. You will observe that equality of two angles and the included side is sufficient for congruence of triangles. This result is the Angle-Side-Angle criterion for congruence and is written as ASA criterion. You have verified this criterion in earlier classes, but let us state and prove this result. Since this result can be proved, it is called a theorem and to prove it, we use the SAS axiom for congruence.

Suppose, now in two triangles two pairs of angles and one pair of corresponding sides are equal but the side is not included between the corresponding equal pairs of angles. Are the triangles still congruent? You will observe that they are congruent. Can you reason out why? You know that the sum of the three angles of a triangle is 180°. So if two pairs of angles are equal, the third pair is also equal (180° – sum of equal angles). So, two triangles are congruent if any two pairs of angles and one pair of corresponding sides are equal. We may call it as the AAS Congruence Rule. Now let us perform the following activity : Draw triangles with angles 40°, 50° and 90°. How many such triangles can you draw?

A quadrilateral has four sides, four angles and four vertices. A parallelogram is a quadrilateral in which both pairs of opposite sides are parallel. Let us perform an activity. Cut out a parallelogram from a sheet of paper and cut it along a diagonal (see Fig. 8.1). You obtain two triangles. What can you say about these triangles? Place one triangle over the other. Turn one around, if necessary. What do you observe? Observe that the two triangles are congruent to each other. Repeat this activity with some more parallelograms. Each time you will observe that each diagonal divides the parallelogram into two congruent triangles. Let us now prove this result. Theorem 8.1 : A diagonal of a parallelogram divides it into two congruent triangles. Proof : Let ABCD be a parallelogram and AC be a diagonal (see Fig. 8.2).

Now, measure the opposite sides of parallelogram ABCD. What do you observe? You will find that AB = DC and AD = BC. This is another property of a parallelogram stated below: Theorem 8.2 : In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. You have already proved that a diagonal divides the parallelogram into two congruent triangles; so what can you say about the corresponding parts say, the corresponding sides? They are equal. So, AB = DC and AD = BC Now what is the converse of this result? You already know that whatever is given in a theorem, the same is to be proved in the converse and whatever is proved in the theorem it is given in the converse. Thus, Theorem 8.2 can be stated as given below : If a quadrilateral is a parallelogram, then each pair of its opposite sides is equal. So its converse is : Theorem 8.3 : If each pair of opposite sides of a quadrilateral is equal, then it is a parallelogram. Can you reason out why?

Repeat this with some more parallelograms. We arrive at yet another result as given below. Theorem 8.4 : In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. Now, is the converse of this result also true? Yes. Using the angle sum property of a quadrilateral and the results of parallel lines intersected by a transversal, we can see that the converse is also true. So, we have the following theorem : Theorem 8.5 : If in a quadrilateral, each pair of opposite angles is equal, then it is a parallelogram. There is yet another property of a parallelogram. Let us study the same. Draw a parallelogram ABCD and draw both its diagonals intersecting at the point O (see Fig. 8.4). Measure the lengths of OA, OB, OC and OD. What do you observe?

Proof : You are given two equal chords AB and CD of a circle with centre O (see Fig.9.4). You want to prove that ∠ AOB = ∠ COD. In triangles AOB and COD, OA = OC (Radii of a circle) OB = OD (Radii of a circle) AB = CD (Given) Therefore, ∆ AOB ≅∆ COD (SSS rule) This gives ∠ AOB = ∠ COD (Corresponding parts of congruent triangles) Remark : For convenience, the abbreviation CPCT will be used in place of ‘Corresponding parts of congruent triangles’, because we use this very frequently as you will see. Now if two chords of a circle subtend equal angles at the centre, what can you say about the chords? Are they equal or not?

Then, ∠ OMA = ∠ OMB = 90° or OM is perpendicular to AB. Does the point B coincide with A (see Fig.9.6)? Yes it will. So MA = MB.

To write this, first let us be clear what is assumed in Theorem 9.3 and what is proved. Given that the perpendicular from the centre of a circle to a chord is drawn and to prove that it bisects the chord.

Since there are infinite numbers of points on a line, if you join these points to P, you will get infinitely many line segments PL1, PL2, PM, PL3, PL4, etc. Which of these is the distance of AB from P? You may think a while and get the answer. Out of these line segments, the perpendicular from P to AB, namely PM in Fig. 9.8, will be the least.

Fold the figure so that D falls on B and C falls on A [see Fig.9.9 (i)]. You may observe that O lies on the crease and N falls on M. Therefore, OM = ON. Repeat the activity by drawing congruent circles with centres O and O′ and taking equal chords AB and CD one on each. Draw perpendiculars OM and O′N on them [see Fig. 9.9(ii)]. Cut one circular disc and put it on the other so that AB coincides with CD. Then you will find that O coincides with O′ and M coincides with N. In this way you verified the following: Theorem 9.5 : Equal chords of a circle (or of congruent circles) are equidistant from the centre (or centres). Next, it will be seen whether the converse of this theorem is true or not. For this, draw a circle with centre O. From the centre O, draw two line segments OL and OM of equal length and lying inside the circle [see Fig. 9.10(i)]. Then draw chords PQ and RS of the circle perpendicular to OL and OM respectively [see Fig 9.10(ii)]. Measure the lengths of PQ and RS. Are these different? No, both are equal. Repeat the activity for more equal line segments and drawing the chords perpendicular to them. This verifies the converse of the Theorem 9.5 which is stated as follows: Reprint 2025-26"}

Solution : Given that AB and CD are two chords of a circle, with centre O intersecting at a point E. PQ is a diameter through E, such that ∠ AEQ = ∠ DEQ (see Fig.9.11).

If you take two equal chords, what can you say about the size of arcs? Is one arc made by first chord equal to the corresponding arc made by another chord? In fact, they are more than just equal in length. They are congruent in the sense that if one arc is put on the other, without bending or twisting, one superimposes the other completely. You can verify this fact by cutting the arc, corresponding to the chord CD from the circle along CD and put it on the corresponding arc made by equal chord AB. You will find that the arc CD superimpose the arc AB completely (see Fig. 9.13). This shows that equal chords make congruent arcs and conversely congruent arcs make equal chords of a circle. You can state it as follows: If two chords of a circle are equal, then their corresponding arcs are congruent and conversely, if two arcs are congruent, then their corresponding chords are equal.

Therefore, in Fig 9.14, the angle subtended by the minor arc PQ at O is ∠POQ and the angle subtended by the major arc PQ at O is reflex angle POQ. In view of the property above and Theorem 9.1, the following result is true: Congruent arcs (or equal arcs) of a circle subtend equal angles at the centre. Therefore, the angle subtended by a chord of a circle at its centre is equal to the angle subtended by the corresponding (minor) arc at the centre. The following theorem gives the relationship between the angles subtended by an arc at the centre and at a point on the circle. Theorem 9.7 : The angle subtended by an arc at the centre is double the angle subtended by it at any point on the remaining part of the circle. Proof : Given an arc PQ of a circle subtending angles POQ at the centre O and PAQ at a point A on the remaining part of the circle. We need to prove that ∠ POQ = 2 ∠ PAQ.

Then ∠ PAQ is also called the angle formed in the segment PAQP. In Theorem 9.7, A can be any point on the remaining part of the circle. So if you take any other point C on the remaining part of the circle (see Fig. 9.16), you have ∠ POQ = 2 ∠ PCQ = 2 ∠ PAQ Therefore, ∠ PCQ = ∠ PAQ. This proves the following: Theorem 9.8 : Angles in the same segment of a circle are equal. Again let us discuss the case (ii) of Theorem 10.8 separately. Here ∠PAQ is an angle in the segment, which is a semicircle. Also, ∠ PAQ = 1 2 ∠ POQ = 1 2 × 180° = 90°. If you take any other point C on the semicircle, again you get that ∠ PCQ = 90° Therefore, you find another property of the circle as: Angle in a semicircle is a right angle. The converse of Theorem 9.8 is also true. It can be stated as: Theorem 9.9 : If a line segment joining two points subtends equal angles at two other points lying on the same side of the line containing the line segment, the four points lie on a circle (i.e. they are concyclic).

Now suppose that we know the lengths of the sides of a scalene triangle and not the height. Can you still find its area? For instance, you have a triangular park whose sides are 40 m, 32 m, and 24 m. How will you calculate its area? Definitely if you want to apply the formula, you will have to calculate its height. But we do not have a clue to calculate the height. Try doing so. If you are not able to get it, then go to the next section. Heron was born in about 10AD possibly in Alexandria in Egypt. He worked in applied mathematics. His works on mathematical and physical subjects are so numerous and varied that he is considered to be an encyclopedic writer in these fields. His geometrical works deal largely with problems on mensuration written in three books. Book I deals with the area of squares, rectangles, triangles, trapezoids (trapezia), various other specialised quadrilaterals, the regular polygons, circles, surfaces of cylinders, cones, spheres etc. In this book, Heron has derived the famous formula for the area of a triangle in terms of its three sides. The formula given by Heron about the area of a triangle, is also known as Hero’s formula. It is stated as: Area of a triangle = ( ) ( ) ( ) s s a s b s c − − − (I) Heron (10 C.E. – 75 C.E.)

So, Curved Surface Area of a Cone = 1 2 × l × 2πr = πrl where r is its base radius and l its slant height. Note that l2 = r2 + h2 (as can be seen from Fig. 11.4), by applying Pythagoras Theorem. Here h is the height of the cone. Therefore, l = 2 2 r h + Now if the base of the cone is to be closed, then a circular piece of paper of radius r is also required whose area is πr2.

If each 1 cm2 of the surface of the cob carries an average of four grains, find how many grains you would find on the entire cob. Solution : Since the grains of corn are found only on the curved surface of the corn cob, we would need to know the curved surface area of the corn cob to find the total number of grains on it. In this question, we are given the height of the cone, so we need to find its slant height. Here, l = 2 2 r h + = 2 2 (2.1) 20 + cm = 404.41 cm = 20.11 cm Therefore, the curved surface area of the corn cob = πrl = 22 7 × 2.1 × 20.11 cm2 = 132.726 cm2 = 132.73 cm2 (approx.)

Yes, you can, because a circle is a plane closed figure whose every point lies at a constant distance (called radius) from a fixed point, which is called the centre of the circle. Now if you paste a string along a diameter of a circular disc and rotate it as you had rotated the triangle in the previous section, you see a new solid (see Fig 11.6). What does it resemble? A ball? Yes. It is called a sphere. Fig. 11.6 Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 9__maths__p154__c1", "text": "142 MATHEMATICS Can you guess what happens to the centre of the circle, when it forms a sphere on rotation? Of course, it becomes the centre of the sphere. So, a sphere is a three dimensional figure (solid figure), which is made up of all points in the space, which lie at a constant distance called the radius, from a fixed point called the centre of the sphere. Note : A sphere is like the surface of a ball. The word solid sphere is used for the solid whose surface is a sphere. Activity : Have you ever played with a top or have you at least watched someone play with one? You must be aware of how a string is wound around it. Now, let us take a rubber ball and drive a nail into it. Taking support of the nail, let us wind a string around the ball. When you have reached the ‘fullest’ part of the ball, use pins to keep the string in place, and continue to wind the string around the remaining part of the ball, till you have completely covered the ball [see Fig. 11.7(a)]. Mark the starting and finishing points on the string, and slowly unwind the string from the surface of the ball. Now, ask your teacher to help you in measuring the diameter of the ball, from which you easily get its radius. Then on a sheet of paper, draw four circles with radius equal to the radius of the ball. Start filling the circles one by one, with the string you had wound around the ball [see Fig. 11.7(b)]. Fig. 11.7 What have you achieved in all this? The string, which had completely covered the surface area of the sphere, has been used to completely fill the regions of four circles, all of the same radius as of the sphere.

There is only one, which is curved. Now, let us take a solid sphere, and slice it exactly ‘through the middle’ with a plane that passes through its centre. What happens to the sphere? Yes, it gets divided into two equal parts (see Fig. 11.8)! What will each half be called? It is called a hemisphere. (Because ‘hemi’ also means ‘half’) And what about the surface of a hemisphere? How many faces does it have? Two! There is a curved face and a flat face (base). The curved surface area of a hemisphere is half the surface area of the sphere, which is 1 2 of 4πr2.

Find the area available to the motorcyclist for riding. Solution : Diameter of the sphere = 7 m. Therefore, radius is 3.5 m.

If the circumference of the base of the dome is 17.6 m, find the cost of painting it, given the cost of painting is ` 5 per 100 cm2. Solution : Since only the rounded surface of the dome is to be painted, we would need to find the curved surface area of the hemisphere to know the extent of painting that needs to be done. Now, circumference of the dome = 17.6 m. Therefore, 17.6 = 2πr. So, the radius of the dome = 17.6 × 7 2 22 × m = 2.8 m The curved surface area of the dome = 2πr2 = 2 × 22 7 × 2.8 × 2.8 m2 = 49.28 m2 Now, cost of painting 100 cm2 is ` 5.

{"id": "class 9__maths__p158__c1", "text": "146 MATHEMATICS So, let us start like this. Fill the cone up to the brim with sand once, and empty it into the cylinder. We find that it fills up only a part of the cylinder [see Fig. 11.12(a)]. When we fill up the cone again to the brim, and empty it into the cylinder, we see that the cylinder is still not full [see Fig. 11.12(b)]. When the cone is filled up for the third time, and emptied into the cylinder, it can be seen that the cylinder is also full to the brim [see Fig. 11.12(c)]. With this, we can safely come to the conclusion that three times the volume of a cone, makes up the volume of a cylinder, which has the same base radius and the same height as the cone, which means that the volume of the cone is one-third the volume of the cylinder. So, Volume of a Cone = 1 3 πr2h where r is the base radius and h is the height of the cone. Example 8 : The height and the slant height of a cone are 21 cm and 28 cm respectively.

She uses it to have a conical tent made, with a base radius of 7 m. Assuming that all the stitching margins and the wastage incurred while cutting, amounts to approximately 1 m2, find the volume of the tent that can be made with it. Solution : Since the area of the canvas = 551 m2 and area of the canvas lost in wastage is 1 m2, therefore the area of canvas available for making the tent is (551 – 1) m2 = 550 m2. Now, the surface area of the tent = 550 m2 and the required base radius of the conical tent = 7 m Note that a tent has only a curved surface (the floor of a tent is not covered by canvas!!).

First, take two or three spheres of different radii, and a container big enough to be able to put each of the spheres into it, one at a time. Also, take a large trough in which you can place the container. Then, fill the container up to the brim with water [see Fig. 11.13(a)]. Now, carefully place one of the spheres in the container. Some of the water from the container will over flow into the trough in which it is kept [see Fig. 11.13(b)]. Carefully pour out the water from the trough into a measuring cylinder (i.e., a graduated cylindrical jar) and measure the water over flowed [see Fig. 11.13(c)]. Suppose the radius of the immersed sphere is r (you can find the radius by measuring the diameter of the sphere). Then evaluate 4 3 πr3. Do you find this value almost equal to the measure of the volume over flowed? Fig. 11.13 Once again repeat the procedure done just now, with a different size of sphere. Find the radius R of this sphere and then calculate the value of 3 4 R . 3 π Once again this value is nearly equal to the measure of the volume of the water displaced (over flowed) by the sphere. What does this tell us? We know that the volume of the sphere is the same as the measure of the volume of the water displaced by it. By doing this experiment repeatedly with spheres of varying radii, we are getting the same result, namely, the volume of a sphere is equal to 4 3 π times the cube of its radius. This gives us the idea that Volume of a Sphere = 3 4 3 r π where r is the radius of the sphere. Later, in higher classes it can be proved also. But at this stage, we will just take it as true.

Now let us turn our attention to another representation of data, i.e., the graphical representation. It is well said that one picture is better than a thousand words. Usually comparisons among the individual items are best shown by means of graphs. The representation then becomes easier to understand than the actual data. We shall study the following graphical representations in this section. (A) Bar graphs (B) Histograms of uniform width, and of varying widths (C) Frequency polygons (A) Bar Graphs In earlier classes, you have already studied and constructed bar graphs. Here we shall discuss them through a more formal approach. Recall that a bar graph is a pictorial representation of data in which usually bars of uniform width are drawn with equal spacing between them on one axis (say, the x-axis), depicting the variable. The values of the variable are shown on the other axis (say, the y-axis) and the heights of the bars depend on the values of the variable.

(i) 4 students were born in the month of November. (ii) The Maximum number of students were born in the month of August. Let us now recall how a bar graph is constructed by considering the following example.

{"id": "class 9__maths__p165__c1", "text": "STATISTICS 153 Solution : We draw the bar graph of this data in the following steps. Note that the unit in the second column is thousand rupees. So, ‘4’ against ‘grocery’ means `4000. 1. We represent the Heads (variable) on the horizontal axis choosing any scale, since the width of the bar is not important. But for clarity, we take equal widths for all bars and maintain equal gaps in between. Let one Head be represented by one unit. 2. We represent the expenditure (value) on the vertical axis. Since the maximum expenditure is `5000, we can choose the scale as 1 unit = `1000. 3. To represent our first Head, i.e., grocery, we draw a rectangular bar with width 1 unit and height 4 units. 4. Similarly, other Heads are represented leaving a gap of 1 unit in between two consecutive bars. The bar graph is drawn in Fig. 12.2. Fig. 12.2 Here, you can easily visualise the relative characteristics of the data at a glance, e.g., the expenditure on education is more than double that of medical expenses. Therefore, in some ways it serves as a better representation of data than the tabular form. Activity 1 : Continuing with the same four groups of Activity 1, represent the data by suitable bar graphs.

We can choose the scale as 1 cm = 5 kg. Also, since the first class interval is starting from 30.5 and not zero, we show it on the graph by marking a kink or a break on the axis. (ii) We represent the number of students (frequency) on the vertical axis on a suitable scale. Since the maximum frequency is 15, we need to choose the scale to accomodate this maximum frequency. (iii) We now draw rectangles (or rectangular bars) of width equal to the class-size and lengths according to the frequencies of the corresponding class intervals. For example, the rectangle for the class interval 30.5 - 35.5 will be of width 1 cm and length 4.5 cm. (iv) In this way, we obtain the graph as shown in Fig. 12.3: Reprint 2025-26"}

This is called a histogram, which is a graphical representation of a grouped frequency distribution with continuous classes. Also, unlike a bar graph, the width of the bar plays a significant role in its construction. Here, in fact, areas of the rectangles erected are proportional to the corresponding frequencies. However, since the widths of the rectangles are all equal, the lengths of the rectangles are proportional to the frequencies. That is why, we draw the lengths according to (iii) above. Now, consider a situation different from the one above. Example 3 : A teacher wanted to analyse the performance of two sections of students in a mathematics test of 100 marks. Looking at their performances, she found that a few students got under 20 marks and a few got 70 marks or above. So she decided to group them into intervals of varying sizes as follows: 0 - 20, 20 - 30, . . ., 60 - 70, 70 - 100. Then she formed the following table: Reprint 2025-26"}

Fig. 12.4 Carefully examine this graphical representation. Do you think that it correctly represents the data? No, the graph is giving us a misleading picture. As we have mentioned earlier, the areas of the rectangles are proportional to the frequencies in a histogram. Earlier this problem did not arise, because the widths of all the rectangles were equal. But here, since the widths of the rectangles are varying, the histogram above does not Reprint 2025-26"}

So, we need to make certain modifications in the lengths of the rectangles so that the areas are again proportional to the frequencies. The steps to be followed are as given below: 1. Select a class interval with the minimum class size. In the example above, the minimum class-size is 10. 2. The lengths of the rectangles are then modified to be proportionate to the class-size 10. For instance, when the class-size is 20, the length of the rectangle is 7. So when the class-size is 10, the length of the rectangle will be 7 20 × 10 = 3.5. Similarly, proceeding in this manner, we get the following table: Table 12.4 Marks Frequency Width of Length of the rectangle the class 0 - 20 7 20 7 20 × 10 = 3.5 20 - 30 10 10 10 10 × 10 = 10 30 - 40 10 10 10 10 × 10 = 10 40 - 50 20 10 20 10 × 10 = 20 50 - 60 20 10 20 10 × 10 = 20 60 - 70 15 10 15 10 × 10 = 15 70 - 100 8 30 8 30 × 10 = 2.67 Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 9__maths__p170__c1", "text": "158 MATHEMATICS Since we have calculated these lengths for an interval of 10 marks in each case, we may call these lengths as “proportion of students per 10 marks interval”. So, the correct histogram with varying width is given in Fig. 12.5. Fig. 12.5 (C) Frequency Polygon There is yet another visual way of representing quantitative data and its frequencies. This is a polygon. To see what we mean, consider the histogram represented by Fig. 12.3. Let us join the mid-points of the upper sides of the adjacent rectangles of this histogram by means of line segments. Let us call these mid-points B, C, D, E, F and G. When joined by line segments, we obtain the figure BCDEFG (see Fig. 12.6). To complete the polygon, we assume that there is a class interval with frequency zero Reprint 2025-26"}

Fig. 12.6 Although, there exists no class preceding the lowest class and no class succeeding the highest class, addition of the two class intervals with zero frequency enables us to make the area of the frequency polygon the same as the area of the histogram. Why is this so? (Hint : Use the properties of congruent triangles.) Now, the question arises: how do we complete the polygon when there is no class preceding the first class? Let us consider such a situation. Reprint 2025-26"}

Solution : Let us first draw a histogram for this data and mark the mid-points of the tops of the rectangles as B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, respectively. Here, the first class is 0-10. So, to find the class preceeding 0-10, we extend the horizontal axis in the negative direction and find the mid-point of the imaginary class-interval (–10) - 0. The first end point, i.e., B is joined to this mid-point with zero frequency on the negative direction of the horizontal axis. The point where this line segment meets the vertical axis is marked as A. Let L be the mid-point of the class succeeding the last class of the given data.

{"id": "class 9__maths__p173__c1", "text": "STATISTICS 161 Frequency polygons can also be drawn independently without drawing histograms. For this, we require the mid-points of the class-intervals used in the data. These mid-points of the class-intervals are called class-marks. To find the class-mark of a class interval, we find the sum of the upper limit and lower limit of a class and divide it by 2. Thus, Class-mark = Upper limit + Lower limit 2 Let us consider an example. Example 5 : In a city, the weekly observations made in a study on the cost of living index are given in the following table: Table 12.6 Cost of living index Number of weeks 140 - 150 5 150 - 160 10 160 - 170 20 170 - 180 9 180 - 190 6 190 - 200 2 Total 52 Draw a frequency polygon for the data above (without constructing a histogram). Solution : Since we want to draw a frequency polygon without a histogram, let us find the class-marks of the classes given above, that is of 140 - 150, 150 - 160,.... For 140 - 150, the upper limit = 150, and the lower limit = 140 So, the class-mark = 150 + 140 2 = 290 2 = 145. Continuing in the same manner, we find the class-marks of the other classes as well.

We should not forget to plot the point corresponding to the class-mark of the class 130 - 140 (just before the lowest class 140 - 150) with zero frequency, that is, A(135, 0), and the point H (205, 0) occurs immediately after G(195, 2).

{"id": "class 9__phe__p3__c1", "text": "Foreword Health of children is a major concern worldwide. Their health is very important as they constitute a large percentage of our population. Many factors like physical, psychological, socio-economic and cultural influence our health, both in our day-to-day life and in the long run. The involvement of all children in physical activities, games and sport, and yoga along with authentic knowledge is essential for their physical, emotional, social and mental development. In this endeavour, school education plays an important role. All the National Curriculum Frameworks have recommended health and physical education as an integral part of the school curriculum. With this view, the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has prepared this textbook on Health and Physical Education for Class X. This textbook focuses on the holistic understanding of physical education and its relationship with other subjects and the effects of physical activities on human body. It also provides a scope for children to learn the theoretical, as well as, the practical aspects of individual and team games. Further, it discusses yoga, dietary considerations, safety measures for healthy living, social health, agencies and awards promoting health, sports and yoga. The information about coronavirus (COVID-19), its modes of transmision and prevention have also been included at relevant places to help the children remain safe and healthy. Keeping in view the inter-related nature of the concepts covered in the area of Health and Physical Education, the presentation is made in a cohesive and an integrated manner rather than adopting a fragmentary approach. Experiential learning activities for acquiring skills for healthy living are made an integral part of the book. The NCERT appreciates the efforts of the Textbook Development Committee. Several experts and teachers have contributed towards the finalisation of this book. We are grateful to them and their institutions. I am thankful to Professor Saroj Yadav, Dean (Academic) and the Project Coordinator of the National Population Education Project (NPEP) for her continuous efforts in developing this material and bringing it to its present from. As an organisation committed to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality of our products, the NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions from teachers and students, which will enable us to undertake further revision and refinement.

Further the teachers will be empowered to bring out the positive change through modification during learning and practicing various games and sports among students. In schools, where infrastructural facilities are not available, the teacher may improvise them with the help of students like playground, equipments, rules of the games, etc. This will also develop creativity among children. Playing games and sports in all conditions important for holistic health. The book contains 13 chapters. The first chapter deals with Physical Education and its relationship with other subjects. The second chapter explains the effects of physical activities on human body. The third chapter discusses the issues related to growth and development during adolescence. Chapters 4, 5, 6, and 7 discuss the details of individual and team games. Efforts have been made to include latest rules and regulations of various games and sports and other related areas. Since the rules and regulations keep on changing, teachers and students may visit the official website of the recognised Federation or Association of the different games and sports. The names of some websites are given separately. The teachers and students may also see some of the videos of different games and sports given in the official websites related to a particular federation for understanding the rules and learning the skills. Yoga for Healthy Living is the eighth chapter. Chapter 9 explains dietary considerations and food quality. Safety for healthy living, healthy community living and social health are discussed in Chapters 10, 11 and 12 respectively. The last chapter provides details about the agencies and awards promoting health, sport and yoga. The book also includes information about corona virus, more specifically known as COVID-19 causing massive loss of human lives and creating panic across the world. It is important to prevent and deal with this challenge and to empower the younger generation to face this challenge. The book has provided links as well as, added the relevant information at suitable places.

The teacher should also emphasise on developing life skills, such as, understanding self, social awareness, team building, cooperation, empathy, communication skill, creative thinking and also development of values. The students can correlate the given activities in the textbook with their day-to-day life. As a teacher, you have to understand that this textbook is different from other subject textbooks in the sense that its contents need to be understood well and applied throughout life for one’s own well being and that of others. Its use should not, therefore, be solely examination driven. Even a general discussion from time to time would be useful. Activities included in it, are of practical nature and enjoyable and one can make sure that the concepts are clarified by involving students in experiential learning. Physical activities and exercises of all kinds have been given to ensure the development of fitness and questioning skills, including life skills.

In other words, it aims at optimum physical, mental and social development of an individual. What is Physical Education? According to Webster’s Dictionary, “Physical education is a part of education which gives instructions in the development and care of the body rending from simple callisthenic exercises to a course of study providing training in hygiene, gymnastics, and the performance and management of athletics and games.” Central Advisory Board of Physical Education and Recreation defines PE as “an education through physical activities for the development of total personality of the child to its fullness and perfection in body, mind and spirit. Physical education is an area through which sports, outdoor activities like trekking, hiking, camping, gymnastics, dance, aquatics are used to train individuals in motor skills and fitness skills. Physical education also assists the schools in carrying out responsibility of developing personal and social skills in students.” In fact, PE is an integral part of total education. It makes significant contribution towards the achievement of desirable educational and health outcomes. It also enables children to acquire necessary knowledge and skills to stimulate them to actively participate in physical activities throughout their lifespan. Need and Importance of Physical Education Participation in games, sports and yoga provide thrill and enjoyment to everyone. In addition, it helps to entertain and maintain a healthy lifestyle.

Academic achievement By participating in various physical and yogic activities, students get stimulated to face challenges and are encouraged to think productively. This tends to improve their concentration of academic achievement. Develops skills and experiences Various activities learned during school days such as gymnastics, running, jumping, throwing, swimming, playing team games, learning the rules and regulations of the games and being disciplined help students to develop sportspersonship. Positive self-image Participation in regular physical activities also helps students to understand the need for appreciation of own positive aspects and develop ability to compete and cooperate with others. Self belief is also reinforced. Improves interpersonal relationships When you play with other students and teams, you learn to develop interpersonal relationships with members of your own team as well as with members of other teams. It builds interactive and positive social environment. Develops internal organ systems By participating in physical and yogic activities, students respond to the increased demands of daily life in a healthy way. The system of the body responds to stimuli and becomes more efficient at coping with the load exerted on it. Objectives of Physical Education Broadly, there are four objectives of Physical Education which are as follows. Physical fitness It refers to the state where an individual is physically fit and has developed great endurance, speed and strength. Physical fitness is essential for leading a happy, healthy, vigorous and fulfilling life. Physical and motor fitness helps to learn and develop technical and tactical knowledge of sports and games. Activity 1.1 • • Measure your pulse and respiration rates before and after playing different games or participation in a sport event. •• Collect information from 10 persons and prepare a project on physical activities and eating habits and their impact on the human body.

Physical education activities provide ample opportunities to develop such traits and life skills as cooperation, respect for others, loyalty, sportspersonship, self-confidence, etc. All these qualities help a person to become more social and a responsible citizen. Sports culture It aims at developing an understanding and appreciation of one’s own local environment as well as the global environment. By participating in various physical activities, such as, dance, sports, games and yoga, a person fully understands the history, culture, traditions, etc., and also the aesthetic values associated with these activities. Mental efficiency In physical education, a child has to participate in a number of physical and yogic activities. These activities not only require involvement of the body but also require use of the intellect to carry out the task. Positive, healthy and active body-mind relationship helps to enhance mental efficiency. Scope of Physical Education Physical education has evolved as a multi-disciplinary subject and its scope is not just confined to physical fitness and the rules of games and sports. The meaning and definition of Physical Education, its aims and objectives and scope, and factors affecting physical fitness and wellness, rules and other necessary knowledge about health, games and sports and yoga are major areas of study in physical education. Games and sports, as well as, cultural heritage, development of leadership qualities and group dynamics through sports and games are also an integral part of this discipline. In fact, physical education now includes several areas which belong to other subjects like Biology, Genetics, Psychology, Physics, Bio Chemistry, Sociology, Anthropology, History, Culture, Medicine, Media studies, etc. Contents from other disciplines like laws of motion, types of lever, force, equilibrium and centre of gravity, common postural deviations, therapeutic modalities in rehabilitation, sports massage, prevention and first aid for common sport- injuries, are also the content of physical education. Biological foundations such as heredity and environment, growth and development are also included in it. Content drawn from psychology, such as, importance of psychology in education with special reference to physical education, such as, individual differences and personality, learning and motivation are related to Physical Education.

What is Coronavirus? Covid 19 is the infectious disease caused by the recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. That is why it is called the Novel (new) Coronavirus (NCoV). 2. What are the symptoms? The most common symptoms of Coronavirus are fever, cough and difficulty in breathing. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and dont’t feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. People with fever cough and difficulty in breathing should seek medical attention immediately. 3. How does Coronavirus spread? People can catch Coronavirus from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with Coronavirus coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch Coronavirus by first touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch Coronavirus if they breathe in from a person with Coronavirus who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter away from a person who is sick. 4. How to prevent Coronavirus? Wash your hands with soap water regularly. Throw used tissues into closed bins immediately after use. If soap and water is not available, use hand sanitiser with at least 60 per cent alcohol. Cover your nose and mouth with handkerchief/tissue while sneezing and coughing. Wash hands before touching eyes, nose and mouth. Avoid mass gathering and crowded places.

These are principles and characteristics of sports training, methods of sports training, training load, warming up, cooling down, aerobic and anaerobic activities, calisthenics and rhythmic exercises, specific training program for development of various motor qualities, techniques, tactics and talent identification. It is also important to understand the difference between play, games and sports. Play, Games and Sport Though these terms are used interchangeably, these are actually different. Play Play is spontaneous. It is usually a creative activity but has its own limitation and space. One plays voluntarily for fun and pleasure. Play, however, is a broad area which includes both games and sports. The distinctive features of play are that they are free, separate, uncertain, governed by self rules and creative. Games Generally the word games and sports are used together. A game is an activity involving more players, defined by a goal that the players tries to reach, and some set rules to play. By masses, games are played primarily for entertainment or enjoyment. The difference of purpose differentiates sport from game, combined with the notion of individual or team skill. Games are also played on the basis of a set of rules. A game is defined as a goal that the players try to achieve. A person who participates in a game is known as a player. Sport A sport is a physical activity carried out under an agreed set of rules, for competition or self-enjoyment or a combination of these. Sport are the kind of activities in which similar kind of body movement is repeated over a long time. For example, swimming and running and almost all the track and field events come under sport. Sport involves an activity or activities where the mental capabilities of the sportsperson are judged. In a sport, it is the sportsperson or the individual who determines the outcome. A person participating in a sport is called an athlete or a sportsperson. Activity 1.3 The teacher divides students into small groups of 10 and plans an aerobic dance or drama.

These ideas might then be used by students in various other fields of learning, such as, arts, science, civics and citizenship, communication, design, creativity and technology and languages (english, hindi and other regional languages), humanities (e.g. history, geography, economics, etc.), information and communication technology and psychology. Art Health and physical education teachers can incorporate activities related to performing arts, drawing, painting, dance, drama, media, music and visual communication into their programs. These involve both fine motor skills and whole body movement including rhythmic movement. As body movements are part of both arts practice and health and physical education, these promote health knowledge, understanding of the body and lead to physical fitness and enhancing of creative skills at the same time. Science The human body is a common concern of both science and health and physical education. In science, students study the human body from the cellular level to the systems level, with a focus on anatomy and physiology. In health and physical education learning is focused on the requirements for good health and the promotion of a healthy body. Students gain an understanding of the role of physical and yogic activities in ensuring good health and can link the functioning of the musculo-skeletal, digestive, endocrine and nervous systems studied in science, for the promotion of the physical, social, mental and emotional health of individuals within a society. Students consider it their personal responsibilities to discuss and adopt health issues, both in relation to their own safety and well-being, as well as to the safety and well-being of others.

Key concepts within health and physical education classes include understanding of the importance of personal identity within a community, what makes a community and how to engage with different members and agencies within a community. Participation in physical activity and sports also reflect values, rules, rights and responsibilities indicative of a democratic society. Communication Communication involves developing knowledge, skills and behaviors that empower students to respond to, make meaning of, and deconstruct a range of communication forms. Effective communication is a key skill in health and physical education. It is essential that students develop the ability to listen, view and respond with respect to the content and context in which communication happens. Learning in the health and physical education domain involves developing familiarity with forms, language and conventions used in different forms of public, personal and interpersonal communication. Design, Creativity and Technology Design, Creativity and Technology (DCT) help in developing sport goods, sportwear, sport software programme, etc. These are associated with knowledge and promotion. In this area students learn about the characteristic and properties of how all these aspects differ from each other. These investigations assist students to make decisions about appropriate solution. Students analyse and evaluate factors, such as, social, cultural and economic factors that influence design, creativity and technology. Language(s) Languages help students to develop critical approaches to the ideas and thoughts collated to read, view, write, compare, research and talk about texts. Health and Physical Education teachers can use examples related to health and wellbeing to encourage students to reflect on their lifestyles and analyse ways by which the media influences their attitude towards health. For example, Health and Physical Education emphasises on the importance of physical fitness, self-esteem and body image in the maintenance of good health. Economics Economics is the study of how society allocates scarce resources to satisfy the wants and needs of its members.

The concepts of movement, dance, physical activity and sport, vary culturally. These are associated with their own specific languages, vocabularies and discourses. Different societies have different attitudes, values and beliefs about physical activities which are expressed in their regional languages. Myths and Misconceptions about Physical Education Myths are surrounded in regard to relationship of physical education with academic success. One of the most discussed myths in the society is that participation in sport and games reduces academic performance of individual. Myths Participation in sport kills the time of study. Contrary to the widely held assumption that sport and other activities cut upon the time for serious school study, research evidence has shown that students tend to do better in school when they participate in physical activities. There is a positive correlation between performance in sport and the level of academic achievement. Physical education including sport is an integral part of the social and cultural infrastructure of a nation. It really can make a difference in the broader educational process and in changing and enhancing the quality of life. Vigorous physical exercise stimulates circulation, helps prevent skin eruptions and increases fluid intake. These exercises also promote self-worth and mental health, and support an individual for healing an injury. Sport also enhances physical performance and induce positive physiological adaptation. When children exercise, their fitness needs are met, and build up energy to learn and achieve. Given the growing number of children with obesity, watching TV, continuously being involved in computer games and other unwanted activities, frequency of the children getting involved in physical achievement and academic performance, has taken a back seat. Physical exercise enhances the function in joints, increases the sense of physical well being and promotes a sense of feeling good.

You are aware that a healthy individual is one who has a healthy mind in a healthy body. This state of health can be achieved when various organ systems of the body function in harmony. For example, physical activities are based on motor movements and their co-ordination. The command for movements comes from the brain which is a part of the nervous system. The required energy for movements and other activities is obtained from food. Food is completely digested in the intestine, a part of digestive system. Food and oxygen reach all the parts of body through the action of heart, which is a part of the circulatory system. In fact, many organ systems of the body function as an integrated whole for healthy maintenance of the body. You have already studied about organ systems of the human body in the previous science classes. In this chapter, the organ systems have been discussed in relation to the effect of physical activities. It is a common experience that performance in any event, sports or otherwise, depends upon physical health, as well as, mental and emotional health. Development and maintenance of physical, mental and emotional health specially during this coronavirus (COVID-19) is therefore, very important. Organ Systems of Human Body Aggregates of cells constitute a tissue. Tissues of various kinds together make an organ and many organs together comprise an organ system.

Organ systems for movement of body and limbs: skeletal and muscular systems When you walk, play, exercise, practice or participate in a sport, or even when you ‘warm up’ prior to a sport activity or competition, what is most obvious are the movements of hands and legs, with the brain being equally active. All the movements are due to contraction of muscles. Muscles are attached to bones. Bones form the skeleton. Bones are attached to each other by ligaments and muscles are attached to bones by tendons (Fig. 2.1, 2.2, 2.3).

You have learnt in earlier classes that there are mainly three kinds of muscles. There are muscles that contract to cause movements according to one’s will. These are called voluntary muscles, such as, those of the limbs and the neck. The involuntary muscles, such as, those lining the food canal, move automatically without our efforts for making them move. Another kind of muscles, which are also involuntary, are the muscles of the heart or cardiac muscles which never stop contracting and relaxing. As learnt in earlier classes, muscle cells (muscle fibres) may be striated (voluntary) muscle fibres, unstriated (involuntary) muscle fibres and cardiac muscle fibres (Fig.2.4). Muscles are grouped into bundles enclosed in a membrane. Movement of muscles takes place by the movement of molecules of muscle proteins, called actin and myosin present in the muscle fibres. Upon receiving instructions from the brain and nerves, these proteins slide over each other and the muscle contracts. Muscle contraction uses up energy, which comes from food. It is measured in calories. Energy producing organ systems Through digestive system, food gets digested and converted to a form, which can be broken down in the cell to release energy. Respiratory system ensures a continuous supply of Oxygen to each and every cell of the body for oxidation of food. It is also responsible for continuous elimination of carbon dioxide produced as a result of this oxidation. Digested food (Glucose) + Oxygen → Carbon dioxide + Water + ATP Adenosine Tri Phosphate (ATP) is the chemical that releases energy. ATP is biological energy. Respiratory system functions to ensure the continuous supply of oxygen to the body and removal of carbon dioxide from the body. Fig. 2.5 shows the different parts of the respiratory system. The intake of oxygen laden air from the atmosphere into lungs is inspiration (inhalation) and the process of removal of CO2 laden air from lungs is expiration (exhalation). Inspiration and expiration constitute breathing. (Fig. 2.7) Activity 2.1 Underline the labelled vital organs in Fig. 2.5 Observe the location of the vital organs such as the spinal cord.

It passes through nostrils, pharynx, trachea and bronchi and reaches the lungs (inhalation). The reverse happens during exhalation when muscles of the rib cage and diaphragm relax and CO2 laden air from lungs goes out through bronchi, trachea and nostrils. Breathing is followed by internal respiration when oxygen laden air from alveoli or air sacks of lungs is picked up by capillaries and reaches the heart through pulmonary vein. Once oxygen reaches cells, it oxidises glucose (which reaches cells after digestion through blood) to release energy as ATP or adenosine tri phosphate.

Organs of the circulatory system Heart Blood Vessels Arteries Veins Capillaries Heart (Fig. 2.8) is the most vital organ of the body. It is situated between the two lungs in the thoracic cavity and is a cone shaped muscular, four chambered organ covered by a membrane. The four chambers are left and right atria (singular atrium) and left and right ventricles. They are separated by muscular partitions called septa singular septum. The chambers communicate by openings which are protected by valves. The cardiac muscle cells continuously contract and relax (heart beat) for pumping blood into the organs and receiving blood from them. As the heart beats, oxygenated blood flows into the arteries and goes to various parts of the body, and then it flows back to the heart through veins for oxygenation in the lungs. This circulation of blood is depicted below. Blood flow between heart and lungs is called pulmonary circulation, while between heart and body parts is called systemic circulation.

Strong muscles also give stability and improve balance and coordination during movements. Physical activities also improve blood supply to the muscles and increase their capacity to use oxygen. Muscles and muscle performance Physical activities if undertaken regularly have beneficial effects on the muscular system. Whenever physical activities, games or sport are undertaken there is contraction of muscles and increase in energy level due to breakdown of ATP. The beneficial effects of regular physical activities are listed below — •• Change in shape and size of the muscle fibres: Muscle fibres enlarge with physical activities which cause an overall enlargement of muscles with the change in its size and shape. The size of muscles increases by 60 per cent. It is because of this reason that, the muscles of arms of a tennis player are well developed. •• Maintenance of muscle tone: Muscles are stimulated to contract by signals from nerves. Due to continuous signals, when physical exercises are undertaken, muscles remain in partial state of contraction called muscle tone. Hence, regular physical activities maintain good muscle tone and enhance physical fitness. •• Increase in muscle proteins: The units of muscle contraction are proteins. Physical activities lead to increase in total proteins. •• Increase in blood capillaries: Regular physical exercises lead to increase in number of blood capillaries supplying blood to muscles. •• Increase in efficiency of ligaments and tendons: Ligaments and tendons become more efficient as a result of regular physical activity. This improves muscle movements resulting in greater tolerance of stress during strenuous activity. •• Long term increase in muscle strength: Regular physical exercises increase and maintain strength of muscles. This increases speed of contraction as in the case of marathon runner and also work well against load as in the case of weight lifter. •• Delay in muscle fatigue: Muscles need oxygen to contract. But when muscles are used for a long time during sport, available oxygen gets used up and lactic acid accumulates. This causes muscle fatigue. It is, therefore, important to do physical activities like stretching to delay muscle fatigue. Reprint 2025-26"}

Healthy muscles give the body a beautiful shape. Oxygen Debt During physical activities, respiratory rate increases. At the same time, oxygen gets speedily used up, this creates an oxygen debt, as the rate of oxygen intake may not match the oxygen requirement due to the exercise. Thus, maximum exercises are followed by a recovery period when oxygen debt is removed by obtaining more oxygen. For example, when an athlete is running and requires 3 litres of oxygen, if oxygen obtained is only 2 litres, oxygen debt of 1 litre is created, which gets recovered during recovery period. •• Overall improvement in efficiency of muscle movements and reaction time: Muscles contract on receiving stimulus from nerves. The time taken to react to the stimuli (reaction time) improves with regular physical exercise. •• Increase in capacity for storage of food: Regular physical activities help cells to store more food, which can be readily available for oxidation to provide energy when needed. Respiratory system •• Increase in size of lungs and volume of chest: Physical activities require more oxygen. Therefore, more oxygen has to be inhaled. This provides exercise to the lungs and chest and as a result the size increases. Simultaneously, the diaphragm and rib muscles strengthen. •• Increase in lung power: Respiratory exercises, which include Pranayam and Anulom-vilom, improve lung power. The efficiency of alveoli or air sacs of lungs also improves. •• Activation of unused (inactive) alveoli: Active inhalation increases residual volume of air, tidal air and vital capacity which is important for healthy body. Residual volume of air: Even after forced expiration some air remains in the lung, it cannot be expelled and is called residual air. Vital capacity: Vital capacity is the amount of air inhaled and exhaled with maximum effort. In normal adult, it is 3500 cc to 4500 cc. Vital Capacity = TV + IRV + ERV (TV= Tidal Volume, IRV =Inspiratory Reserve Volume, ERV=Expiratory Reserve Volume) TV: The volume of air breathed in and out during quiet breathing is called tidal volume.

Circulatory system Blood pumped into circulation transports oxygen and food to tissues, removes waste and also transports hormones to target organs. During physical activities, nutrients and Oxygen is needed by muscles to get energy for contraction. So heart pumps at a faster rate and circulation is speeded up. But this change is temporary. Certain permanent changes also occur when physical activities are undertaken regularly. These are given below. •• Increase in the size of heart occurs as cardiac muscles develop with regular physical activities. Regular exercise increases the capacity and thickness of the walls of the heart. •• Increase in number of capillaries and blood cells: The unused capillaries become active with physical activities making circulation efficient. An increase in the number of blood cells and amount of hemoglobin has also been observed. •• Decrease in heart rate: Under normal conditions the heart beats 72 times per minute at rest. But an athlete’s heart rate may be found to be much lower at rest. The athlete’s heart becomes so efficient that at rest same requirement is fulfilled with fewer heartbeats. •• Increase in stroke volume: Stroke volume is the quantity of blood pumped out by aorta in one stroke. Heart, having gained efficiency with regular physical activities, is able to pump out more blood in one stroke.

The period of growth and development from childhood to adulthood is a period full of joy and challenges is known as ‘adolescence’.

Note: Adolescence is a crucial period in the life cycle of human beings. Understanding Adolescence The period of adolescence begins with the onset of puberty, during which certain hormones gets activated. It is an increase in secretion of sex hormones (testosterone in males, estrogen and progesterone in females). Puberty merges into adolescence at around 10 years of age, and adolescence generally lasts till 19 years of age. You may recall the discussion on adolescence in the chapters of your Class VIII textbook of science and the Class IX textbook of Health and Physical Education. During this phase, significant physical and psychological changes take place. However, as you have already learnt in your previous classes, the timing of these changes varies with every individual. Unique features of adolescence The two unique features of adolescence are — (i) The spurt in physical growth, when a physical appearance of an individual gradually becomes different. This is due to the rapid acceleration in growth of skeletal tissue (bones and cartilage) and muscular and glandular tissue. For examples, breasts begin to develop in girls due to the release of estrogen hormone. Changes in voice are quite noticeable among boys. (ii) It is a time period between the onset of puberty and adulthood. Growth spurt in adolescents As you would have experienced yourself, the changes during adolescence occur speedily and alter the body size and shape of adolescents. Suddenly the child seems to have grown up into a young adult. This is called growth spurt and is shown through the following flow chart. Reprint 2025-26"}

Sex hormones stimulate growth and maturity of gonads (reproductive organs). In males, testes grow in size and start producing sperms. In females, the eggs or ova present in the ovary since birth begins to mature. Sex organs also increase in size. Thus, there is an overall growth in body size. As sexual maturity progresses during adolescence, hormones act on growth centers of bones which are responsible for increase in length of bones. The long bones, the vertebrae and limbs grow and the adolescent gains height. The limbs become stronger. The heart, lungs and other internal organs also grow to match the increase in body size. The muscle mass undergoes a spurt at adolescence. Eventually, growth rate slows down and then stops. Generally, at the age of 14 to 18 years of age, adult height is already reached. The peak of growth of muscle mass is also typically around the age of 14 to 16 years. In the females, the pelvis region undergoes a growth spurt and becomes wider. Secondary Sexual Characteristics In earlier classes, you have learnt about secondary sexual characteristics. As a result of physical changes, secondary sexual characteristics begin to develop in both girls and boys. Some characteristics are related to girls; some to boys and some are common for both. You may understand this development better by conducting Activity 3.1. Activity 3.1 Identify the secondary sexual characteristics of adolescence during 10 to 19 years in the given table.

Sweat and oil glands become active Wet Dreams Wet dreams are a normal and natural physiological process which starts during adolescence among boys. It usually occurs during sleep. Wet dreams is a discharge of semen (seminal fluid) containing sperms. Many adolescent boys are usually not aware of this phenomenon and get worried when they face this situation first time. Semen is the fluid formed by glands associated with male reproductive system. Semen carries mature sperms formed in the testes. Read the following case studies which confirm the uniqueness of every individual with regard to time of occurrence of changes during adolescence. CASE 1: My father calls me ‘Sher’ Rakesh and Dibang, students of Class IX, are walking home together from school. Rakesh begins to tease Dibang, saying that he speaks in a girl’s voice. He also laughs at the fact that Dibang has got no hair on his upper lip. “Look at me,” Rakesh says, “I am a real man. My voice is strong and my face is manly - I have so much facial hair.

In India, age of menarche is 12-13 years but may vary from individual to individual. Menstruation generally stops between the age of 45 and 55 years and is termed as menopause. Menopausal age varies in different individuals. Age of menarche has decreased due to various lifestyle changes. Menstruation hygiene and cleanliness is very important. Points to remember — •• Regular bath and washing self properly are important for avoiding infections, especially during menstruation. •• Change undergarment regularly (at least once a day) and avoid synthetic cloth. •• During menstruation, cloth, cloth pads or napkins should be changed after every four to six hours to avoid infection. •• One can also use sanitary napkins to manage menstrual hygiene. Many girls and women also make sanitary napkins at home with old cloth and cotton. If one makes a sanitary napkin at home, use only clean, soft cotton cloth. Do not use old cloth that may have any metal or plastic parts in it like glitter, gota or hooks and buttons.

Government is supporting schemes for promoting menstrual hygiene among adolescent girls (10-19 years). Sanitary napkins are made available in schools or by ASHAs at a subsidised rate. Psychosocial Changes during Adolescence Psychosocial changes mean changes in thoughts, mood, attractions and friendships. The word ‘social’ is associated with the word ‘society’. As adolescence sets in, a boy or girl becomes psychologically aware of self and society. As a result, the adolescents build their own image and personality. This gives confidence to the adolescent to move in the society. Adolescence is a transitional phase between childhood and adulthood. During this transitional period the adolescents get confused regarding their emerging role in the family and society at large. The physical changes in adolescents are accompanied by psychosocial changes. Adolescents get attracted towards opposite sex or become part of a peer group. Such changes tend to make them more dependent on the peer group in neighborhood, among classmates, etc. This often creates stressful relationships with parents, teachers and elders. Sometimes these developments may make them insecure about future. Adolescents who become aware of these changes, overcome this phase comfortably. The social changes are reflected in the behavior of adolescents with peers and parents. They differ from parents on many issues and develop the confidence to express their own opinion emphatically if parents are friendly and understanding. Adolescents are more friendly with their peer group. However belonging to a vulnerable age group, adolescents may feel pressurised under the influence of peers. Everyone feels the need to have friends but during adolescence the need for friendship is more pronounced. The friendship may be with a peer or relative of one’s own age and someone of own sex or the other sex. It is, therefore, important for them to identify with whom they can share their ideas and identify ‘safety net’ in friends, parents and teachers.

While you must maintain hygiene of all external parts, the internal organs also have to function normally. You know that certain vital functions of the body for enjoying good health are maintenance of blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, etc. Some ways of assessing the vital functions and statistics of human beings are given below. Blood pressure (BP) and its measurement Pressure exerted by blood on the wall of the arteries is called blood pressure. When the heart contracts, blood surges through aorta, BP is highest (Systolic Pressure) pressure of blood on the arterial wall recorded when ventricles relax is lowest (Diastolic Pressure). The pressure wave along the arteries with each heartbeat can be felt at the pulse. Blood pressure is measured by the instrument called “Sphygmoma- nometer”. Diastolic and Systolic pressure is measured and in a normal healthy young adult it is 110/75, which means 110 mm Hg systolic and 75 mm Hg diastolic. Sphygmomanometer consists of cuff with an inflatable bladder which is wrapped around a person’s up- per arm and a rubber bulb inflates the bladder. An attached device indicates the blood pressure. There is now a digital de- vice which is also used for measuring the BP. BP increases with age to about 130/90mm Hg. Abnormally high BP is called hypertension.

Examination of conjunction The conjunction is a transparent membrane over the eye. A smooth shiny moist conjunction is normal. If red or thick or covered by a secretion or foreign body, it requires immediate medical attention or consultation of a eye doctor. Tongue examination Nutritional deficiencies, infections, dysfunction of nerves or even cancer can be detected by examining the tongue. Some key characteristic features of a tongue in normal condition can be noted by physical examination. These are — (i) Colour: Pink red on both upper and lower surface. On lower surface blood vessels may be seen. (ii) Texture: Rough on upper surface due to presence of papillae or taste buds. Hair, farrows or ulceration indicates dysfunction. (iii) Size: If not swollen, tongue will fit comfortably inside the mouth. The tongue can be examined by the following steps — • Make tip of tongue touch roof of mouth to inspect ventral surface. • When protruded out, colour and texture can be noted for any deviation. • Use gauze to hold protruded tongue (wearing gloves) between tongue and index figure and fill the fender areas.

The first recorded example of organised track and field events is found in the Ancient Olympic Games held in 776 BC. The starting of the modern Olympic Games at Greece in 1896 was marked as new era for track and field events which was initiated by Pierre-de-Coubertin. Until the early 1920s, only males were participating in the track and field events. Introduction of five track and field events for women in the athletics was started during 1928 Summer Olympics. Gradually more women’s events were introduced as time progressed. However, it was only towards the second half of the twentieth century that the men’s and women’s track and field events were given equal status. Furthermore, major track and field events for disabled athletes were first introduced at the 1960 Summer Para Olympics. From 1990’s onwards, track and field events became increasingly more professional.

These include track events covering distances of 100 meters, 200 meters, 400 meters, 4×100 meters relay, 4×400 meters relay, and hurdle races of 100 meters for women, 110 meters for men and 400 meters for both men and women. At the professional level, sprinters begin the race by assuming a crouching position on the starting blocks. Then they lean their body forward and gradually move into an upright position as the race progresses and momentum is gained. Athlete remain in the same lane on the running track throughout the sprinting distance. The man or woman who runs fastest and takes minimum time over 100m, wins the race. The winner is often named ‘the fastest man/woman in the competition’. Some sprint events start in lanes, to cover the same distance for each runner. Middle distance Fig. 4.4: Middle distance running The middle distance races are of 800 meters and 1500 meters. Runners start the race from a standing start position in the lanes along a curved starting line or in staggered lanes. However the distance is same for each runner. After hearing the starter’s pistol, they head forward in the designated lane or move towards the innermost track to follow the shortest route to the finish.

These races require that the athletes maintain a plateau pace, (i.e. the maintenance of speed at which the runner is running) that allows for a final spurt of speed, whereas sprint races need to be run at top speed for the entire length of the race. Long distance There are four common long distance running events in track and field. These are 3000 meters, 5000 meters and 10,000 meters and 3000 meters steeplechase. Long distance track races have much in common with middle distance races. However, in these races, pacing, endurance, and race tactics play an important role in performance. In these events, runners need to balance their energy to win the race. Fig. 4.5: Long distance running Relays Relay races are the only track events in which a team of runners directly compete against other teams. Common relay races are the 4×100 meter and the 4×400 meter. The exchange of baton takes place within a specified area of the track called baton exchange zone. Teams may be disqualified if the team fails to complete the baton exchange within an area of 20 meters, the team is considered as disqualified. A team may also be disqualified if its runners have deliberately created hurdle for the other competitors. The 4×100 meter event is run strictly within the same lane on the track. It means that the team collectively runs one complete circuit of the track. Teams in a 4×400 meter event remain in Fig. 4.6: Relay race Activity 4.5 What are important points in relays?

Key rules of track events relate to three phases — starting, running and finishing. Starting •• The start of a race is marked 5 cm wide by a white line. In all races, that are not run in lanes, the start line must be curved, so that all the athletes run the same distance upto the finish. •• Starting blocks shall be used for all races up to and including 400 meter (including the first lap of the 4x100 and 4x400) and shall not be used for any other race. No part of the starting block overlaps the start line or extend into another lane.

{"id": "class 9__phe__p55__c1", "text": "Individual Games and Sports I 43 Field Events Field events constitute of events that are participated by men and women outside the track. These include jumping events (Long Jump, Triple Jump, High Jump and Pole Vault) and throwing events (Shot Put, Discus Throw, Javelin Throw and Hammer Throw). Jumping events The jumping events comprise Long Jump, Triple Jump, High Jump and Pole Vault. 1. Long jump: The long jump is one of the oldest field events. The take-off has to be made from a 20 cm wide board one meter away from a pit. Athletes sprint along a length of track to a take off board and a sandpit. If any part of the runner’s foot goes past the takeoff board, the jumper is considered for a foul and does not receive score for that round. Distance is measured from the end of the takeoff board to the nearest mark made by the jumper on the pit. Best eight competitors have a maximum of six rounds. Professional long jumpers typically have strong acceleration and sprinting abilities. However, athletes must also have a consistent stride to allow them to take off near the board while still maintaining their maximum speed. Fig. 4.11: Long jump 2. Triple jump: Similar to the long jump, the triple jump takes place on a field heading towards a sandpit. This event is termed as the “hop-step and jump.” The event begins like a long jump, with competitor dashing down the runway and leaping from a takeoff board they first hop then take a step and then jump into the pit. The event is scored identically to the long jump. Reprint 2025-26"}

High jump: In high jump event, competitors combined speed, to generate lift, with jumping technique. Jumpers may approach the bar from either-side, and land on a large, generally inflated cushion. In between, they must clear the 4-meter-long bar without knocking it off its supports. The bar will originally be set at a low height, at which competitors may choose to jump, or pass to another height. The bar is raised to a predetermined height after each round. Each competitor who either clears or passes a height advances to the next round. They are ranked according to the height they clear. An athlete is allowed a maximum of three trials of each height. Competitors are eliminated after missing (failing) three consecutive jumps in a particular height. Athletes have a short run up and then take off from near one foot to jump over a horizontal bar and fall back onto a cushioned landing area. Jumping technique has played a significant part in the history of the event. The modern technique of high jump as shown in the figure is known as “Fosbury Flop”. Fig. 4.13: High jump 4.

As per technique, they begin clearing the bar with their feet first in a position so that the stomach faces the bar. As with high jumping, vaulters may touch the bar, as long as it doesn’t fall. Round-by-round scoring rules are the same as for the high jump. Throwing events There are four major throwing events: Shot Put (putting the shot), Discus, Javelin and Hammer Throw. These are detailed below. Fig. 4.15: Shot Put 1. Shot Put: In putting the shot event the athletes put a metal ball through the air for maximum distance. For male athletes, the metal ball weights 7.26 kg and for female athletes the weight is 4 kg. The athlete must stay in a circle of 2.135 m (7 ft) diameter until the shot has landed after throw.

Discus: In the discus event the athlete stands inside a throwing circle of 2.5 mt (8’–2½”) diameter. As per technique he/she turns around one and a half times and throws the disc as far as he or she can. The disc is a round plate made of wood and metal and weighs 2 Kg for men and 1 Kg for women. When throwing the discus, the athlete must remain in circle. The feet of the athlete cannot leave this area before the discus lands. Even afterwards the athlete must leave the circle from rear half of the circle. Otherwise it is a fault and the throw will not be counted. The athlete will spin around to gain momentum, speed and then releases the disc in the proper direction. The athlete that throws it furthest from the front part of the circle (and within the legal area) wins the event. Fig. 4.16: Discus throw Fig. 4.17: Javelin throw 3. Javelin: The javelin is something like a spear. The official javelin size for women is 2.2 to 2.3 meters long and weights 600 grams.

The athlete has to hold the javelin by its grip, throw the javelin overhand and cannot turn the back to the target when throwing. When throwing the javelin, the athlete runs down a runway to gain momentum and then must throw the javelin prior to crossing a line. The athlete cannot go over the line until the javelin lands. To avoid foul, the athlete must have a really good balance at the end of the throw. The athlete must leave the runway from behind the extended lines of the throwing arc. Fig. 4.18: Hammer throw 4. Hammer Throw: The hammer throw doesn’t actually involve throwing a hammer like you would think. In this throwing event the athletes throw a heavy ball (7.265 Kg for men and 4 Kg for women) that is attached to a handle with a long (4 feet) wire. Like the discus and the shot put, the athlete must stay in a circle until the hammer lands. They spin several times to gain momentum prior to releasing the hammer. Balance is important due to the force generated by having the heavy ball at the end of the long wire. Rules for field events In general, most field events allow an athlete to take their attempt individually, under the same conditions as the other athletes. Each attempt is measured to determine who achieved the longest distance or maximum height. •• Horizontal jumps (long jump and triple jump) must be initiated from behind a line. In the case of throws, that line is an arc or inside a circle. Crossing the line while initiating the attempt will invalidate the attempt. It will be considered as a foul. Reprint 2025-26"}

However, that would not improve their position in the standings. •• After all competitors have cleared, passed or failed their attempts at a height, the bar height will be raised. •• The height of the bar raised is predetermined before the competition. Though when one competitor remains, that competitor may choose their own selected height for the remaining attempts. A record is kept of each attempt by each competitor. •• After all competitors have taken their attempts, the one who jumps the highest height is the winner. The bar does not shift to a lower height except to break a tie for first place or a qualifying position. If those critical positions are still tied after applying the tiebreakers, all tied competitors will take a fourth jump at the last height. •• If they still miss, the bar will go down one increment where they will again jump.

However there are other individual sports like Badminton, Gymnastics, Table Tennis, Tennis, Swimming and Combative Sports such as Judo and Boxing. We shall discuss these games in this chapter. Badminton Badminton is a racket sport played by either two opposing players (singles) or two opposing pairs (doubles). The players take positions on opposite halves of a rectangular court that is divided by a net. It is one of the few sports where men and women can play together. It is a game for all ages and abilities. Although fitness is a key aspect for professional players, it is also played as a recreation game across the world. History The origin of the badminton dates back to second century BC. Although it appears that this sport was named after Badminton House, Gloucestershire, owned by the Duke of Beaufort. In 1873, some British army officers in India initially played the game at ‘Poonah’ (now known as Pune) thus derived its name. In 1877 first set of rules were derived. These laws were gradually adopted by other nations. However, the game evolved as an international sport only after the first All England Championship. In 1934, the International Badminton Federation (now known as Badminton World Federation) was formed and the rules of the game were standardized. Badminton Association of India came into existence in the year 1934. Various state level associations are affiliated to it. Individual Games and Sports II 5 Reprint 2025-26"}

Fundamental techniques 1. Grip: Holding grip of a badminton racket is the foundation of playing this game. Holding the racket wrongly will reduce the power and accuracy of the stroke. The shots will be limited. A player needs to learn how to change grip quickly during games. Below are the two basic types of badminton grips. Forehand grip •• This grip is used to hit shots on the forehand side of the body and around the head shots. •• In this a player holds the racket head in the non-playing hand, keeping the handle points towards the body. The face of the racket perpendicular to the floor. •• The player places the playing hand on the handle just like shaking hands with it, it is like a V shape in between thumb and index finger. •• For flexibility, the racket handle rest loosely in the fingers. •• In order to increase control and accuracy while serving and hitting from the forecourt and mid court, the grip is shortened and placed nearer to the shaft.

Angle 1 Angle 3 Angle 2 Fig. 5.3: Backhand grip 2. Service: There are basically three types of serves — high, low and flat. High service is the most basic of all strokes. One needs to learn this first when one starts playing the game. You need to concentrate on the following three broad points while delivering the high service. •• Stance: To deliver the high service, the player has to take a position about two feet from the short service line and about six inches from the centre line. The player has to make sure not to touch the centre line as it will be called a touch fault. The player has to stand comfortably with both feet spread apart and parallel to each other and take the initial serving position. At this stage, the full weight of the body is on the back foot. •• Point of Contact: As one starts the forward movement of the racket, slowly start shifting the weight from the back foot to the front foot.

The player must make sure that the point of contact is always below the waist. •• Follow-through: Once the service is delivered, the player continues to swing the racket right across the left shoulder (or right shoulder if the player is left-handed). This is called the follow through. 3. Return of Service: This stroke plays a crucial part in a rally because good return of serve allows a player to dictate terms and control a rally till the point is won. However weak return of serve will allow the opponent to go on the offensive. While receiving the serve to hit the shuttle, normally players stand in the centre of the court with the left foot forward and place the weight of the body more on the front foot. It will help the player to receive all types of serves i.e. high, low and flick. In fact, players are advised to take the stance closer to the short service because in high serve the shuttle remains in the air for a longer duration. On a high serve, a player has the choice of playing an attacking clear, drop shot, smash or a half smash. Similarly, on a low serve, a player can flick, push or lift the shuttle to the baseline. It is important to try to meet the shuttle as close to the net as possible so that the receiver has more options available to choose the shots. Gymnastics Gymnastics is a sport that involves physical movements in a sequence. It requires physical strength, balance, coordination, endurance, flexibility and body control. It often involves dance moves, flips, twists, jumps and other moves. It helps children to develop physical coordination and motor skills, proper use of balance develop a good sense of precision and timing. It can be performed as a way to stay fit or specifically to compete in events locally, nationally as well as internationally. History Gymnastics was developed for fitness and beauty practices by the ancient Greeks. It included skills for mounting and dismounting a horse, and circus performance skills. The Greeks used gymnastics as military training. However, in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, the German physical educators created exercises for boys and young men on apparatus. Their design is considered as modern gymnastics. The Federation of International Gymnastics was founded in 1881. By the end of the Reprint 2025-26"}

The first world cup in gymnastics was organised in 1975. Forms of gymnastics The major forms of gymnastics are: Artistic gymnastics, Rhythmic gymnastics, Trampolining, Tumbling and Acrobatic Gymnastics. Artistic gymnastics Artistic gymnastics is usually divided into Men’s and Women’s Gymnastics. Men compete in six events. These are floor exercise, pommel horse, still rings/roman rings, vaulting table, parallel bars, and horizontal bar. Women compete on four events. These are floor exercise, vaulting table, uneven bars, and balancing beam. 1. Events for men (i) Floor Exercise: For this event a 12×12 square spring floor is required. A series of tumbling passes are performed to demonstrate flexibility, strength, and balance. The gymnast must also show strength skills, including circles, scales, and press handstands. Men’s floor routines usually have four passes that will total between 50–70 seconds and are performed without music. As per rules, male gymnasts touch each corner of the floor at least once during their routine. (ii) Pommel Horse: A typical pommel horse exercise involves both single leg and double leg skills. Single leg skills are generally found in the form of scissors, often done on the pommels. Double leg skill, however, is the main staple of this event. The gymnast swings both legs in a circular motion (clockwise or counterclockwise depending on preference) and performs such skills on all parts of the apparatus. Gymnasts will often include variations on a typical circling skill by turning or by straddling their legs. This makes the exercises of gymnast more challenging. A gymnast performs a dismount, either by swinging his body over the horse or landing after a handstand. (iii) Still Rings: The rings are attached to a wire cable from a point to 5.75 meters from the floor, and adjusted in height so, that the gymnast has room to hang freely and swing. The gymnast performs a Fig. 5.4: Pommel horse Reprint 2025-26"}

At least one static strength move is required, but some gymnast includes two or three strenghts. A routine should have a dismount at the end of routine. (iv) Vault: In this, the gymnasts sprint down a runway, which is a maximum of 25 meters in length, before hurdling onto a spring board. The body position is maintained while “punching” (blocking using only a shoulder movement) the vaulting board. The gymnast then rotates to a standing position. Multiple twists and somersaults are added before landing in case of advance gymnastics. Vaults depend on the speed of the run, the length of the hurdle, the power the gymnast generated from the legs and shoulder girdle and the kinesthetic awareness in the air. In case of more difficult and complex vaults the speed of rotation is more important. (v) Parallel Bars: Men perform on two bars. These are kept slightly further than a shoulder’s width apart and usually 1.75 m high. For executing a series of swings, balances, and releases require great strength and co- ordination. (vi) Horizontal Bar: A 2.8 cm thick steel or fiberglass bar raised 2.5m above the landing area is all the gymnasts have to hold onto as they perform giants (revolutions around the bar), release skills, twists, and changes of direction. By using all of the momentum from giants and then releasing at the proper point, enough height can be achieved for spectacular dismounts. Leather grips are usually used to help maintain a grip on the bar. 2. Events for women (i) Floor Exercise: The floor event occurs on a carpeted 12m × 12m square, usually consisting of hard foam over a layer of plywood, which is supported by springs or foam blocks generally called a “spring” floor. Female gymnasts perform a choreographed routine of 50 to 70 seconds in this event. The routine should consist of tumbling lines, series of jumps, dance elements, acrobatic skills, and turns.

{"id": "class 9__phe__p72__c1", "text": "Health and Physical Education - Class X 60 (ii) Vault: In the vaulting events gymnasts sprint down a 25 meters (82 ft) runway, jump onto or perform a round off entry onto a beat board or spring board, land momentarily, inverted on the hands on the vaulting horse or vaulting table. Then they spring off this platform to a two footed landing. Every gymnast starts at a different point on the vault runway depending on her height and strength. The post flight segment may include one or more multiple somersaults, and/or twisting movements. In vaults with round-off entries, gymnasts “round-off” so that hands are on the runway while the feet land on the springboard. From the round-off position the gymnast travels backwards as in a back handspring so that the hands land on the vaulting platform (horse). She then blocks off the vaulting platform into various twisting and somersaulting combinations. (iii) Uneven Bars: On the uneven bars (also known as asymmetric bars), the gymnast performs a routine on two horizontal bars set at different heights. The height is generally fixed, but the width may be adjusted. Gymnasts perform swinging, circling, transitional, and release moves, as well as moves that pass through the handstand. Usually in higher levels of gymnastics, leather grips are worn to ensure that the gymnast maintains a grip on the bar, and to protect the hands from blisters and tears. (iv) Balance Beam: The gymnast performs a choreographed routine from 70 to 90 seconds in length consisting of leaps, acrobatic skills, turns and dance elements on a padded spring beam. Apparatus norms set by the International Gymnastics Federation specify that the beam must be 125 cm (4’) high, 500 cm (16’) long, and 10 cm (4.5”) wide. The event requires in particular, balance, flexibility and strength. 3. Rhythmic gymnastics Only women compete in rhythmic gymnastics, although there is a new version of this discipline for men being pioneered in Japan. This combines elements of ballet, gymnastics, dance and apparatus manipulation. The sport involves the performance of five separate routines with the use of five apparatus – Ball, Ribbon, Hoop, Clubs, Rope on a floor area, with a much greater emphasis on the aesthetic rather than the acrobatic.

Acrobatic gymnastics Acrobatic gymnastics is one of the oldest forms of organised physical activities, and today it is being reorganised, revitalised by changes and renewed interest. The International Federation of Sports Acrobatics (IFSA) was founded in Moscow in 1973. United States Sports Acrobatics (USSA) was founded in 1975. It was merged with International Gymnastics federation (FIG) in 1999. Sports Acrobatics was demonstration sports at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. Now, it is an accepted competitive sport. It is very effective for the development of physical fitness and graceful posture. Acrobatic gymnastics is a group gymnastic discipline for both men and women. Acrobats in groups of two, three and four perform routines with the heads, hands and feet of their partners. They may, subject to regulations (e.g. instrumental), pick their own music. 5. Tumbling and trampolining Tumbling, also known as power tumbling, is a gymnastics sporting discipline which combines skills of artistic gymnastics with those of trampolining. It is sometimes practiced on a 25-meter-long spring track, competitors both male and female, perform two passes, each containing eight skills, along the track. Table Tennis Table Tennis is also known as Ping-Pong, in which two or four players participate using table-tennis rackets on a plain hard surface called Table, which is divided by a net. History The game of Table Tennis probably descended from the game of ‘Royal Tennis’, which was played in the medieval era (12th century A.D.) Table Tennis was probably played with improvised equipment in England during the last quarter of 19th century. Evidence show that David Foster in England patented an action game of Tennis on Table in 1890. One year later John Jaques came out with a game called Gossima. In 1900, a celluloid ball was introduced by Jaques and the name was given as ‘Ping-Pong’. Table Tennis is controlled by ITTF (International Table Tennis Federation) which was founded in 1926 with headquarters in Berlin. It was introduced in Olympics in 1988 in Seoul, South Korea. First World Championship of Table-Tennis was held in London in 1926. TTFI (Table-Tennis Federation of India) was formed in 1926 in Calcutta, now known as Kolkata. Reprint 2025-26"}

Fundamental techniques 1. Grip: Players grip their rackets in a variety of ways. The manner in which players grip their rackets can be classified into two major categories i.e. Pen hold grip (mainly used by Chinese and Korean) and shake hand or Orthodox grip (commonly used). •• Pen hold grip: In this, one grips the racket in such a way as one holds a pen. It involves index finger and think joining each other across the handle and curling the middle, ring and fourth finger on the back of the blade. The three fingers however, will always remain touching one another. Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 9__phe__p75__c1", "text": "Individual Games and Sports II 63 Fig. 5.10: Pen hold grip •• Shake hand grip: In this grip, the racket is held in such a way as one shakes hand with someone. The shake hand grip is used due to increasingly fast nature of the game, making the backhand stroke more effective. 2. Services: There are different kind, of services, such as, long service, short service, spin service, flat service, high toss service and back-hand or forehand service. 3. Types of strokes: The two types of strokes are offensive and defensive including backhand and forehand. (i) Offensive strokes (drive, loop drive, loop, loop kill, hook, counter drive, flip and smash) a) Drive: The racket is primarily perpendicular to the direction of the stroke, and most of the energy applied to the ball results in speed rather than spin, creating a shot that does not arc much, but it is fast enough to make it difficult to return. b) Loop drive: The racket is much more parallel to the direction of the stroke (closed) and the racket thus grazes the ball, resulting in a large amount of topspin. Variations in spin and speed add to the effectiveness of this shot. c) Loop: The loop produces a more pronounced loopy arc, with a higher trajectory and extreme topspin, but is typically slower. d) Loop kill: The loop kill produces a flatter arc, with higher speed that resembles a speed drive but with stronger topspin. e) Hook: It is similar to a regular Loop, but carries a tilted topspin (or is referred as the “top-side” spin), it bounces sideways and downward upon hitting the table. f) Counter drive: It is a counter attack against drives (normally high loop drives). One has Reprint 2025-26"}

The racket is held closed and near to the ball, which is hit with a short movement off the bounce (before reaching the highest point) so that the ball travels faster to the other side. g) Flip: When a player tries to attack a ball that has not bounced beyond the edge of the table, however the ball may still be attacked, and the resulting shot is called flip because the back swing is compressed into a quick wrist action. h) Smash: Smash is executed when his or her opponent has returned a ball that bounces too high and/ or too close to the net. Smashing is a large back swing and rapid acceleration imparting as much speed on the ball as possible. (ii) Defensive strokes a) Push or Slice: The push is usually used for keeping the point alive and creating offensive opportunities. A push resembles a tennis slice, the racket cuts underneath the ball, imparting backspin and causing the ball to float slowly to the other side of the table. Offensive players should only push for variation and not for general rallies. b) Chop: A chop or cut is the defensive, backspin counterpart to the offensive loop drive. A chop is essentially a bigger, heavier slice, taken well back from the table. Sometimes a defensive player can impart no spin on the ball during a chop, or frequently add right- or left-hand spin to the ball. This may further confuse his/ her opponent. c) Block: A block is executed by simply putting the racket in front of the ball, the ball rebounds back toward the opponent with nearly as much energy as it came in with. This is not as easy as it sounds, because the ball’s spin, speed, and location, all influence the correct angle of a block. d) Side spin drive: The premise of this move is to put a spin on the ball either to the right or the left of the racket. The execution of this move is similar to a slice, but to the right or left, instead of down. This spin will result in the ball curving to the side but bouncing in the opposite direction when the opponent returns it. Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 9__phe__p77__c1", "text": "Individual Games and Sports II 65 e) Lob: The defensive High Ball or Lob is deceptive in its simplicity. To execute a High Ball, a defensive player first backs off the table 8-10 meters; then, the stroke itself consists of simply lifting the ball to an enormous height before it falls back to the opponent’s side of the table. A High Ball is inherently a creative shot, and can have nearly any kind of spin. f) Drop shot: The drop shot is a high level stroke, used as another variation for close-to-table strokes. The player has position the racket close to the ball and just let the ball touch it (without any hand movement) in a way that the ball stays close to the net with almost no speed and spin, and touches the other side of the table more than twice if the opponent doesn’t reach it. Skills Forehand drive •• Keep arm close to the torso. •• Forearm makes 90° with the upper arm. •• Draw the forearm back to another 45°. •• Let the waist turn naturally along with the arm and shift your weight towards the right foot. •• Swing forward with a slight upward motion while shifting your weight back to left foot. •• Elbow should be used as a pivot point and should only move a little forward in the follow through.

Equipment (i) Racquets: Tennis racquet must adhere to the following guidelines — •• The hitting area, composed of the strings, must be flat and generally uniform. •• The frame of the hitting area may not be more than 29 inches in length and 12.5 inches in width. •• The entire racquet must be of a fixed shape, size, weight, and weight distribution. There may not be any energy source built into the racquet. •• The racquet must not provide any kind of communication, instruction or advice to the player during the match. (ii) Balls: Tennis balls are of hollow rubber with a felt coating. Traditionally white, the predominant colour was gradually changed to optic yellow in the latter part of the 20th century to ensure better visibility. (iii) Court •• Tennis is played on a rectangular, flat surface, usually grass or clay, a hard court of concrete and/or asphalt and occasionally carpet (indoor). The court is 78 feet (23.77 m) long, and 27 feet (8.23 m) wide for singles matches and 36 ft (10.97 m) for doubles’ matches. •• Additional clear space around the court is required for players so as to reach over run balls. •• A net is stretched across the full width of the court, parallel with the baselines, dividing it into two equal ends. The net is 3 feet 6 inches (1.07 m) high at the posts and 3 feet (91.4 cm) high in the center. (iv) Lines •• The lines that delineate the width of the court are called the baseline (farthest back) and the service line (middle of the court). •• The short mark in the center of each baseline is referred to as either the hash mark or the center mark.

The terminology is extended to sets (set point), matches (match point), and even championships (championship point). •• A break point occurs if the receiver, not the sever, has a chance to win the game with the next point. Break points are of particular importance because serving is generally considered advantageous, with the server being expected to win games in which they are serving. •• A receiver who has one (score of 30–40), two (score of 15–40) or three (score of love-40) consecutive chances to win the game has break point, double break point or triple break point, respectively. •• If the leading player wins that game, the player wins the set 7–5. If the trailing player wins the game, a tie-break is played.

Grip A grip is a way of holding the racquet in order to hit shots during a match. There are three types of grip. i. Forehand: the tennis forehand is a stroke in which the inner side of the palm of the dominant hand that is holding the racket faces forward. The forehand stroke is made by swinging the racket across one’s body in the direction of where one wants to land the ball. ii. Backhand: The backhand is a tennis stroke in which one swings the racquet around one’s body with the back of the hand preceding the palm. iii. The Serve (Service): A serve in tennis is a shot to start a pint. A player will hit the ball with racquet so it will fall into the diagonally opposite service box without being stopped by the net.

It employs major muscle groups of the body leading to a well-developed flexible muscular system. Swimming is also important for physical rehabilitation for people suffering from disabilities or those recovering from injuries.

It is highly competitive with the application of science. It is getting transformed from an art to science. Now, the importance is given to strategy and tactics for completing and pacing the race. In order to achieve the best performance, a swimmer must learn to distribute the distance economically and thoughtfully throughout the race. Tactics in swimming during different races can be categorised in three different phase — (i) Sprint races (ii) Middle distance races (iii) Long distance races Sprint races The 50 m race or the sprint race depends on the start, maintaining the speed and a good finish. Middle and Long distance races In these races, the key word is to build endurance and speed. In middle and long distance races, the swimmer tries to prevent building up high oxygen debt. Swimming at a very fast pace will accumulate a high level of oxygen debt early in the race and will experience an immediate drop in speed. Swimmer may sometimes prefer to begin faster than an ideal pace and attempt to get out in front avoiding the choppy waters. Some swimmers like to swim the strategy races in relation to the opponent.

To play basketball, students should learn and practice the basic skills of dribbling, passing, receiving and shooting. History The game of basketball originated at the Springfield College of Physical Education, Massachusetts, USA in 1891, invented by Dr. James Naismith. In 1894, Naismith fixed the first 13 rules which still form the basis of modern basketball. In India, the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) at Kolkata introduced basketball for the first time. Later the YMCA established at Madras in 1920 played an important role in the development of this game. Today basketball is one of the most favourite games in many schools and colleges. The game is played by both men and women of all ages and ability. In order to promote Basketball at National and International levels the Basketball Federation of India was set up in 1950. The first National Basketball tournament was held in Delhi in 1934 and thereafter it was organised every two years until 1951. After that it started being organised annually.

Here are examples of the three basic categories of team defences. In addition, each category comprises of an assortment of different variations. •• Man to man defence: Man-to-man defences match up the defenders against specific offensive players. Defenders are usually assigned to be matched up with offensive players by size and ability. •• Zone Defence: In Zone defence, defenders are assigned to guard specific areas on the court. Zones are named or designated by their player alignments. •• Combined Defence: A third type of defence that can be deployed is the combination defence. With combina- tion defences, some of the players are assigned to play man-to-man while the rest of the defenders play zone. Combination defences are usually deployed in an effort to stop or neutralise great individual offensive players. Rebounding The objective of rebounding is to successfully gain possession of the basketball after a missed field point or free throw, as it rebounds from the ring or backboard. This plays a major role in the game, as most possessions end when a team misses a shot. There are two categories of rebounds: offensive rebounds, in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side and does not change possession, and defensive rebounds, in which the defending team gains possession of the loose ball. The majority of rebounds are defensive, as the team on defence tends to be in better position to recover missed shots. Reprint 2025-26"}

Cricket became a generally adopted sport in the second half of the seventeenth century. The Hambeldon club which was founded in about 1750’s had played a significant part in the evolution of the game. It was superseded by the Marylebone Cricket Club (M.C.C) with its headquarters at Lords, London. Cricket became an international game with the formation of the Imperial Cricket Conference (I.C.C) in 1909. The name of Imperial Cricket Conference was changed to International Cricket Conference (later, Council) to enable countries outside the common wealth to become its members. The first Limited Over International cricket match was played in 1971 at Melbourne. The governing International Cricket Council (ICC) saw its potential and staged the first limited over Cricket World Cup in 1975. The first edition of limited over Cricket world cup won by West Indies. In the 21st century, a new limited over form, Twenty 20, has made an immediate impact. The first T-20 international match took place on August 5 2004, between the women’s teams of England and New Zealand. The first T-20 international match between men’s teams was played on February 17 2005, between Australia and New Zealand. The first T-20 World Cup was played in South Africa in 2007. India won the first edition of T-20 World Cup. An all India team went on a tour of England in 1911 under Maharaja Bhupinder Singh of Patiala. The Indian Cricket Control Board came into being towards the end of 1928. The national championship for the Ranji Trophy began in 1935. India entered the international arena and played its first official Test against England in 1932. Meanwhile Prince Ranjit Singhji of Nawanagar who had gone to England for further studies, made a remarkable name for himself in the game of cricket.

{"id": "class 9__phe__p97__c1", "text": "Team Games and Sports I 85 Ways to score runs The aim of the batsmen is to score runs. One of the main cricket rules for batsmen to score runs is that they must run to the pitch at each other’s end (from one end to the other), hence score one run. Cricket rules state that, they may run multiple runs per shot. As well as while running they can also score runs by hitting boundaries. A batsman hits a boundary and scores 4 or 6 runs. A four and six both are scored by hitting the ball. If it crosses the boundary after touching the ground it is considered as four and if the ball crosses boundary before touching the ground it is considered as six. Cricket rules also state that once a 4 or 6 has been scored any runs physically scored by the batsman by running between the wickets are null and void. Other ways runs can be scored according to the cricket rules include no balls, wide balls, byes and leg byes. Cricket rules state that all runs scored by these methods are awarded to the batting team but not the individual batters. • • A No Ball can be declared for many reasons: If the heel of the bowler’s front foot lands on or in front of the popping crease or if the bowler’s back foot touches then outside the return crease the ball is declared no ball. If the bowler bowls the ball from the wrong place, the ball is declared dangerous (often happens when bowled at the batsmen’s body on the full), bounces more than twice or rolls before reaching the batsman or if fielders are standing in illegal positions. The batsman can hit a No ball and score runs off it but cannot be out from a No ball except if they are run out, hit the ball twice, handle the ball or obstruct the field. The batsman gains any runs scored off the no ball for his shot while the team also gains one run for the no ball itself. • • A Wide Ball will be declared if the umpire thinks the batsman did not have a reasonable opportunity to score off the delivery. However if the delivery is bowled over the batsmen’s head it will not be declared a wide but a no ball. Umpires are much stricter on wide deliveries in the shorter format of the game while being much more relaxed in test cricket. A wide delivery will add one run to the batting team and any runs scored by the batsman. The batsman is not supposed to be declared ‘out’ off a wide delivery except if they are stumped, run out, handle the ball, hit their wicket or obstruct the field. •• A Bye is where a ball that isn’t a no ball or wide passes the striking batsman and runs are scored without the batsman hitting the ball.

However no runs can be scored if the striking batsman didn’t attempt to play a shot or if he was avoiding the ball. Types of ‘out’ in cricket Ways batsmen can be given ‘Out’ according to cricket rules: There are a number of different ways a batsman can be given out in the game of cricket. When a bowler gets a batsman out it is said that the bowler gets a ‘wicket’. Following are the different ways, a batsman can be given out according to the rules of cricket: Fig. 6.9: Bowled •• Bowled – Cricket rules state that if the ball is bowled and hits the striking batsman’s wickets the batsman is given out (as long as at least one bail is removed by the ball). It does not matter whether the ball has touched the batsman’s bat, gloves, body or any other part of the batsman. However, the ball is not allowed to have touched another player or umpire before hitting the wickets. •• Caught – Cricket rules state that if a batsman while playing the ball, either it touches his bat, hand or glove holding the bat then the batsman can be caught out. This is done by the fielders, wicket keeper or bowler catching the ball on the full (before it bounces). If this is done then cricket rules state the batsman is out. •• Leg before Wicket (LBW) – If the ball is bowled and hits the .batsman first without touching the bat, then an LBW decision is possible. However for the umpire to give this out he must first look at some of the factors stated in the cricket rules. The first thing the umpire Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 9__phe__p99__c1", "text": "Team Games and Sports I 87 need to decide is that if is not a no ball, would the ball have hit the wickets if the batsman was not there. If his, answer to this is yes and the ball was not pitched on the leg side of the wicket he can safely give the batsman out. However, if the ball hits the batsman outside the line of off stump while he was attempting to play a stroke then he is not out. •• Stumped – A batsman can be given out according to cricket rules when the wicketkeeper puts down his wicket while, he is out of his crease and not attempting a run (if he is attempting a run it would be a run out). •• Retired Out – A batsman leaves the field without the permission of umpire for any resource like, illness, injury etc. Than is given as retired out. •• Run Out – Cricket rules state that a batsman is out if no part of his bat or body is grounded behind the popping crease while the ball is in play and the wicket is fairly put down by the fielding side. •• Hit Wicket – Cricket rules specify that if a batsman hits his wicket down with his bat or body after the bowler has entered his delivery stride and the ball is in play then he is out. •• Handled the Ball – Cricket rules allow the batsman to be given out if he willingly handles the ball with the hand that is not touching the bat without the consent of the opposition or umpire. •• Timed Out – An incoming batsman must be ready to face a ball or be at the non strikers end with his partner within three minutes of the outgoing batsman being dismissed. If this is not done the incoming batsman can be given timed out. •• Hit the Ball Twice – Cricket rules state that if a batsman hits a ball twice other than for the purpose of protecting his wicket or with consent from the opposition, he is out. •• Obstructing the Field – A batsman is out if he intentionally obstructs the opposition by word or action There are many other cricket rules. However these are most of the basics and will get you well on your way to playing the game. Many of the more advanced rules and laws can be learned along the way and are not vital to general play. If any batsman leaves the field of play without the Umpire’s consent for any reason other than injury or incapacity, he may resume the innings only with the consent of the opposing captain. If he fails to resume his innings, he is out. For the purposes of calculating a batting average, retired out is considered a dismissal. Reprint 2025-26"}

The bat is kept angled and very close to the front pad to prevent the ball going through bat and pad. • • The top hand is firm at the top of the handle while the bottom hand is relaxed, with the thumb and index finger loosely holding the bat. The back leg should be fully extended with the heel raised off the ground but remaining parallel to the crease. • • The weight of the back foot should be on the inside of the right toe and care should be taken not to turn it or drag it out of the crease. • • The front foot defensive stroke can be played with the bat slightly behind or in front of the pad depend- ing on the nature of the wicket and the proficiency of the bowler.

On drive • • On drive is played to a over-pitched ball on and around the leg stump. • • This has been considered to be a difficult shot to play.

The follow through is generally checked below shoulder height. Back foot defence •• The back foot defensive stroke is played to a short- pitched ball in line with the stumps, which is not short enough to play and attacking shot. • • The back foot is moved back and across to the line of the ball with the front naturally following it. The bat is brought down close to the body with the head steady and over the ball. • • The back foot must remain parallel to the crease as far as possible to maintain the sideways position of the body with the top hand firm and in control, and the bottom hand holding the bat loosely. • • To keep the bat straight, the left elbow is held high next to the head. Care should be taken to maintain the balance at the time of playing the ball and to remain ‘side-on’ as this presents a smaller target for short rising deliveries. • • The back foot defence can also be played with the body beside the line of the ball, but here the batsman must resist the temptation to follow the movement of the ball away from him.

Also commonly known as soccer, it is a game that involves kicking a ball with the foot to score a point. It is played between two teams with a spherical ball on a rectangular field of grass or green artificial turf. There is a goal post at each end of the rectangular field and errected at the middle of base line. Points are scored by moving the ball to an opposing team’s end of the field and putting it between two goal posts. Players are required to move the ball by kicking, dribbling, carrying, and passing. The team that scores more points than the other by the end of the match wins the game. History According to FIFA (Federation International de Football Association), the “very earliest form of the game was played in china during the second and third centuries. The game was later developed in England and the rules of football were formulated in India, football began its journey when the British rulers brought it with them and in no time it became popular in the masses. The first recorded game here took place between the ‘Calcutta Club of Civilians’ and the ‘Gentlemen of Barrackpore’ in 1854. The first ever football club in India, the ‘Calcutta Football Club’ was founded in 1872. The first football association, “the Indian Football Association” (IFA) was established in Calcutta in 1893, though there was no Indian on its board till 1930s. It was later, replaced by All India Football Federation (AIFF). The Durand Cup Tournament is the oldest in India and the one of the oldest in the world, was started in Shimla in 1888. The decade of 1951 to 1962 is known as the golden era in the history of Indian football, as the country put up commendable performances in a number of international competitions.

Rules According to the official rules of football guide, the players need to execute the game in a fair and accepted manner. The football match is played in two halves of 45 minutes each. There are several rules in the game of football regarding the field, players, penalties, offence and defence. Start and restart of play A coin toss takes place before the game starts, the winner of the toss will get the choice of choosing the end to attack. At the kick-off, all players from each side must be in their own halves of the field. The kick-off takes place on the centre spot in the centre circle. The player who kicks off cannot touch it again until another player has made contact. Punishment for offences If the player persistently offends during a match, the referee can choose to take action. First the Yellow Card as a caution is shown to a player. Any offence after the second one leads to Red card. If they showed a red card to a player it means that player is expelled from the match. A straight red card (no previous caution) can be shown for extreme offences, such as, serious foul play, violent conduct, spitting, deliberately handling the ball to prevent a goal, a professional foul (denying a goal scoring opportunity) and insulting language and/or gestures. Free kicks Whenever a free kick is taken, the players on the opposite side must be at least 10 yards away from the ball until it is kicked. If this rule is not adhered to, the kick is retaken. There are two types of free kicks awarded, depending on the nature of the offence: (i) Direct Free Kick — allows the team to take a direct shot at the opponent`s goal. (ii) Indirect Free Kick — a direct strike on goal is not permitted. It means a second player has to touch the ball after the kick is taken to score a goal. Penalty kick A penalty kick is awarded for offences taking place in the penalty and goal areas. A nominated member of the team is allowed to strike at goal from the penalty spot, with only the goalkeeper to beat. The goalkeeper must remain on his line until the ball has been kicked, and all other players must be outside the penalty area behind the penalty spot. After the Reprint 2025-26"}

Throw-in A throw-in is awarded when the whole ball crosses the touch line (conceded by the team who last touched the ball). It is delivered on the field of play with both hands and from behind and over the player’s head. Otherwise it is deemed to be a foul throw and a throw-in is given to the opposition. It cannot go directly to the goalkeeper’s hands (if on the same team). A goal cannot be scored directly from a throw-in. Corner kick A corner kick is awarded once the whole ball crosses the goal line of the opposition, after touching one of their players. A kick is taken from the corner of whichever side the ball travelled over the field. Opponents must be 10 yards from the corner arc and the kicker cannot touch the ball a second time without having touched by any other player. Fundamental skills Receiving Receiving a ball on the ground is different than receiving a ball in air. Keep your eye on the ball, select the foot to receive the ball, don’t stop the ball, prepare it for new action or move, shot, dribble, pass. Passing Passing involves giving the ball to partners. Perfect decision making is required before a perfect pass. Before pass, see the target, approach the ball, and look at the ball holding the head steady. Strike the correct area of the ball with lacked ankle, make sure of follow through and transfer of weight forward. Shooting Shooting uses the same elements as used in passing, the difference is that the ball is to be passed to the goal keeper to convert the score for the team. Player should look up to see the position of goal keeper, choosing the area to shoot the ball while make a proper contact with the ball with proper follow through. Trapping It is a method of gaining control of the ball. Trapping uses the feet, thigh, or chest to bring the ball to the ground. Reprint 2025-26"}

However, the name Field Hockey is used in countries in which the word Hockey is generally reserved for another form of hockey, such as ice hockey or street hockey. The players should learn and practice the basic skills of dribbling, passing, tapping and hitting. They should learn how to attack and score goals and how to work with others to defend and stop goals from being scored. To do this they need to learn how to keep possession by dribbling effectively and moving the ball accurately and quickly between players. As they progress, skills should become more consistent and efficient, and the players should be introduced to set play situations. Fig. 6.17: Players playing hockey History The history of the game of hockey has its roots well laid in the world’s early civilisations.

Even though many ancient civilisations played hockey in different variations, the modern game of field hockey was developed in the British Isles in the 19th century. It was introduced in India by the British Army regiments and the game soon became popular. It was during this time that the London Hockey Association was formed and the rules for playing hockey were standardised. In 1924, the International Hockey Federation (FIH) was founded and three years later, the International Federation of Women’s Hockey followed. In India, the first hockey club came up in Calcutta in 1885-86 and soon Bombay and Punjab followed. Making its Olympic debut at the 1928 Amsterdam Games, Indian hockey team won its first Olympic gold, without conceding a single goal. The hallmark of this ruthless domination was the wizardry of Indian hockey legend, Dhyan Chand, who mesmerised the Amsterdam crowd with his dazzling skills. From 1928 to 1956, India won six consecutive Olympic gold medals, while winning 24 consecutive matches. It was the golden era of Indian hockey, when India produced some of the finest players the game has ever seen.

A spot 0.15m in diameter, called the penalty spot, is marked with its centre 6.40 m from the centre of each goal. Equipment Each player carries a stick, normally a little over 3 feet (90 centimeters) long, 2 inches wide and traditionally made of wood but now often made with fiberglass, Kevlar and carbon fiber composites, with a rounded handle flattening out on one side and with a hook at the bottom. Rules The rules set by the International Hockey Federation FIH are used worldwide. General play Prior to the start of the game, a coin is tossed and the winning captain can choose a starting end or start with the ball. The game time is divided into four quarters of 15 minutes each 15-02-15-10-15-2-15. At the start of each quarter as well as after goals are scored, play is started with a pass from the centre of the field. Field players may only play the ball with the flat side of the stick. Tackling is permitted as long as the tackler does not make contact with the attacker or his stick before playing the ball (contact after the tackle may also be penalised if the tackle was made from a position where contact was inevitable). Further, the player with the ball may not deliberately use his body or stick to shield the ball from a legitimate tackle. When the ball passes over the sidelines, it is returned to play from sideline either by individual player by himself or with a push or hit, taken by a member of the team whose players were not the last to touch the ball before crossing the sideline. If it crosses the goal line after last touched by an attacker, a 15 mt hit or pass can be made by any player of the defending team. A 15 mt hit is also awarded for offenses committed by the attacking side within 15 mt of the end, of the pitch they are attacking.

Penalty corner The penalty corner is set play that is awarded against a defending team when any offence is committed in the defensive circle, and may be awarded when a deliberate offence is committed in the defending 23 m area, or when the defending team deliberately plays the ball over the back line. Penalty stroke A penalty stroke is awarded when defenders commit a deliberate foul in the circle which deprives an attacker of possession or the opportunity to play the ball. This penalty is being taken by a single attacker against the goalkeeper, and is taken from a spot 6.4 m from the penalty spot and directly in front of the goal. The goalkeeper must stand with heels on the goal line, and cannot move his feet until the ball is played. On the umpire’s whistle, the striker may push or flick the ball at the goal, which the goalkeeper attempts to save. The player taking the penalty shot may not touch the ball twice. Hitting or dragging or tapping the ball is also forbidden. If the shot is saved, play is restarted with 15 mt hit to the defenders; if a goal is scored, play is restarted from the centre line.

Each team works together to hit an inflated ball over a high net. Each team tries to score points by grounding the ball on the other team’s court. Volleyball is a rebound game where one cannot hold or catch the ball; every contact must be a rebound action. It is essential for the player to be in the right place at the right time if the game is to be played in a controlled manner.

History Originally named Mintonette, it was created as a gentle indoor sport for older players to be able to exert a bit of athletic effort by keeping the ball in the air. The idea of using a net was borrowed from tennis. It was raised to a height above the average man’s height. During a demonstration game, someone remarked that the players seemed to be volleying the ball back and forth over the net, and perhaps “volleyball” would be a more descriptive name for the sport. The game of Volleyball was invented by William G. Morgan in the year 1895 in Holyoke, Massachusetts by YMCA (USA). It was invented as a recreational game.

A player on one of the teams begins a ‘rally’ by serving the ball from behind the back line of the court, over the net, and into the receiving team’s court. The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court. The rally continues, with each team allowed up to three consecutive touches, until either a team grounds the ball on the opponent’s court and wins the rally or a team commits a fault and loses the rally. The team that wins the rally is awarded a point, and serves the ball to start the next rally. The ball is usually played with the hands or arms, but players can legally strike or push the ball with any part of the body.

It is a game of attack and defense. The two teams occupy opposite halves of a field and take turn in sending a ‘Raider’ into the other half. In order to win points, members of the opposite team are tagged and the raider tries to return to half, holding the breath and chanting, “Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi”.

There is also another school of thought, in India, which believes that this game is a version of Chakravyuha, used in Mahabharata. The game was demonstrated for the first time at the international level during 1936 in Berlin Olympics by Hanuman Vyayam Pracharak Mandal, Amravati, Maharashtra. The game was introduced in the Indian Olympic Games at Calcutta in 1938. In 1950, the All India Kabaddi Federation came into existence and compiled standard rules. The Amateur Kabaddi Federation of India (AKFI) was founded in 1973. After formation of the AKFI, the first men’s nationals were held in Madras (Chennai), while the women’s were held in Calcutta (Kolkata) in 1955. The Asian Kabaddi Federation (AKF) was founded in 1978. AKF is affiliated to Olympic Council of Asia. The parent body designated to regulate the game at the international level is International Kabaddi Federation (IKF). The Kabaddi World Cup was first played in 2004, then in 2007 and 2010.

Fundamental skills Skills The skills used by the raider in kabaddi are called offensive skills. The skills used by the antis are called defensive skills. During a raid, the raider has to make maximum use of his limbs to come in contact or touch the opponents in order to score points. This is accomplished through leg touches, such as, toe touch, foot touch, squat leg, thrust, kicks, etc., with lower limbs and through hand touches with upper limbs. Offensive skills a) Touch: Touch is a fundamental and the easiest skill, which every raider applies in one or the other forms. There are different kinds of touches such as — (i) Hand touch: (a) running hand touch (b) stooping hand touch (c) turning hand-touch (d) hopping hand touch (e) fake and touch (ii) Toe touch: This offensive skill is used by almost every raider. A raider can execute this Reprint 2025-26"}

During the course of a raid, the raider will move in different angles, according to the positions and moves of the opponents. At the same time, in order to apply this skill, the raider requires to extend his leg towards the opponent suddenly. (iii) Foot touch: The modern toe touch is a moderate form of foot-touch. The major difference between these two skills is that in foot-touch, the raider tries to touch the opponents with complete foot whereas in toe touch, toe is used to touch the opponents. This skill helps the raider to cover more area in the opponent’s court and has an advantage over toe touch. b) Mule kick: It is very useful in critical situations. Mule kick is a thrust or blow in the air, by the raider, with leg, to touch an anti. There are various types of kicks, such as — i. Back kick: Kicking the anti who comes behind the raider during the course of raid is known as back kick. The different forms of back kick are: (i) running back kick (ii) standing back kick (iii) fake and kick (iv) taking a turn and back kick. ii. Side kick: Raiders who raid from second to second and attack the central zone will find this skill the most suitable. The method and principle of kick are the same as in the case of back kick. The only difference between the two is that the area to be covered is sideward. iii. Curve kick is also called a mule kick as the leg lifted to kick at the anties takes a curve from back to the side. This type of kick will enable the raider to cover more area with the attacking leg. At the same time it enables the raider to change his direction. Defensive skills a) Ankle hold: This is a counter skill used by defensive players against leg thrusts and foot touches during an attack or raid. A team, which has mastery over ankle hold, can plan different strategies and tactics in various situations, such as, (a) lifting up (b) pulling back (c) changing direction of the raider.

{"id": "class 9__phe__p129__c1", "text": "Team Games and Sports II 117 b) Thigh hold: This skill is a good defensive skill. Every team uses this technique as a planned and surprise tactic. For example: (a) Taking one step forward and hold — Taking one step forward means holding the raider’s thigh on wrong step or rear leg (b) thigh hold from behind. c) Waist hold or trunk hold: Waist hold is a skill used by a defender to catch the raider from behind. d) Wrist hold: Wrist hold is also a defensive skill and used occasionally only when a situation presents itself. This hold is rarely used now a days. e) Blocking: It is a defensive skill used by covers and corners. Blocking is an act of creating a wall of obstruction in the path of the raider to prevent the movement. The aim of blocking is not just to obstruct the path, but also to catch the raider. Tactics Tactics means exploiting a given situation to one’s advantage. This is also done to create a situation to suit one’s purpose. The raider may increase or decrease the tempo of the game depending on the situation. In order to do this the player may adopt a passive raid or an aggressive raid by creating a situation for a struggle. Sometimes the raider may pass time in the last few minutes of the game, especially when the team is leading and the opponents are playing an aggressive game. Keeping in view the game situation, different tactics adopted by the raider. Retreat Unless the raider returns to home court safely after the raid, the raid cannot be treated as successful. This is called a retreat. The raider has to pre-plan the path of retreat before starting the raid. While retreating to home court, the raider should keep the following points in view — •• The raider does not give room for pursuit. •• The raider regains their defensive position quickly before the opponent team’s raider begins the raid. •• While returning to home court, the raider must pass only through the midline. Raid Raid is the offence part of the game. The main feature of the game is raiding on the opponent’s court, alternatively by both the team players. The defence is done with teamwork while only one player makes an attack. Reprint 2025-26"}

In the term judo, ‘ju’ means ‘gentle’ and ‘do’ means ‘the way or path’. Judo was developed in Japan in the late 19th century by using the principles of balance and leverage adapted from jujutsu. Its most prominent feature is its competitive element, where the objective is to either throw or putdown one’s opponent to the ground, immobilise or otherwise subdue one’s opponent with a grappling maneuver, or force an opponent to submit by joint locking or by executing a stranglehold or choke. Strikes and thrusts by hands and feet as well as self-defense are a part of judo. Many are trained in Judo either for participation in competition or self-defense. History The history of judo starts with Japanese jujutsu. It was created by Professor Jigoro Kano and he believed that the techniques could be practiced as a competitive sport if the more dangerous techniques were omitted. By 1910 Judo was a recognised sport that could be safely engaged in and in 1911 it was adopted as a part of Japan’s educational system. In the same year, the Kodokan Judo Instructors’ Training Department, Kodokan Black Belt Association and Japan Athletic Association were formed. World War II saw a different development of Judo. Instead of being used for sport, Judo was being taught as a combat skill. Those selected for commando and special services training often achieved a high standard of expertise. When Japan hosted the 1964 Olympics, Judo was given its first opportunity as an event. Of the 16 medals awarded for Judo, Japan won three gold medals, and one silver medal. Judo was no longer a Japanese sport but had developed to become an international sport. There have been two main developments in Judo over the years. The first was the introduction of weight categories. Earlier everyone fought everyone else, with the result that, if two players were equally matched in skill, the bigger man usually won. Initially there were three categories, and later this was made into five. Inclusion of the sport in the Olympic Games in 1964 helped to hasten this important reform. There are different styles of Judo. With its inclusion in the Olympics, there has been a shift towards a contest style practice. In clubs where this style is taught, the practice becomes largely a continuous contest. Other schools stress on skills. They favour repetitive movements to make them instinctive and the development of speed through practice with little resistance. Fig. 7.5: Player playing Judo Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 9__phe__p135__c1", "text": "Team Games and Sports II 123 Rules Officials There are three officials who preside over a judo match. There is one referee who walks around inside the contest area and conducts the match. There are two judges who sit diagonally across the mat from one another, each in a corner. The two judges assist the referee and indicate when the contestant goes outside of the contest area. The referee is in charge of awarding points and accessing penalties and uses hand gestures to signal his decision. However, if a judge disagrees with a call, then the three officials take a vote and the decision is decided by a majority vote. In addition to the Judge and Referees there are also scorekeepers and timers. There is usually a scoreboard, which displays points and penalties and it can either be electronic or manual. Medical personnel are also on hand in the event of injury to a contestant. Contestants The two contestants, who are known as Judokas, compete for 5 minutes for men and 4 minutes for women. One contestant wears white uniform and the other a blue uniform. Uniforms The judokas wear loose-fitting judo uniforms called judogi, consisting of pants, a jacket and a belt. Judogi is made up of loose-fitting pants, a jacket and a belt that is tied around the waist. The jacket and pants are made of cotton. They are either blue or white and they are made so a rival should be able to get a grip on either one of them so as to be able to make a judo throw. One judoka will wear white the other blue. The belt is three meters long and it is wrapped around the waist twice. The color of the belt signifies the rank the combatant has reached. Competition area The entire competition area in judo is 46 to 53 feet square (14 to 16 meters). This area is made up of foam mats commonly referred to as tatami mats and the individual mats are 6.5 feet by 3.281 feet wide (2 meters long, a 1-meter wide). Inside the competition area is a contest area, which is 8-10 meters square. This contest area (shiaijo) is green in color, that would be 29.5 feet square (9-meters) and it will have a 3.281 foot (1-meter) red boundary around it. This is the danger zone and it alerts the competitor(s) (judoka) that they are about to go out of bounds. The area outside the danger zone is the safety zone. This zone is three meters wide and it is the out-of-bounds area. Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 9__phe__p136__c1", "text": "Health and Physical Education - Class X 124 In the middle of the contest area are two pieces of tape, one blue and one white 13.1 feet apart (4-meters). These two pieces of tape mark the place where the judoka will stand when they begin and end each bout. Contest A random draw, in the same weight category, is used to determine which contestants will be fighting each other. In the Olympic Games there are two pools, and each pool has its own single-elimination tournament. The two pool winners will compete for the gold medal, with the loser of this contest winning the silver medal. In each pool, the competitors who lose to a pool winner are then entered into a repechage round which is also a single-elimination tournament. The winners of the repechage pools will be the winners of the bronze medals. To win the contest a Judoka must score an Ippon a score that equals 10 points by using successful Judo techniques. If neither of the Judokas is able to score an Ippon or 10 points by the end of the match, the winner will be the Judoka who has scored the most points. In the event of a tie, for the first time at the 2004 Olympic Games, the “Golden Score” rule was used. If there is no winner after the five-minute period has ended, the referee announces the beginning of “Golden Score”. This will extend the match for an extra five- minute period and the contestant who scores the first point is declared the winner of the match. Judo penalties Two types of penalties may be awarded. One is shido and another is hansoku. After two shido are given, the third shido becomes hansoku-make and the victory is given to the opponent. This is an indirect hansoku-make and does not result in expulsion from the tournament. Wrestling Considered as one of the most ancient and oldest sport in the world, wrestling has also been equally popular in India. It is a form of combat sport involving grappling type techniques such as clinch, fighting, throws, take downs, joint locks and other grappling holds. A wrestling bout is a physical competition, between two (occasionally more) competitors or partners, who attempt to gain and maintain a superior position. There are a wide range of styles with varying rules, such as, traditional, historic and modern styles.

In India also it received regular patronage from the Emperors and Kings. Wrestling in India then was popularly known as Malla Yuddha. In famous Indian epic, Mahabharata, Bhima was considered to be a great wrestler of that time and some of the other great wrestlers included Jarasandha, Duryodhana, and Karna. Another Indian epic, Ramayana also mentions about wrestling and Hanuman is described as one of the great wrestlers of that time. Wrestling in India continued to increase its popularity during modern days. Even during the British rule, wrestling in India got encouraging support, as the British rulers included the game into the military practice. In fact, India was considered among the top 10 countries in wrestling till the 1960s. India also hosted the World Wrestling Championship at New Delhi in 1967. The term Kushti, which means wrestling, denotes both a local form of the art as well as a more global combat. Kushti is composed of three primary dimensions: dao, pench, and paintra (moves, counter-moves, and stance). There may be similarities between the daos known as multani, dhobi pat, and kalajangh and the corresponding freestyle moves known as arm drag, front hip throw, and fireman carry. But what is significantly different about wrestling in India is that wrestlers mostly wrestle in mud pits, engage in bouts that last for half an hour or more. At other times and under other circumstances Indian wrestlers follow clearly defined international guidelines, rules, and regulations. Do You Know?

This may cause stress in them. There are many occasions when they may get stressed or feel angry or frustrated. It is natural for adolescents to experience both positive and negative emotions. It is also necessary to express their feelings and emotions. There are positive and negative ways of expressing the emotions. It is pointed out that negative emotions and their expression in negative ways may be caused by certain stresses experienced by the adolescents. In today’s life, stress is becoming a major cause of many health-related problems. It is a known fact that chronic stress negatively affects health. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiac problems, depression, anxiety attacks, road-rage, etc., have become common now-a-days. The most common emotion faced by all of us during this COVID-19 pandemic is fear. It has also made us panicky and anxious to deal with such issues. Yoga can help us in dealing with stress and mental health issue during this time. In the management of stress, lifestyle plays an important role. A healthy lifestyle reduces stress and promotes one’s health. Here, it is important to recognise that stress can be tackled and definitely decreased. Many times, we may not necessarily be in control of the situations but we can control our over-all response to such situations. What is Stress? Stress can be understood as a state of physiological and psychological imbalance resulting from demanding or difficult situations which the person is not able to cope with.

{"id": "class 9__phe__p146__c1", "text": "Health and Physical Education - Class X 134 In day-to-day life, a person faces many situations. Some situations are easy to handle; while some are difficult. As a result, the body starts responding at physiological and psychological levels. At the physiological level, there may be changes in heart rate, pulse rate, blood pressure, secretions of hormones, etc. At the psychological level, there may be changes in attention, concentration, memory and alertness and also in the emotional state (like anger, fear, hate, sadness, etc.). Stress generally occurs as a result of major events in life, such as, tough competitions, getting low scores in an examination, recent break-up in friendship, not getting a good job, a fight with others, and so on. There are several other factors which may cause stress in a person, like, diseases, poor living conditions, poverty, problems in relationship, challenges of adolescence, wrong habits, high aspirations, unrealistic goals, death of a close relative, discrimination, fast changing life and many others. However, sometimes it may also occur due to minor issues, such as, not getting up early, not getting ready on time, reaching school late, not getting the desired food, arguments with a friend, not getting permission from parents for attending a late night party, and so on. Intensity of stress varies from person to person and generally depends on perception of a particular situation by that person. A situation may be easy to handle for one person, while it may pose a big challenge to another. For example, examination may cause stress in one student, while it may not affect another student. Stress which motivates us to perform better and learn new skills is beneficial. For example, getting admission in a new course, preparing for an examination or getting promotion may cause stress but this stress is beneficial as it finally contributes towards growth and development. Stress may be harmful also. When stress is severe and chronic it reduces efficiency of a person. This kind of stress may adversely affect our ability to feel, think and act. During severe stress, people may become restless and worried. They may not remember the things properly. Even small things may make them angry. You also might have observed that when you are in tension you become restless. You may not be able to focus on your studies and small things may cause irritation. Chronic and severe stress reduces our body’s ability to fight diseases. It can lead to various psychosomatic diseases, such as, peptic ulcer, migraine, diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, etc. It could even result in heart attack, brain stroke and death. Several psychological disorders, such as, anxiety attacks and depression may Activity 8.1 Think and discuss the following with your friends: Questions •• Have you ever experienced stress? •• What was the cause of it? •• How did you manage it? •• Can you think any other way by which you could have better managed it?

Therefore, management of stress is necessary Yoga as a Way of Life for Stress Management Yoga has been considered a panacea for managing the stress. In this context, we will discuss the role of yoga in developing a healthy lifestyle by which stress can be managed. Yoga practices when become a way of life, play an important role in stress management. You have learnt about asana, pranayama, kriya, mudra, bandha and meditation in Class IX. However, yoga is not limited to the physical postures, breathing techniques or meditation for a few minutes only. Rather yoga is a way of life also. It propounds several principles and practices, such as, asana, pranayama, kriya, mudra, bandha and meditation which are relevant to healthy living. Yogic principles and practices of healthy living can be adopted by all, irrespective of age, gender, profession or place. As a way of life, yoga gives direction about food, eating habits, thinking, recreational means and conduct. Yogic way of life, if adopted in true sense, empowers us to deal with stress and promote physical and mental health. The components of yogic way of life are — •• Ahara (Food) •• Vihara (Relaxation) •• Achara (Conduct) •• Vichara (Thinking) •• Vyavahara (Behaviour or actions) Ahara The principles of ahara are related to food consumption. Yoga emphasises on mitahara, which is related to quality and quantity of food and also the state of mind during the intake of food. As for the quality, the concept of mitahara implies that food should be freshly cooked, nutritious, nourishing and in the natural form. Regarding quantity of food, mitahara mentions that two quarters of the stomach should be filled with food, one quarter with liquid and the remaining quarter (one‑fourth) should be left empty for free flow of air. This implies that quantity of food may vary from person to person depending upon the individual requirements. It is very natural that a sportsperson will require more food as compared to a person who is doing desk job. Mitahara also advocates that the food should be eaten with positive state of Reprint 2025-26"}

You might have observed if someone eats while watching the television or in an angry mood or when the person’s attention is somewhere else, then they tend to just gulp down the food without enjoying it. So, the state of mind is also very important while eating. Thus, mitahara emphasises that right quality and quantity of food should be eaten in a positive state of mind. Activity 8.2 In Column I, put a list of food items that you like eating and in Column II put the food items that you consider good for your health. Column I Food items that you like eating Column II Food items that you consider good for health Questions • • Compare the items of both the columns. Do the items in Column I tally with those in Column II? • • Do you think that you need to change your food habits? Make a separate list indicating which food items from the list (Column I) you want to change. Vihara Vihara means relaxation, which can be brought about by activities, such as, exercise, recreational and creative activities like drawing, painting, singing, etc. These activities help to regulate and channelise our emotions and bring us joy and happiness. Yogic practices of asana, pranayama and meditation relax body and mind. In addition to this, relaxation can be attained in good company also. Sound sleep is also important for relaxation. It is, therefore, important that we should regularly follow a timetable that provides adequate time for yogic and creative activities which are relaxing.

{"id": "class 9__phe__p149__c1", "text": "Yoga for Healthy Living 137 Achara Achara means conduct that includes emotions, attitudes, desires, instincts and habits. Right conduct is essential for a stress-free life. Positive emotions and positive attitudes, good habits and control on desires help in making us strong, both, individually and socially. The right conduct protects us from unnecessary stress caused by negative emotions and attitudes like hate, jealousy, fear, etc. Therefore, we should have control on our desires, instincts, emotions, habits and attitudes. Here, yoga is important as it encourages good conduct in our personal and social life. Yoga advocates for positive emotions and positive attitude towards self and other persons. In this context yogic principles of Yama (restraint) and Niyama (observance) help to develop control on our desires and emotions and bring about peace and harmony. Yama (Restraint) and Niyama (Observance) Yamas (restraints) and Niyamas (observances) are sets of the dos and the don’ts. They can be considered as the universal codes of conduct that help us in following high standards in our personal and social life. Yamas are concerned with one’s social life; while the niyamas are concerned with one’s personal life. Yama and Niyama are part of Ashtanga Yoga that has been propagated by Patanjali. The five yamas are ahimsa (non-violence), satya (truthfulness), asteya (non stealing), brahmcharya (celibacy) and aparigraha (non possessiveness). The five niyamas are: Shaucha (cleanliness), Santosha (contentment), Tapas (austerity), Swadhyaya (self study) and Ishwarpranidhana (surrender to god). Vichara We know that thoughts are very important as our behaviour is guided by the kind of thoughts we have. Our thinking should be positive. Positive thoughts bring pleasure to our life; while negative thoughts can make us unhappy. Right thinking guides us towards appropriate behaviour. It helps in prevention and management of stress-related health problems. Yoga prescribes that one should have positive thoughts. Positive thoughts give us strength to bear the sorrows of life. Yogic practices like yama, niyama, pratyahara, dhyana (meditation), study of good literature, etc., help us in controlling our thoughts and thereby promoting optimism in life. Activity 8.4 Ramesh and his friends are planning to skip their classes and go for a movie instead. Ramesh is worried as he feels that it is not right to skip the class without informing his parents. But at the same time, he does not want to be seen as a spoilsport by his friends. Finally, he succumbed to the peer pressure. Now, he is disturbed to think what would happen if his parents come to know of it. Questions •• Why was Ramesh worried? •• Was his conduct appropriate? Explain your answer. •• Can you suggest some ways to get out of this conflicting situation? •• What would you do, if you were in Ramesh’s place? •• Do you think the yogic principles of Yama (restraint) and Niyama (observance) help to develop control on our desires and emotions and lessen our stress?

We should not indulge in wrong activities. Our behaviour towards others should be appropriate. Karma‑ yoga proposes that we should perform right and act with full dedication and to our utmost capacity without worrying about the results. We can remain stress-free and be happy if we follow this philosophy and act accordingly.

To achieve optimal level of fitness certain dietary considerations are required. Mostly food is consumed for its taste or appearance; however, both nutritive value and quality of food need attention. Food quality, food adulteration, food spoilage and impact of indiscriminate use of pesticide and radiation on human health have been discussed in this lesson. Dietary Planning Dietary planning is an important step in proper food selection and preparation of meal to stay healthy and fit. Dietary planning is a process of developing meal plans for adequate nutrition within the available resources. Nutritional requirement and food choices vary with regard to their age, sex, activity level and physiological condition. Food is planned accordingly to make it enjoyable, satisfying and healthy. Planning is a scientific method of saving energy, time and money. It makes the tasks of procuring raw material, preparing meals and ensuring food quality simpler. It adds variety the meals and reduces wastage. You have studied the five food groups in Class IX. Revise these and for reference keep these handy. Factors Affecting the Planning Everybody needs a balanced diet irrespective of age but certain factors influence the food choices. Consider the following factors while planning meal for good health and fitness. Age Body’s need for food and nutrients varies greatly with age. An infant needs only mother’s milk initially but needs extra Dietary Considerations and Food Quality 9 Activity 9.1 •• Plan a meal (lunch or dinner) including some food from each food group. •• Record your one day diet.

Adolescents grow at a fast pace and are active, so they need extra nourishment. But their food preferences are often influenced by friends and media rather than nutritional requirement. They need guidance in this regard. Nutritious food preparations can be planned in the form they enjoy, like spinach paratha or spinach, carrot and potato soup instead of spinach vegetable. Elders often have difficulty in chewing, swallowing and digestion; they need soft and easily digestible foods, such as, well cooked vegetables, idli etc. Gender Nutritional requirements vary with gender. Till the age of 10 years nutritional requirements are same, thereafter both grow at different pace and their body composition is also different. Mostly men are taller and heavier than women. They are more muscular while women have more fat cells. Thus, their body types are different leading to different nutrient requirements. Females need more iron (hemoglobin) due to blood loss during menstruation. Lack of iron often puts them at high risk of iron deficiency or anemia. Whole grains, seasonal fruits, green leafy vegetables and dairy products are healthy for both genders. Food preferences may also vary with gender. Physical activity Energy and nutrient requirements vary with physical activity. Sitting jobs like reading, computer work, etc., need less energy and heavy duty tasks like cycling, carrying heavy load, sports, etc., need more energy. Intensity and duration of activity also affect the requirements, e.g., a person cycling normally needs lesser energy than a person participating in a race, need nutrients, like vitamin B, in accordance with energy requirement. In general energy from fried foods, extra butter or ghee needs to be avoided. Food preparations from whole foods, nuts, oilseeds, dairy foods, egg, and fish can fulfill the requirement for energy and other nutrients. Physiological state Physiological conditions like infancy, childhood, adolescence, pregnancy, lactation impose high demands of food and nutrients due to higher rate of growth and development. For example, a healthy sedentary woman needs 1900 kcal/day while the same woman, if pregnant, will need 2200 kcal. Similarly an adult man needs 0.8 g protein/Kg body weight/day. The same person if an athlete requires 2.0g protein/Kg body weight/day.

Economic considerations Some foods are expensive while others are cheap but both may provide similar nutritional benefits, e.g., cashew nuts are expensive, groundnuts are cheap and both are good sources of fat, protein, vitamins and minerals. Seasonal, local, fresh foods are cheaper and more nutritious. The cost of a food item also varies from one place to another. Purchasing from whole sale markets, haats, etc., is economical. Homemade food is cheaper. Time and skill The number and types of dishes served in a meal depend on the availability of time, ingredients, equipment and skills of the person who cooks. Lack of these may influence the quality of the meal. Hence, it is necessary to plan in such a way that nutritional quality is maintained. Preplanning and time management skills are useful in preparing nutritious meal in lesser time. All members of the family, including children, need to be engaged in food preparation activities in an appropriate manner. Region, religion and culture Eating habits are often linked with the foods produced in the localily, e.g., people living in coastal areas eat more fish or coconut is popular in Kerala. When the same food is consumed over a period of time it becomes cultural practice. Religion also influences the food habits e.g., the Jain community does not eat onion, garlic, eggs, fish, meat, etc., However, mobility, technology and various modern factors are lessening such impacts. Certain foods are associated with festivals like, gujia in Holi. Food preferences of individuals Food preferences vary from person to person and strongly affect planning of meals, e.g., a vegetarian cannot eat meat and a non-vegetarian will not get satisfaction with only vegetarian dishes. People from south India will get satisfaction with idli sambhar instead of dal roti. Occasional change is accepted but dissatisfaction resulted from less preferred food over a long period of time may lead to under-eating, malnutrition and health problems.

There are four tastes, i.e., sweet, salt, bitter, sour. The fifth taste is referred to as umami which is similar to the taste of monosodium glutamate (MSG). Ayurveda describes six tastes namely, sweet, salt, bitter, sour, pungent and astringent which can easily be linked with the tastes of sugar, salt, neem, lemon, chilli and amla respectively.

Specific compounds when present in a certain food give them distinct flavor and can also be modified by processing. Satiety value Satiety value implies a sense of pleasure and satisfaction that a person gets from eating food. While planning meals, it is important to take care that it keeps one satisfied for sufficient time and does not lead to hunger pangs soon. This in turn will affect the working capacity, efficiency and health of a person. Media and advertisement Many persons, particularly children, choose food tempted by advertisements. Further they choose a certain food because it is available on discount or as a free gift. Such practice is common with some processed, packaged and ready to eat foods. These items may initially attract, appear cheap but on regular use they may turn out to be costly, less nutritious and unhealthy. Hence it is necessary to see nutrition facts on the label of the packing to make healthy food choices. Using the same concept to advertise nutritious foods will encourage people to choose and consume healthy diets. Accessibility and transport Foods available nearby are usually selected. It commonly happens with people living in remote areas, elders, handicaps and persons not having requisite transport facilities. Famines, droughts, heavy rainfall, cyclones and road blockages further limit the food supply. Big bazaars, home delivery system and online purchase have improved the access to food. Local haats are organised which are also good sources of cheap and fresh food items.

They are constantly indulged in intense physical exercises, training, matches and competitions and other sports-related activities. Hence their energy and nutritional requirements are also very high. Besides age, gender, body composition, types of sports, intensity and duration of the event, the environmental factors also greatly affect their nutritional requirements. Adequate nutrition is of utmost importance for their health, physical fitness, endurance, peak performance and prevention of dehydration, injury and infection. The right kind of food given at the right time in right proportion is of paramount importance for sportpersons to prolong their sporting life. Carbohydrates Carbohydrates are major sources of energy for sportpersons. For general fitness, 3-5 g carbohydrate per Kg body weight per day is sufficient. For intensive sport like football, gymnastic, weight lifting, 5-10 g carbohydrate per Kg body weight per day may be required. Body stores of carbohydrate (glycogen) must be sufficient before and during exercise. Glycogen stores determine the stamina and performance. For one hour of exercise, no extra intake except water is needed. Carbohydrate requirement increases with increasing duration of workout. Timing of carbohydrates intake is vital. Intake of high carbohydrate, easily digestible food, 2-4 hours before training and event are advisable for quick energy release and replenishment in the body. Food preparations having potato (baked), bread, rice, semolina (suji), and banana along with liquid food are suggested. Excessive consumption of carbohydrates may lead to weight gain, cause digestive discomfort, muscle stiffness, diarrhea, lethargy, etc., and eventually hamper the performance. Protein Depending upon the intensity of the sport, protein requirement can range from 1.2 -2.0g per kg body weight per day. Sufficient intake of carbohydrates ensures that protein is used for building and repairing of muscles and tissues; for formation of hormones, enzymes, antibodies and neurotransmitters; preventing damage; and not for giving energy. For better utilisation of protein, consume carbohydrate and protein food sources in appropriate proportion, preferably 3:1 or 4:1 for better performance in endurance events. Foods like egg, whey protein, soy and milk (casein), low fat dairy products, grains, nuts, seeds and beans provide good quality protein. Readymade protein powders should be avoided or taken under expert supervision only. Low protein intake makes sportpersons susceptible to fatigue, Activity 9.3 •• Make a diet plan for your team participating in football in Meghalaya, giving suitable justifications. •• Your physical education teacher must be planning events for sports day.

At the same time high protein intake particularly from animal foods or protein powders or supplements may cause unnecessary weight gain, calcium excretion in urine and adverse effect on bones, liver and kidney functions. Consumption of more protein is advisable after the event, during rest period for repair and recovery of the body. Fat Fat is not considered a good source of energy during exercise and competition. It is metabolised very slowly, thus, is better for slow and long duration events like marathon. Fats like butter, cream, cow’s ghee or coconut oil are good for synthesis of hormone necessary to maintain stamina in sport. Nuts, seeds, low fat dairy products are good choices as they also provide other nutrients and antioxidants. Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids like flax seeds, fish oil, salmon, consumed in the right amount, enhance strength and vigour in the body and accelerate performance. However, high intake of fat eventually leads to overweight, obesity and associated health problems which hamper performance significantly. Vitamins and minerals Vitamins and minerals are crucial in sport because energy utilisation in the body is largely associated with them, particularly some group B vitamins and magnesium. Folate, calcium, zinc, iron are other crucial micronutrients which get depleted faster during long exercises. Vitamin C plays an important role in collagen synthesis and absorption and utilisation of iron in the body. Vitamin B6 helps in protein utilisation. Vitamin A, E and C are important to prevent cell damage and act as antioxidants which are needed to reduce stress and improve stamina and immunity. Adequate intake of these supports the performance and recovery from injury in sport. Colorful fruits and vegetables, dairy products, seeds, nuts and whole grains taken in sufficient amount can provide the needed vitamins and minerals. Water and fluids Water and fluids maintain the hydration level and electrolyte balance in the body and are crucial in sports. Dehydration can be serious and can lead to heat exhaustion, profuse sweating, muscle cramps, vertigo (fainting), vomiting, constipation, excessive fatigue and disturbance in vision and coordination. It can hamper the performance and reduce endurance significantly. Drinking 2-2.5 liters of water may be adequate but up to 5-6 liters a day in hot weather and intense exercises may be needed. Sometimes just potable water is not sufficient addition of glucose and salt is also needed. Reprint 2025-26"}

Sports Authority of India along with some other reputed institutions has suggested the nutritional guidelines for different sport. Find out about them. Food Quality Nutritious food too, if contaminated or adulterated is not safe for consumption as it may cause infection or disease. Hence the causes of food spoilage, and the ways to improve the food quality need to be understood. Food quality is the criteria by which a person accepts or rejects any food item. It is crucial at every stage of food handling from farm to table. Good quality food brings health and well-being and poor quality can cause illness and rejection of food in the market as well. Quality of food is often judged in terms of microbiological load and alterations in physical parameters and chemical composition of food. Food quality risks include food adulteration. In order to protect the health of the people every government enforces certain laws and regulations. In India it is the responsibility of Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) to ensure safety and quality food. Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is a statuary body under Food Safety and Standards Act 2006. It now encompasses previously employed eight acts in the interest of food operators and consumers. It ensures the availability of wholesome food that is safe for consumption. Amendment and up-gradation are done from time to time. FSSAI code is given to each food item which you can see on various food products. Physical examination of food is done on the basis of size, shape, color, texture and visual appeal. The food should be free from dirt, cracks or any foreign material; contamination by bacteria, mould, virus, yeast; and infestation by insects, pests, rats, mice, flies and cockroaches which lead to food spoilage and make the food unfit for human consumption. Food quality can seriously be influenced by factors like heat (temperature); air (oxygen, humidity) or moisture content of food, type of food itself and its composition, treatment given to food during processing, handling and storage. Food quality is favorably altered by techniques of food preservation. It is also possible to enhance nutritional quality of food by fortification. Activity 9.4 •• Visit to nearby market, select any 10 food items and report food quality based on the check points above. •• Collect 10 packaged foods and record five points reflecting the food quality in each. •• If you have found low quality food then what you would do?

When food quality is modified intentionally, it is called food adulteration. Over ripening or excessive microbial load causes food spoilage. All these aspects are discussed briefly in the following section. Check points to ensure food quality •• Check for cuts, bruises, foul smell, discoloration and wrinkles on fruits and vegetables before purchase, handling and consumption. •• Check for any foreign material or adulterant in food. •• Check for seal of the packet or lid of the container or bulging of container. •• Read label for safety, permitted color, preservatives, in- gredients, specific information, direction of use, FSSAI code, manufacturing and expiry or “best before” date. •• Avoid buying loose food items particularly flours, oil, spice powders, etc. •• Be watchful for harmful chemicals and colors used to give product a certain look, e.g., acid washed ginger and colored sweets. Food spoilage Food spoilage indicates that the food is unfit for human consumption. It is a serious threat to food quality and can be fatal. It is mainly caused by microorganisms, over activity of some enzymes and insects, pests and rodents. High moisture content, temperature and nutrient composition of food affects the growth of causative factors and accelerate food spoilage. The knowledge of approximate shelf life of different foods helps in reducing spoilage. The duration of time during which the food item remains fit for consumption at room temperature is called shelf life which determines perishability. Thus, foods are — 1. Perishable which remain fresh and edible for few hours to 1-2 days only, e.g., milk, meat, green leafy vegetables. 2. Semi-perishable which remain fresh and edible for about a week (5-7 days) e.g., some vegetables and fruits. 3. Non-perishable which remain fresh and edible for more than a month, e.g., grains, sugar, oil, pulses. Food is precious and is not available in unlimited quantity. So food should not be wasted rather protected from spoilage. Proper storage of food decreases food spoilage and various Fig. 9.5: ISI Activity 9.5 •• Collect five perishable food items and leave them at room temperature.

Food preservation Food preservation is the process of treating and handling food to stop or slow down spoilage and extend shelf life of food. It works on the principles of reducing the moisture content, preventing the growth of micro organisms causing spoilage and controlling enzymatic activity. The techniques are — 1. Heat treatment: Application of heat helps in preserving food by destroying the harmful microorganisms. For example, Pasteurisation of milk and sterilisation of bottles. 2. Refrigeration and freezing: Low temperature limit the enzymatic and microbial activities keeping the food safe for longer duration. 3. Drying or dehydration: This technique is based on reducing or removing the moisture content of food as microbes cannot grow in the absence of water. 4. Addition of preservatives: Preservatives are natural or chemical ingredients which selectively control the growth of microorganisms and enzymes in food and restrict spoilage. Jams and jellies are preserved by sugar and pickles by salt, spices and oil. Acid medium also restrict the growth of bacteria. Chemical preservatives like sodium benzoate or Potassium Meta bisulphite (KMS) are used in ketchups and squashes. Preservatives are used in very small quantity. Use above the prescribed limit is harmful and punishable under law. 5. Preservation by Radiation: Radiations are emissions of intense energy capable of penetrating tissues. When food is exposed to specific form of radiation (gamma rays from Cobalt 60) under controlled conditions it increases their shelf life and is referred as irradiated food. Items like fruits, potatoes, onions, spices, herbs and some ready-to-eat foods can be preserved in this way. But this technique is not suitable for milk and milk products. The safety of irradiated foods is under debate. Consumers can choose or avoid irradiated foods by identifying its symbol on the label. This mark has been approved by Food safety and Standards Regulations Authority of India (2015).

Effects of pesticides on health Pesticides are chemicals used in agriculture to protect crops in the fields, during storage and to control insects and pests in the surroundings, e.g., mosquitoes and cockroaches. These can be chemical or biological in nature. Chemical pesticides have played a significant role in increasing food production, but unnecessary and excessive use of these over a long period of time has adversely influenced various forms of life on earth, as well as, the quality of soil, water and environment. These have disrupted the natural balance of the ecosystem. Pesticides often leave their residues in food which are passed on to the body. Those at higher risks are workers handling or producing pesticides as pesticides are toxic in nature. The adverse effects of pesticide residues depend on the type and amount of the pesticide and the route (ingestion or inhalation) and duration of exposure. If pesticide is used in accordance with good agricultural practice, the residual level would be low and consumption of such foods will not be harmful. Symptoms of acute poisoning include vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dizziness and numbness. In severe cases, it may lead to difficulties in breathing, blurred vision and convulsion. Pesticides can cause damage to the brain and nervous system, liver, kidneys and are specially harmful to fetus. In India, FSSAI is responsible for setting maximum residue limits (MRLs) for the pesticides.

Many substances have been used as medicines since ages in one or the other form, but modern times have seen a tremendous growth in terms of types and usage of medicines. While medicines are used to treat diseases and can be life saving, they can harm the body if not used correctly. Medicines are used in the form of injections, tablets, syrups, creams, lotions, solutions, drops, powder, sprays and straps. Medicines affect us in many ways. Some of the common ways are — •• Analgesics — reducing pain and in fever. •• Antibodies — killing or weakening microbes and infections. •• Lotions — in burns and allergies, for soothing effect. •• Supplements — correcting deficiencies due to vitamins, nutrients. •• Antipsychotic drugs — modifying the body’s response, psychological disorders. •• Vaccines and inoculations and immunisation — Protecting and preventing. •• Hormones — supporting physiological functions. •• Herbal medicines — plants herbs Although medicines assist us to lead a healthy life free of diseases, there are also certain undesirable effects due to Do You Know? 30 compressions followed by two breaths counts consists of one cycle of CPR.

Precautions while taking medicines Medicines need to be used in the required dose so that they should not only have the desired effect but also prevent undesired side effects. Some of the precautions while taking medicines are — •• Take medicines only if prescribed by a doctor. Self medication may be dangerous. •• Take the recommended dose of the medicine and at the prescribed interval. Only then there will be desired effects. One should never adjust the dose oneself. •• Do not minimise or exceed the dose and frequency of taking the medicine. This can cause undesirable effects •• Adult dose of medicines should not be given to children. There are special forms and doses of medicines for children. Keep all medicines out of reach of children. Ingestion by them may cause emergency. •• Store the medicines away from extreme temperature and sunlight. •• Always check the expiry date of medicines before consumption. •• Use a full cup of water and drink standing upright while swallowing a tablet. •• Do not take any medicine on an empty stomach unless prescribed by the doctor. •• Keep a list of medicines one is allergic to.

Also they are more amenable to external influences, such as, the media and peers. This makes them more vulnerable to substance misuse, especially when they do not have correct and scientific information. They also lack life skills to deal with the wide ranging negative outcomes of extreme dependency on a substance and thereby, getting addicted to it. Do You Know?

As you have learnt, drugs affect the body by changing the mental and physical status of a person. Some other substances also work in the same way and are not necessarily drugs. The non-medical use of a substance including drugs, that changes an individual’s mental and physical status and affect the health adversely, is known as substance abuse. Once a person starts using a substance, his mental state is altered and the person cannot get out of this habit. The extreme dependency on the substance compels them to increase the intake every day. This is called addiction. Substance misuse is widespread today including adolescents across the world. Socially acceptable drugs like tobacco and alcohol abuse not only ruins the life of the individual but can also influence them to associated with crime and violence. Commonly abused substances There are substances that can be abused for their mood- altering effects such as inhalants and solvents. On the other hand, there are drugs that can be abused that have no mood- altering or intoxication properties, such as, anabolic steroids. They are abused by the adolescents and youth during body building, to look more muscular. Commonly abused substances are tobacco, alcohol, marijuana (ganja), opium, cannabis, solvents (petrol, glue, correction ink) and aerosols inhalants, cough syrup, caffeine, cocaine and ecstasy. There are other substances like gutka and paan (betel). These substances can be ingested, inhaled, drunk, chewed or injected by a syringe in the blood. Some of these substances make one addicted, even if taken once. Reasons for substance abuse in young people Young people are more vulnerable to substance abuse due to the following reasons — •• During the process of growing up, poor self-esteem, low achievement at school, performance pressures, etc,. are some of the factors that promote substance abuse in adolescence. Resorting to substance use as a means of ‘growing up’ or fun also makes the adolescents more vulnerable to substance abuse. •• Pressure from peers or friends to try an addictive substance, the urge to gain popularity among friends, and desire to experiment and curiosity to try out new things also make young people particularly vulnerable to substance abuse.

CASE 1 Sohan has performed well in Class IX annual exams. Now, he is worried whether he will be able to keep up his performance and score good grades in Class X. His parents always tell him how they expect to see him at the top of his class. Afraid of disappointing them, Sohan does not share his concerns with his parents. He feels that some of his friends may be going through the same phase and discusses his problem with them. His friends suggest that smoking may reduce his stress and help him to relax. Sohan wants to feel better and decides to follow his friends’ advice. He starts smoking a cigarette or two everyday. Without realising, over a period of six months he was smoking 6-10 cigarettes a day. Smoking has become a habit with him, and in future, it was the cause of his ill health. Points for Discussion a) What do you think is responsible for Sohan’s habit of smoking and why? b) Do you think smoking helped reduce Sohan’s stress? Why? c) What else could Sohan have done to reduce his stress effectively? d) What role could Sohan’s parents have played to prevent him from smoking? Consequences of substance abuse Substance misuse leads to a number of short-term and long- term effects that are detrimental to health. Short-term effects: These are effects that appear only a few minutes after the intake of substance. The user feels a false sense of well-being and a pleasant drowsiness. Some of the short-term effects are distorted vision, hearing and coordination, impaired judgment, bad breath and hangovers. Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 9__phe__p202__c1", "text": "Health and Physical Education - Class X 190 Long-term effects: Substances having a long-term impact lead to serious damage due to constant and excessive use. These effects show up over a course of time and are usually caused by progressive damage to different body organs. Some of the health consequences include irregular eating habits, sleep disorders, poor hygiene resulting in poor health and low immunity. This predisposes substance abuser to diseases and infections. Substance abuse in itself is not a cause of HIV/AIDS or STDs but under the influence of drugs, people may engage in risk-behaviours that make them more susceptible to these infections. Injectable drug users, however, are more prone to HIV in conditions where the users do not sterilise needles and share needles to inject the drug. Substance users may even die suddenly from a so-called overdose, when one consumes more than what the body can tolerate. Death may also occur from long-term damage to the organs of the body. These substances are especially harmful if consumed during pregnancy. These substances reach the foetus through blood and harm it by crippling its growth and development or death. Substance abuse influences not only the individual and family but also the community. The persons who get addicted often lose interest in other activities be it school, job or any other responsibility. They are not able to take care of their responsibilities and may become a liability for their families and finally the society. Furthermore, it is expensive to buy substances or drugs on a regular basis. Hence, in desperation, addicted individuals may be forced to engage in petty severe crimes. Prevention of drug abuse Paying attention to the following may prevent young people from misusing substances — •• Peer pressure can be managed by being aware of the implications of substance abuse and developing life skills. One can not only save oneself from adopting risky behaviours under peer pressure but also persuade the peers not to engage in unhealthy behaviours such as substance misuse. Advocacy with the involvement of local community can be quite useful. • • The different ways of dealing with negative peer pressure are saying ‘No’ assertively, making an excuse, reversal of pressure, and giving reasons. • • Young people should also be educated to recognise that a friend is someone who cares, protects and looks Activity 10.6 Discuss how a substance abuser’s life gets affected.

They should be taking well-informed and responsible decisions. • • The family and society should provide the support system for young children in their ‘low’ times. • • As the attitudes related to smoking, drinking and misuse of other substances are formed during pre-adolescence and early adolescence, this is an important age to invest in prevention efforts. The family, community and educational institutions should empower young people with correct and scientific information. Young children should be encouraged to get engaged in socially productive activities. For example, one can start a learning centre for the lesser advantaged children in the neighbourhood, one can learn Braille and help at blind school, and one can create awareness about water conservation in the neighbourhood.

Our socio-economic needs are such that people depend upon each other as we cannot live in isolation. We live together and collectively share certain amenities that are necessary for our day-to-day existence. In the previous classes (Class VII to IX), we read about the negative effects of unhygienic or filthy surroundings on our health. Regular access to basic amenities, such as, clean water, sanitation, garbage disposal facilities, health care services, recreational facilities, etc., are important for prevention of illnesses and diseases. For prevention of diseases like coronavirus, maintaining of social distance is very important. In this chapter, the essential features of healthy community living including social distancing during coronavirus will be discussed. The focus will also be on the principles of cooperative living to ensure healthy living conditions for one and all. Healthy Community Living Our way of life, and the utilisation of resources, decide the quality of our personal and community life. A healthy way of living in the community is ensured not only by the optimal use of resources but also by keeping our environment clean and hygienic. Let us understand what is meant by healthy community living. The following figures show community life in three different situations — 1. A village (Fig 11.1) 2.

Most of the houses in this village are beautifully decorated with flowers and plants. As per the Census of 2011, the total population of Mawlynnong is 414. The main occupation of the villagers is agriculture, but it has also been an age old tradition of ensuring that the surrounding environment is clean. In fact cleanliness is a collective effort and this practice is ingrained in the people since their childhood. The people voluntarily sweep the roads and lanes, water the plants in public areas and clean the drains. A dustbin made out of bamboo is found all along the village. Everyone makes it a point that dirt and waste are not thrown anywhere. All the waste from the dustbin is collected and kept in a pit, which the villagers use as manure. Trees are planted to restore and maintain nature’s balance. Mawlynnong’s fame as the cleanest village in Asia, is drawing a lot of domestic as well as international tourists, as a result of which tourism is also an important source of employment for the local youths. Besides, there are many interesting sights to see such as the famous living root bridge in the nearby village of Riwai, which is a fascinating example of indigenous methods of conservation and sustainability. Local youths are available as enthusiastic and informative guides. Fig. 11.1: Mawlynnong Village A township in an urban area Fig. 11.2: A modern township Reprint 2025-26"}

Through these activities, you may have observed that in a community, a group of people live in a particular local area. Secondly, they share common facilities, which differ from place to place. In some areas, people have access to facilities, such as, water supply, sanitation, garbage disposal facilities, health care services, recreational facilities, community centre, schools, transportation, etc., but in some places people do not have access to even the most basic amenities. A community is said to be healthy when its members continuously work together to maintain, improve and expand the available natural resources and avoid their wastage. The healthy community only be develped when its members recognise their roles and responsibilities. They strive to inculcate values and attitudes of cooperation, mutual respect, tolerance, kindness, etc. The role of Panchayati Raj, civil societies and other government institutions is also very important to promote healthy living. Important features of healthy community living Maintaining cleanliness of our home and surroundings is an essential feature of healthy community living. Healthy community is one in which all residents have access to quality education, safe and healthy homes, adequate employment, transportation, physical activity and nutrition. Living in overcrowded and unhygienic places with excessive noise and pollution, may lead to various forms of illnesses, diseases and stress. For instance, lack of adequate space, poor ventilation in rooms and toxic fumes in the air, increase the risk of air borne diseases. Access to basic amenities such as regular water supply, safe drinking water and sanitation, is important for healthy community living. In the previous classes (Classes VII to IX), it has been learnt that open and unattended garbage dumps are a potential breeding place for flies, cockroaches, insects and so on. Stagnant water and open drains breed mosquitoes, the carrier of diseases, such as, malaria, dengue and chikungunya. Water borne diseases, such as, cholera, jaundice, diarrhea and gastroenteritis are also resulted due to water pollution. Access to basic amenities also includes other provisions such as electricity, hospitals, dispensaries, housing facilities, roads and transportation, schools, colleges, employment, security, recreational facilities and so on.

{"id": "class 9__phe__p209__c1", "text": "Healthy Community Living 197 To ensure these basic amenities, the role of the local government or panchayats is very important. They are required to ensure rules and regulations for safety measures, cleanliness, ensure equal access of public amenities to all members, promote adoption of waste management practices, and help ecological restoration and conservation. However, we cannot depend solely on the government to take the initiative. The quality of life in a community also depends on how the members of the community work to improve on available resources and ensure that the government provides for these facilities. You might have seen this logo before. This is the logo of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. You must have also seen some of the television advertisements through which the government advertises the importance and necessity of staying clean and keeping our environment clean. In this Clean India campaign — known popularly as the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the vision of a Clean and hygienic India, once seen by Mahatma Gandhi, can happen only if members of every community cooperate and accept individual and collective responsibility of keeping themselves, their homes and their surroundings clean. In order to work collectively, members of a community need to develop values of co-operation, kindness, respect, gratitude, joy, peace and selflessness. These attributes are important in fostering the principles of collective work and in nurturing healthy social relationships. The example of Mawlynnong village shows that high income alone is not the only criterion for healthy living. Cooperative action, responsibility and positive values can also help in improving the quality of life, and healthy living conditions for one and all.

Common camping sites are: visits to villages or rural areas to understand their pattern of living; mountain areas, national parks, lakes, beaches, forests, etc. One can also plan camping activities in a nearby place, such as, open fields, park, or even in an open space of the school premises.

Importance of camping Camping gives students a good break, away from the monotony of the classroom. It gives an opportunity to learn from nature in a joyful, exciting and adventurous manner. Living in the natural environment with students from different areas, cultures, religions and backgrounds, help then to learn to work as a team in various activities. These activities differ from adventurous and challenging ones, to the most basic ones, such as, cooking, cleaning, collecting water, etc. In this process, students learn the importance of self-reliance, teamwork, co-existence, importance of natural resources and organisational skills.

Humans too are social animals and much of their behaviour is based on social norms laid down by the human societies since time immemorial. Therefore, social health is a very important issue for all human beings — men-women, young-old, educated- uneducated, rich-poor. Those children who learn to become socially healthy remain so all their lives. This chapter, will deal with the ways and means of growing up as socially healthy individuals and also helping them to clarify myths related to coronavirus. Myths and facts related to coronavirus Statement: A person with coronavirus can recover fully and not be infectious any longer. Fact: 80 per cent of the people have recovered from the disease without needing special treatment. But information on the virus treatment is still being researched. Statement: Eating raw garlic, sesame seeds will protect you against the virus. Fact: Garlic is a healthy food that has other benefits but does not protect you against the coronavirus. Statement: The virus can die easily once it is out of the body. Fact: We do not know about this particular virus as of now. Similar viruses (SARS, MERS) survive from 8 to 24 hours depending on types of surfaces. Statement: You can get COVID-19 through mosquito bites Fact: The coronavirus cannot be spread through the bite of a mosquito.

Ravi : I am fine but my grandfather always feels angry and unhappy. He criticises everyone all the time, so no one wants to sit and talk with him. He is boring and not as loving as you are. Why does he behave like that Dadu? Mr. Das : It is because he has been unwell for a long time. Your grandpa is not getting company from any one, this makes him feel lonely and isolated. In other words, he is suffering physically, as well as mentally due to his old age. He gets angry because he is unsure of himself now and annoys others by his comments. He does not think that he is acceptable in society now. Which is why, he expresses his frustrations by being rude to others without any reason and fault of theirs. Why don’t you spend time with him? Talk to him about your friends, your day in school, a happy incident, a sad one also and you may observe the change in him within a few days. Ravi : Thank you, Dadu. Now I understand that if someone is sick and emotionally unhappy, he would likely be angry and alienate others. Answer in brief 1. Give reasons for the loneliness of Ravi’s grandfather. 2.

Would you agree that the country’s constitution provides for Justice, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity which should be adopted in life for living happily and having consideration for all others in the group? Let us understand these four terms of our constitution which are directly related to “social health of a person or a country”, and then try to define social health. In other words, if one is socially healthy, than will be able to develop interpersonal relations, through maintaining equality, fraternity and justice. Let us now try and define social health. Definition of ‘Social Health’ Social health may be defined as the ability to form satisfying interpersonal relationships with others. One who is able to make positive relationships and acquires the ability to adapt in different social situations and act appropriately as per the situation concerned, and can be called a socially healthy person. Need for developing social health Primitive humans were hunter-gatherers, who lived in small groups or clusters and spent their lives at individual levels. Around 10,000 years ago, they moved near rivers to grow their own food and began to live together. With the passage of time, they started to live in a society and developed a language for interaction with each other. As ‘human society’ progressed, an individual became part of many social groups for example a member of a peer group, a family and kin, a class in school, a native of a region and a citizen of one’s country. Social changes occur from time to time and many societies lay down norms and values for group living. Urbanisation has brought about many changes which are different from traditional rural societies. Social attributes, of people however, remain the same as they are based on interrelationship between members of any society and necessary for accomplishing tasks requiring teamwork. School is one of the platforms for learning social skills. Role of various Institutions Promotion of social health among children requires collective efforts and appropriate skills. All people in the field of education have to think about this. Reprint 2025-26"}

There are a number of organisation concerned with school education. The syllabus of teacher training courses should include the topics of important issues for children of which health should be one. Organisations such as NCERT, SCERT, DIET should periodically organise workshops, publish journals and provide inservice training programmes on health issues including social health. Role of schools in promoting social health Schools have a very significant role to play in the promotion of health and safety of children. They spend a lot of time in school in early years. School environment forms ideal setting for acquiring knowledge of healthy choices of food. It is in school that they participate in physical activity through sports, games, yoga, gymnastics, exercise and gain benefits of each. School helps children to learn social skills which assist in establishing lifelong healthy behavior. Children learn team spirit and training in rules and regulations of social wellbeing just as in the defense services, which are inbuilt in training of defense service personnel, so they work together as a team to protect our nation. In order to promote social health, the school should have a positive environment where children mingle with teachers, peer group and non-teaching staff without fear and apprehensions. Teacher have a significant role in this regard. Role of teachers It is well known that teachers are the mentors and therefore, the teacher training institutes should make training in leadership and mentorship a part of teacher training. Also well known saying that ‘example in better than precept’ Students easily learn to be socially healthy if the teacher herself or himself sets an example rather than lecture on social health. A good teacher ensures that students grow up into physically, mentally and socially healthy individuals. In doing this the teacher has to make efforts to ensure that students — (i) eat a proper diet and perform regular exercise and physical activity which are requirements of good physical health. (ii) inculcate friendship between classmates, indulge in amicable behavior with others in school so that students develop a helpful nature. These are necessary for mental and emotional health.

Teachers should train students in learning life skills like — a) empathy and self awareness b) effective communication so that they develop healthy Interpersonal relationships c) problem-solving and decision-making to learn to be stress free d) creative and critical thinking e) coping with stress and emotion. The above are absolutely essential for developing social skills in order to be socially healthy. Social skills help a student to have a desirable self image and self esteem and also self confidence. This makes children acquire ability to live harmoniously in the society. Role of technology in building social health Technology has made communication convenient through Mobiles, Skype, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and E-mail messages. Knowledge about different media can help to develop the skills to access the appropriate media for accurate information on a specific topic or issues. More so, because media brings awareness, and provides access to global knowledge and learning. But refrain from using mobiles and viewing the T.V. for long periods as that tends to be counter-productive and reduce interaction time with others. This makes us socially withdrawn. Although media is a source of information, all of it may not be true or reliable. It is advisable to seek guidenes from a trusted adult while accessing media and internet. Moreover, there is a need to understand about real and fake news or information as these affects our attitude and behavior. Role of students in building habits of social health Social health comes from social skills. A few important guidelines for promoting social skills are outlined below. (i) Building self awareness is an important skill: Practice self-care by developing habits of cleanliness and hygiene, keeping away from substance abuse, engaging in physical activity and regularly consuming a balanced diet. (ii) Do not be blameful and judgmental: Remember when you point a finger at others, three fingers of yours point towards you. Hence indulge in knowing yourself better. It helps to discriminate between a good and a bad act of yours and helps to make friends. Empathy and self awareness go hand in hand.

(iii) Learn to identify your own mistakes: There is no harm in saying sorry for a mistake and rectifying it. People will have faith in you if you did so. (iv) Make an effort to reconnect with old relationships and friendships: The socially healthy person makes an effort to contact and meet old friends, to remember enjoyable periods of childhood which can be a good way to beat stress and spend leisure time. (v) Appreciate yourself and others: But never let your ego rule your behaviour which can sometimes drive you to lose a relationship. (vi) Try and be respectful, positive and supportive towards the needy, the physically and mentally challenged, the downtrodden and those belonging to faith and cultures other than yours. Lend an ear to others opinion. It teaches tolerance. Tolerance and appreciation are virtues in socially healthy individuals. Role of family in inculcating social skills in young family members The importance of family in inculcating social skills among, children is paramount. Guardians or parents are the prime teachers and caretakers who feed them healthy food and are also their play mates. They have to be aware themselves to be role model and make children appreciate as they grow. The benefits of enjoying nutritious food and being aware of a balanced diet is of paramount importance. Watching of television for longer duration is bad for students. Parents themselves have to be cautious in what they do in front of children and how long they are in front of the TV. However, at the same time good TV programmes are an avenue for learning. Encourage them to indulge in physical activity to build their muscles and bones. Fit body and fitness depends primarily on proper diet and healthy body and mind. The parents and elder family members need to guide them in social skills. Parents and elders have to be accessible to children for necessary guidance. They form a “safety network’. They are to guide adolescents through advice, answer their queries and occupy them through activities to keep them away from involvement in addictive substances like tobacco, drugs and alcohol which they might believe are helpful in tiding over stress.

The teacher needs to play an active role in discouraging her students from engaging in socially unhealthy practices such as vindictive attitudes, selfishness, jealousy and culture of hatred. For this, teacher has to sacrifice time and energy. It is however, necessary for a teacher and school authorities to understand that more than finishing the syllabus and passing exams, it is the teacher’s responsibility to build good human beings. Home has a large role to play but it has been the mission of teachers to contribute towards grooming students into socially healthy adults 2. Another role of a teacher in inculcating ‘social health’ is to have a friendly, stress-free atmosphere in class. This can happen if students are engaged in ‘group activities’, especially activities for ‘experiential learning’. Members of groups are reshuffled from time to time for team activities so that students may understand that it takes all kinds of people to make the world and the socially healthy groups can live in harmony despite differing in opinions.

{"id": "class 9__science__p3__c1", "text": "FOREWORD The National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2005, recommends that children’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child- centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986). The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge. These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and Reprint 2025-26"}

Everything in this universe is made up of material which scientists have named “matter”. The air we breathe, the food we eat, stones, clouds, stars, plants and animals, even a small drop of water or a particle of sand — every thing is matter. We can also see as we look around that all the things mentioned above occupy space and have mass. In other words, they have both mass* and volume**. Since early times, human beings have been trying to understand their surroundings. Early Indian philosophers classified matter in the form of five basic elements — the “Panch Tatva” — air, earth, fire, sky and water. According to them everything, living or non- living, was made up of these five basic elements. Ancient Greek philosophers had arrived at a similar classification of matter. Modern day scientists have evolved two types of classification of matter based on their physical properties and chemical nature. In this chapter we shall learn about matter based on its physical properties. Chemical aspects of matter will be taken up in subsequent chapters. 1.1 Physical Nature of Matter 1.1.1 MATTER IS MADE UP OF PARTICLES For a long time, two schools of thought prevailed regarding the nature of matter. One school believed matter to be continuous like a block of wood, whereas, the other thought that matter was made up of particles like sand. Let us perform an activity to decide about the nature of matter — is it continuous or particulate? Activity ______________ 1.1 • Take a 100 mL beaker. • Fill half the beaker with water and mark the level of water. • Dissolve some salt/ sugar with the help of a glass rod. • Observe any change in water level. • What do you think has happened to the salt? • Where does it disappear? • Does the level of water change? In order to answer these questions we need to use the idea that matter is made up of particles. What was there in the spoon, salt or sugar, has now spread throughout water. This is illustrated in Fig. 1.1. 1.1.2 HOW SMALL ARE THESE PARTICLES OF MATTER? Activity ______________ 1.2 • Take 2–3 crystals of potassium permanganate and dissolve them in 100 mL of water. Fig. 1.1: When we dissolve salt in water, the particles of salt get into the spaces between particles of water. * The SI unit of mass is kilogram (kg). ** The SI unit of volume is cubic metre (m3). The common unit of measuring volume is litre (L) such that 1L = 1 dm3, 1L = 1000 mL, 1 mL = 1 cm3. 1 MATTER ATTER ATTER ATTER ATTER IN IN IN IN IN O O O O OUR UR UR UR UR S S S S SURROUNDINGS URROUNDINGS URROUNDINGS URROUNDINGS URROUNDINGS C hapter Reprint 2025-26"}

Allow the crystals to settle at the bottom. • What do you observe just above the solid crystal in the glass? • What happens as time passes? • What does this suggest about the particles of solid and liquid? • Does the rate of mixing change with temperature? Why and how? From the above three activities (1.3, 1.4 and 1.5), we can conclude the following: Fig. 1.2: Estimating how small are the particles of matter. With every dilution, though the colour becomes light, it is still visible. This experiment shows that just a few crystals of potassium permanganate can colour a large volume of water (about 1000 L). So we conclude that there must be millions of tiny particles in just one crystal of potassium permanganate, which keep on dividing themselves into smaller and smaller particles. The same activity can be done using 2 mL of Dettol instead of potassium permanganate. The smell can be detected even on repeated dilution. The particles of matter are very small – they are small beyond our imagination!!!! 1.2 Characteristics of Particles of Matter 1.2.1 PARTICLES OF MATTER HAVE SPACE BETWEEN THEM In activities 1.1 and 1.2 we saw that particles of sugar, salt, Dettol, or potassium permanganate got evenly distributed in water. Similarly, when we make tea, coffee or lemonade (nimbu paani ), particles of one type of matter get into the spaces between particles of the other. This shows that there is enough space between particles of matter. Reprint 2025-26"}

The strength of this force of attraction varies from one kind of matter to another. uestions 1. Which of the following are matter?

Particles of matter are continuously moving, that is, they possess what we call the kinetic energy. As the temperature rises, particles move faster. So, we can say that with increase in temperature the kinetic energy of the particles also increases. In the above three activities we observe that particles of matter intermix on their own with each other. They do so by getting into the spaces between the particles. This intermixing of particles of two different types of matter on their own is called diffusion. We also observe that on heating, diffusion becomes faster.

{"id": "class 9__science__p14__c1", "text": "SCIENCE 4 1.3 States of Matter Observe different types of matter around you. What are its different states? We can see that matter around us exists in three different states– solid, liquid and gas. These states of matter arise due to the variation in the characteristics of the particles of matter. Now, let us study about the properties of these three states of matter in detail. 1.3.1 THE SOLID STATE Activity _____________ 1.9 • Collect the following articles — a pen, a book, a needle and a piece of wooden stick. • Sketch the shape of the above articles in your notebook by moving a pencil around them. • Do all these have a definite shape, distinct boundaries and a fixed volume? • What happens if they are hammered, pulled or dropped? • Are these capable of diffusing into each other? • Try compressing them by applying force. Are you able to compress them? All the above are examples of solids. We can observe that all these have a definite shape, distinct boundaries and fixed volumes, that is, have negligible compressibility. Solids have a tendency to maintain their shape when subjected to outside force. Solids may break under force but it is difficult to change their shape, so they are rigid. Consider the following: (a) What about a rubber band, can it change its shape on stretching? Is it a solid? (b) What about sugar and salt? When kept in different jars these take the shape of the jar. Are they solid? (c) What about a sponge? It is a solid yet we are able to compress it. Why? All the above are solids as: • A rubber band changes shape under force and regains the same shape when the force is removed. If excessive force is applied, it breaks. • The shape of each individual sugar or salt crystal remains fixed, whether we take it in our hand, put it in a plate or in a jar. • A sponge has minute holes, in which air is trapped, when we press it, the air is expelled out and we are able to compress it. 1.3.2 THE LIQUID STATE Activity _____________1.10 • Collect the following: (a) water, cooking oil, milk, juice, a cold drink. (b) containers of different shapes. Put a 50 mL mark on these containers using a measuring cylinder from the laboratory. • What will happen if these liquids are spilt on the floor? • Measure 50 mL of any one liquid and transfer it into different containers one by one. Does the volume remain the same? • Does the shape of the liquid remain the same ? • When you pour the liquid from one container into another, does it flow easily? We observe that liquids have no fixed shape but have a fixed volume. They take up the shape of the container in which they are kept. Liquids flow and change shape, so they are not rigid but can be called fluid. Refer to activities 1.4 and 1.5 where we saw that solids and liquids can diffuse into liquids. The gases from the atmosphere diffuse and dissolve in water. These gases, especially oxygen and carbon dioxide, are essential for the survival of aquatic animals and plants. All living creatures need to breathe for survival. The aquatic animals can breathe under water due to the presence of dissolved oxygen in water. Thus, we may conclude that solids, liquids and gases can diffuse into liquids. The rate of diffusion of liquids is Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 9__science__p15__c1", "text": "MATTER IN OUR SURROUNDINGS 5 higher than that of solids. This is due to the fact that in the liquid state, particles move freely and have greater space between each other as compared to particles in the solid state. 1.3.3 THE GASEOUS STATE Have you ever observed a balloon seller filling a large number of balloons from a single cylinder of gas? Enquire from him how many balloons is he able to fill from one cylinder. Ask him which gas does he have in the cylinder. Activity _____________1.11 • Take three 100 mL syringes and close their nozzles by rubber corks, as shown in Fig.1.4. • Remove the pistons from all the syringes. • Leaving one syringe untouched, fill water in the second and pieces of chalk in the third. • Insert the pistons back into the syringes. You may apply some vaseline on the pistons before inserting them into the syringes for their smooth movement. • Now, try to compress the content by pushing the piston in each syringe. We have observed that gases are highly compressible as compared to solids and liquids. The liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinder that we get in our home for cooking or the oxygen supplied to hospitals in cylinders is compressed gas. Compressed natural gas (CNG) is used as fuel these days in vehicles. Due to its high compressibility, large volumes of a gas can be compressed into a small cylinder and transported easily. We come to know of what is being cooked in the kitchen without even entering there, by the smell that reaches our nostrils. How does this smell reach us? The particles of the aroma of food mix with the particles of air spread from the kitchen, reach us and even farther away. The smell of hot cooked food reaches us in seconds; compare this with the rate of diffusion of solids and liquids. Due to high speed of particles and large space between them, gases show the property of diffusing very fast into other gases. In the gaseous state, the particles move about randomly at high speed. Due to this random movement, the particles hit each other and also the walls of the container. The pressure exerted by the gas is because of this force exerted by gas particles per unit area on the walls of the container. Fig. 1.4 • What do you observe? In which case was the piston easily pushed in? • What do you infer from your observations? Fig.1.5: a, b and c show the magnified schematic pictures of the three states of matter. The motion of the particles can be seen and compared in the three states of matter. Reprint 2025-26"}

Arrange the following in order of increasing density – air, exhaust from chimneys, honey, water, chalk, cotton and iron. 2. (a) Tabulate the differences in the characterisitcs of states of matter. (b) Comment upon the following: rigidity, compressibility, fluidity, filling a gas container, shape, kinetic energy and density. 3.

We all know from our observation that water can exist in three states of matter– • solid, as ice, • liquid, as the familiar water, and • gas, as water vapour. What happens inside the matter during this change of state? What happens to the particles of matter during the change of states? How does this change of state take place? We need answers to these questions, isn’t it? Q (a) (b) Fig. 1.6: (a) Conversion of ice to water, (b) conversion of water to water vapour Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 9__science__p17__c1", "text": "MATTER IN OUR SURROUNDINGS 7 • Start heating the beaker on a low flame. • Note the temperature when the ice starts melting. • Note the temperature when all the ice has converted into water. • Record your observations for this conversion of solid to liquid state. • Now, put a glass rod in the beaker and heat while stirring till the water starts boiling. • Keep a careful eye on the thermometer reading till most of the water has vaporised. • Record your observations for the conversion of water in the liquid state to the gaseous state. On increasing the temperature of solids, the kinetic energy of the particles increases. Due to the increase in kinetic energy, the particles start vibrating with greater speed. The energy supplied by heat overcomes the forces of attraction between the particles. The particles leave their fixed positions and start moving more freely. A stage is reached when the solid melts and is converted to a liquid. The minimum temperature at which a solid melts to become a liquid at the atmospheric pressure is called its melting point. The melting point of a solid is an indication of the strength of the force of attraction between its particles. The melting point of ice is 273.15 K*. The process of melting, that is, change of solid state into liquid state is also known as fusion. When a solid melts, its temperature remains the same, so where does the heat energy go? You must have observed, during the experiment of melting, that the temperature of the system does not change after the melting point is reached, till all the ice melts. This happens even though we continue to heat the beaker, that is, we continue to supply heat. This heat gets used up in changing the state by overcoming the forces of attraction between the particles. As this heat energy is absorbed by ice without showing any rise in temperature, it is considered that it gets hidden into the contents of the beaker and is known as the latent heat. The word latent means hidden. The amount of heat energy that is required to change 1 kg of a solid into liquid at atmospheric pressure at its melting point is known as the latent heat of fusion. So, particles in water at 0oC (273 K) have more energy as compared to particles in ice at the same temperature. When we supply heat energy to water, particles start moving even faster. At a certain temperature, a point is reached when the particles have enough energy to break free from the forces of attraction of each other. At this temperature the liquid starts changing into gas. The temperature at which a liquid starts boiling at the atmospheric pressure is known as its boiling point. Boiling is a bulk phenomenon. Particles from the bulk of the liquid gain enough energy to change into the vapour state. For water this temperature is 373 K (100oC = 273 + 100 = 373 K). Can you define the latent heat of vaporisation? Do it in the same way as we have defined the latent heat of fusion. Particles in steam, that is, water vapour at 373 K (1000 C) have more energy than water at the same temperature. This is because particles in steam have absorbed extra energy in the form of latent heat of vaporisation. *Note: Kelvin is the SI unit of temperature, 0o C =273.15 K. For convenience, we take 0o C = 273 K after rounding off the decimal. To change a temperature on the Kelvin scale to the Celsius scale you have to subtract 273 from the given temperature, and to convert a temperature on the Celsius scale to the Kelvin scale you have to add 273 to the given temperature. So, we infer that the state of matter can be changed into another state by changing the temperature. We have learnt that substances around us change state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas on application of heat. But there Reprint 2025-26"}

Crush it and put it in a china dish. • Put an inverted funnel over the china dish. • Put a cotton plug on the stem of the funnel, as shown in Fig. 1.7. * atmosphere (atm) is a unit of measuring pressure exerted by a gas. The unit of pressure is Pascal (Pa): 1 atmosphere = 1.01 × 105 Pa. The pressure of air in atmosphere is called atmospheric pressure. The atmospheric pressure at sea level is 1 atmosphere, and is taken as the normal atmospheric pressure. Fig. 1.7: Sublimation of camphor Fig. 1.8: By applying pressure, particles of matter can be brought close together Applying pressure and reducing temperature can liquefy gases. Have you heard of solid carbon dioxide (CO2)? It is stored under high pressure. Solid CO2 gets converted directly into gaseous state on decrease of pressure to 1 atmosphere* without coming into liquid state. This is the reason that solid carbon dioxide is also known as dry ice. Thus, we can say that pressure and temperature determine the state of a substance, whether it will be solid, liquid or gas. • Now, heat slowly and observe. • What do you infer from the above activity? A change of state directly from solid to gas without changing into liquid state is called sublimation and the direct change of gas to solid without changing into liquid is called deposition. 1.4.2 EFFECT OF CHANGE OF PRESSURE We have already learnt that the difference in various states of matter is due to the difference in the distances between the constituent particles.

For example, while putting clothes for drying up we spread them out. • an increase of temperature: With the increase of temperature, more number of particles get enough kinetic energy to go into the vapour state. • a decrease in humidity: Humidity is the amount of water vapour present in air. The air around us cannot hold more than a definite amount of water vapour at a given temperature. If the amount of water in air is already high, the rate of evaporation decreases. • an increase in wind speed: It is a common observation that clothes dry faster on a windy day. With the increase in wind speed, the particles of water vapour move away with the wind, decreasing the amount of water vapour in the surrounding. 1.5.2 HOW DOES EVAPORATION CAUSE COOLING? In an open vessel, the liquid keeps on evaporating. The particles of liquid absorb energy from the surrounding to regain the energy lost during evaporation. This absorption of energy from the surroundings make the surroundings cold. uestions 1. Convert the following temperature to celsius scale: a. 300 K b. 573 K 2.

Suggest a method to liquefy atmospheric gases. 1.5 Evaporation Do we always need to heat or change pressure for changing the state of matter? Can you quote some examples from everyday life where change of state from liquid to vapour takes place without the liquid reaching the boiling point? Water, when left uncovered, slowly changes into vapour. Wet clothes dry up. What happens to water in the above two examples? We know that particles of matter are always moving and are never at rest. At a given temperature in any gas, liquid or solid, there are particles with different amounts of kinetic energy. In the case of liquids, a small fraction of particles at the surface, having higher kinetic energy, is able to break away from the forces of attraction of other particles and gets converted into vapour. This phenomenon of change of liquid into vapours at any temperature below its boiling point is called evaporation. 1.5.1 FACTORS AFFECTING EVAPORATION Let us understand this with an activity.

What happens when you pour some acetone (nail polish remover) on your palm? The particles gain energy from your palm or surroundings and evaporate causing the palm to feel cool. After a hot sunny day, people sprinkle water on the roof or open ground because the large latent heat of vaporisation of water helps to cool the hot surface. Can you cite some more examples from daily life where we can feel the effect of cooling due to evaporation? Why should we wear cotton clothes in summer? During summer, we perspire more because of the mechanism of our body which keeps us cool. We know that during evaporation, the particles at the surface of the liquid gain energy from the surroundings or body surface and change into vapour. The heat energy equal to the latent heat of vaporisation is absorbed from the body leaving the body cool. Cotton, being a good absorber of water helps in absorbing the sweat and exposing it to the atmosphere for easy evaporation. Why do we see water droplets on the outer surface of a glass containing ice-cold water? Let us take some ice-cold water in a tumbler. Soon we will see water droplets on the outer surface of the tumbler. The water vapour present in air, on coming in contact with the cold glass of water, loses energy and gets converted to liquid state, which we see as water droplets. uestions 1.

{"id": "class 9__science__p24__c1", "text": "Fig. 2.1: Some consumable items Have you ever noticed the word ‘pure’ written on the packs of these consumables? For a common person pure means having no adulteration. But, for a scientist all these things are actually mixtures of different substances and hence not pure. For example, milk is actually a mixture of water, fat, proteins, etc. When a scientist says that something is pure, it means that all the constituent particles of that substance are the same in their chemical nature. A pure substance consists of a single type of particle. In other words, a substance is a pure single form of matter. As we look around, we can see that most of the matter around us exists as mixtures of two or more pure components, for example, sea water, minerals, soil, etc., are all mixtures. 2.1 What is a Mixture? Mixtures are constituted by more than one kind of pure form of matter. We know that dissolved sodium chloride can be separated from water by the physical process of evaporation. However, sodium chloride is itself a pure substance and cannot be separated by physical process into its chemical constituents. Similarly, sugar is a substance which contains only one kind of pure matter and its composition is the same throughout. Soft drink and soil are not single pure substances. Whatever the source of a pure substance may be, it will always have the same characteristic properties. Therefore, we can say that a mixture contains more than one pure substance. 2.1.1 TYPES OF MIXTURES Depending upon the nature of the components that form a mixture, we can have different types of mixtures. Activity ______________ 2.1 • Let us divide the class into groups A, B, C and D. • Group A takes a beaker containing 50 mL of water and one spatula full of copper sulphate powder. Group B takes 50 mL of water and two spatula full of copper sulphate powder in a beaker. • Groups C and D can take different amounts of copper sulphate and potassium permanganate or common salt (sodium chloride) and mix the given components to form a mixture. • Report the observations on the uniformity in colour and texture. • Groups A and B have obtained a mixture which has a uniform composition throughout. Such mixtures are called homogeneous mixtures or solutions. Some other examples of such mixtures are: (i) salt dissolved in water and (ii) sugar dissolved in water.

Such mixtures are called heterogeneous mixtures. Mixtures of sodium chloride and iron filings, salt and sulphur, and oil and water are examples of heterogeneous mixtures.

Are the particles in the mixture visible? • Direct a beam of light from a torch through the beaker containing the mixture and observe from the front. Was the path of the beam of light visible? • Leave the mixtures undisturbed for a few minutes (and set up the filtration apparatus in the meantime). Is the mixture stable or do the particles begin to settle after some time? • Filter the mixture. Is there any residue on the filter paper? • Discuss the results and form an opinion. Groups A and B have got a solution. Group C has got a suspension. Group D has got a colloidal solution. Now, we shall learn about solutions, suspensions and colloidal solutions in the following sections. uestions 1. What is meant by a substance? 2. List the points of differences between homogeneous and heterogeneous mixtures. 2.2 What is a Solution? A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances. You come across various types of solutions in your daily life. Lemonade, soda water, etc., are all examples of solutions. Usually we think of a solution as a liquid that contains either a solid, liquid or a gas dissolved in it. But, we can also have solid solutions (alloys) and gaseous solutions (air). In a solution there is homogeneity at the particle level. For example, lemonade tastes the same throughout. This shows that particles of sugar or salt are evenly distributed in the solution. Q Fig. 2.2: Filtration Alloys: Alloys are mixtures of two or more metals or a metal and a non-metal and cannot be separated into their components by physical methods. But still, an alloy is considered as a mixture because it shows the properties of its constituents and can have variable composition. For example, brass is a mixture of approximately 30% zinc and 70% copper. IS MATTER AROUND US PURE? 15 Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 9__science__p26__c1", "text": "SCIENCE 16 A solution has a solvent and a solute as its components. The component of the solution that dissolves the other component in it (usually the component present in larger amount) is called the solvent. The component of the solution that is dissolved in the solvent (usually present in lesser quantity) is called the solute. Examples: (i) A solution of sugar in water is a solid in liquid solution. In this solution, sugar is the solute and water is the solvent. (ii) A solution of iodine in alcohol known as ‘tincture of iodine’, has iodine (solid) as the solute and alcohol (liquid) as the solvent. (iii) Aerated drinks like soda water, etc., are gas in liquid solutions. These contain carbon dioxide (gas) as solute and water (liquid) as solvent. (iv) Air is a mixture of gas in gas. Air is a homogeneous mixture of a number of gases. Its two main constituents are: oxygen (21%) and nitrogen (78%). The other gases are present in very small quantities. Properties of a Solution • A solution is a homogeneous mixture. • The particles of a solution are smaller than 1 nm (10-9 metre) in diameter. So, they cannot be seen by naked eyes. • Because of very small particle size, they do not scatter a beam of light passing through the solution. So, the path of light is not visible in a solution. • The solute particles cannot be separated from the mixture by the process of filtration. The solute particles do not settle down when left undisturbed, that is, a solution is stable. 2.2.1 CONCENTRATION OF A SOLUTION In activity 2.2, we observed that groups A and B obtained different shades of solutions. So, we understand that in a solution the relative proportion of the solute and solvent can be varied. Depending upon the amount of solute present in a solution, it can be called dilute, concentrated or saturated solution. Dilute and concentrated are comparative terms. In activity 2.2, the solution obtained by group A is dilute as compared to that obtained by group B. Activity ______________ 2.3 • Take approximately 50 mL of water each in two separate beakers. • Add salt in one beaker and sugar or barium chloride in the second beaker with continuous stirring. • When no more solute can be dissolved, heat the contents of the beaker to raise the temperature by about 5oC.° • Start adding the solute again. Is the amount of salt and sugar or barium chloride, that can be dissolved in water at a given temperature, the same? At any particular temperature, a solution that has dissolved as much solute as it is capable of dissolving, is said to be a saturated solution. In other words, when no more solute can be dissolved in a solution at a given temperature, it is called a saturated solution. The amount of the solute present in the saturated solution at this temperature is called its solubility. If the amount of solute contained in a solution is less than the saturation level, it is called an unsaturated solution. What would happen if you were to take a saturated solution at a certain temperature and cool it slowly. We can infer from the above activity that different substances in a given solvent have different solubilities at the same temperature. The concentration of a solution is the amount (mass or volume) of solute present in a given amount (mass or volume) of solution. There are various ways of expressing the concentration of a solution, but here we will learn only three methods.

Calculate the concentration in terms of mass by mass percentage of the solution. Solution: Mass of solute (salt) = 40 g Mass of solvent (water) = 320 g We know, Mass of solution = Mass of solute + Mass of solvent = 40 g + 320 g = 360 g Mass percentage of solution Mass of solute = ×100 Massof solution 40 = ×100 =11.1% 360 2.2.2 WHAT IS A SUSPENSION? Non-homogeneous systems, like those obtained by group C in activity 2.2, in which solids are dispersed in liquids, are called suspensions. A suspension is a heterogeneous mixture in which the solute particles do not dissolve but remain suspended throughout the bulk of the medium. Particles of a suspension are visible to the naked eye. Properties of a Suspension • Suspension is a heterogeneous mixture. • The particles of a suspension can be seen by the naked eye. • The particles of a suspension scatter a beam of light passing through it and make its path visible. • The solute particles settle down when a suspension is left undisturbed, that is, a suspension is unstable. They can be separated from the mixture by the process of filtration. When the particles settle down, the suspension breaks and it does not scatter light any more. 2.2.3 WHAT IS A COLLOIDAL SOLUTION? The mixture obtained by group D in activity 2.2 is called a colloid or a colloidal solution. The particles of a colloid are uniformly spread throughout the solution. Due to the relatively smaller size of particles, as compared to that of a suspension, the mixture appears to be homogeneous. But actually, a colloidal solution is a heterogeneous mixture, for example, milk. Because of the small size of colloidal particles, we cannot see them with naked eyes. But, these particles can easily scatter a beam of visible light as observed in activity 2.2. This scattering of a beam of light is called the Tyndall effect after the name of the scientist who discovered this effect. Tyndall effect can also be observed when a fine beam of light enters a room through a small hole. This happens due to the scattering of light by the particles of dust and smoke in the air.

But, a special technique of separation known as centrifugation can be used to separate the colloidal particles. The components of a colloidal solution are the dispersed phase and the dispersion medium. The solute-like component or the dispersed particles in a colloid form the dispersed phase, and the component in which the dispersed phase is suspended is known as the dispersing medium. Colloids are classified according to the state (solid, liquid or gas) of the dispersing medium and the dispersed phase. A few common examples are given in Table 2.1. From this table you can see that they are very common everyday life. Tyndall effect can be observed when sunlight passes through the canopy of a dense forest. In the forest, mist contains tiny droplets of water, which act as particles of colloid dispersed in air. Fig. 2.4: Fig. 2.4: Fig. 2.4: Fig. 2.4: Fig. 2.4: The Tyndall effect uestions 1.

The properties that can be observed and specified like colour, hardness, rigidity, fluidity, density, melting point, boiling point etc. are the physical properites. The interconversion of states is a physical change because these changes occur without a change in composition and no change in the chemical nature of the substance. Although ice, water and water vapour all look different and display different physical properties, they are chemically the same. Both water and cooking oil are liquid but their chemical characteristics are different. They differ in odour and inflammability. We know that oil burns in air whereas water extinguishes fire. It is this chemical property of oil that makes it different from water. Burning is a chemical change. During this process one substance reacts with another to undergo a change in chemical composition. Chemical change brings change in the chemical properties of matter and we get new substances. A chemical change is also called a chemical reaction. During burning of a candle, both physical and chemical changes take place. Can you distinguish these? uestions 1. Classify the following as chemical or physical changes: • cutting of trees, • melting of butter in a pan, • rusting of almirah, • boiling of water to form steam, • passing of electric current, through water and the water breaking down into hydrogen and oxygen gases, • dissolving common salt in water, • making a fruit salad with raw fruits, and Q • burning of paper and wood. 2. Try segregating the things around you as pure substances or mixtures. 2.4 What are the Types of Pure Substances? On the basis of their chemical composition, substances can be classified either as elements or compounds. 2.4.1 ELEMENTS Robert Boyle was the first scientist to use the term element in 1661. Antoine Laurent Lavoisier (1743–94), a French chemist, was the first to establish an experimentally useful definition of an element. He defined an element as a basic form of matter that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical reactions. Elements can be normally divided into metals, non-metals and metalloids. Metals usually show some or all of the following properties: • They have a lustre (shine). • They have silvery-grey or golden-yellow colour. • They conduct heat and electricity. • They are ductile (can be drawn into wires). • They are malleable (can be hammered into thin sheets). • They are sonorous (make a ringing sound when hit). Examples of metals are gold, silver, copper, iron, sodium, potassium etc. Mercury is the only metal that is liquid at room temperature. Non-metals usually show some or all of the following properties: • They display a variety of colours. • They are poor conductors of heat and electricity. • They are not lustrous, sonorous or malleable. Examples of non-metals are hydrogen, oxygen, iodine, carbon (coal, coke), bromine, Reprint 2025-26"}

{"id": "class 9__science__p36__c1", "text": "Ancient Indian and Greek philosophers have always wondered about the unknown and unseen form of matter. The idea of divisibility of matter was considered long back in India, around 500 BC. An Indian philosopher Maharishi Kanad, postulated that if we go on dividing matter (padarth), we shall get smaller and smaller particles. Ultimately, a stage will come when we shall come across the smallest particles beyond which further division will not be possible. He named these particles Parmanu. Another Indian philosopher, Pakudha Katyayama, elaborated this doctrine and said that these particles normally exist in a combined form which gives us various forms of matter. Around the same era, ancient Greek philosophers – Democritus and Leucippus suggested that if we go on dividing matter, a stage will come when particles obtained cannot be divided further. Democritus called these indivisible particles atoms (meaning indivisible). All this was based on philosophical considerations and not much experimental work to validate these ideas could be done till the eighteenth century. By the end of the eighteenth century, scientists recognised the difference between elements and compounds and naturally became interested in finding out how and why elements combine and what happens when they combine. Antoine L. Lavoisier laid the foundation of chemical sciences by establishing two important laws of chemical combination. 3.1 Laws of Chemical Combination The following two laws of chemical combination were established after much experimentations by Lavoisier and Joseph L. Proust. 3.1.1 LAW OF CONSERVATION OF MASS Is there a change in mass when a chemical change (chemical reaction) takes place? Activity ______________ 3.1 • Take one of the following sets, X and Y of chemicals— X Y (i) copper sulphate sodium carbonate (ii) barium chloride sodium sulphate (iii) lead nitrate sodium chloride • Prepare separately a 5% solution of any one pair of substances listed under X and Y each in 10 mL in water. • Take a little amount of solution of Y in a conical flask and some solution of X in an ignition tube. • Hang the ignition tube in the flask carefully; see that the solutions do not get mixed. Put a cork on the flask (see Fig. 3.1).

Law of conservation of mass states that mass can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. 3.1.2 LAW OF CONSTANT PROPORTIONS Lavoisier, along with other scientists, noted that many compounds were composed of two or more elements and each such compound had the same elements in the same proportions, irrespective of where the compound came from or who prepared it. In a compound such as water, the ratio of the mass of hydrogen to the mass of oxygen is always 1:8, whatever the source of water. Thus, if 9 g of water is decomposed, 1 g of hydrogen and 8 g of oxygen are always obtained. Similarly in ammonia, nitrogen and hydrogen are always present in the ratio 14:3 by mass, whatever the method or the source from which it is obtained. This led to the law of constant proportions which is also known as the law of definite proportions. This law was stated by Proust as “In a chemical substance the elements are always present in definite proportions by mass”. The next problem faced by scientists was to give appropriate explanations of these laws. British chemist John Dalton provided the basic theory about the nature of matter. Dalton picked up the idea of divisibility of matter, which was till then just a philosophy. He took the name ‘atoms’ as given by the Greeks and said that the smallest particles of matter are atoms. His theory was based on the laws of chemical combination. Dalton’s atomic theory provided an explanation for the law of conservation of mass and the law of definite proportions. John Dalton was born in a poor weaver’s family in 1766 in England. He began his career as a teacher at the age of twelve. Seven years later he became a school principal. In 1793, Dalton left for Manchester to teach mathematics, physics and chemistry in a college. He spent most of his life there teaching and researching. In 1808, he presented his atomic theory which was a turning point in the study of matter. According to Dalton’s atomic theory, all matter, whether an element, a compound or a mixture is composed of small particles called atoms. The postulates of this theory may be stated as follows: (i) All matter is made of very tiny particles called atoms, which participate in chemical reactions. (ii) Atoms are indivisible particles, which cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction. (iii) Atoms of a given element are identical in mass and chemical properties. (iv) Atoms of different elements have different masses and chemical properties. (v) Atoms combine in the ratio of small whole numbers to form compounds. (vi) The relative number and kinds of atoms are constant in a given compound. You will study in the next chapter that all atoms are made up of still smaller particles. uestions 1.

What about the building block of an ant-hill? It is a small grain of sand. Similarly, the building blocks of all matter are atoms. How big are atoms? Atoms are very small, they are smaller than anything that we can imagine or compare with. More than millions of atoms when stacked would make a layer barely as thick as this sheet of paper.

Dalton was the first scientist to use the symbols for elements in a very specific sense. When he used a symbol for an element he also meant a definite quantity of that element, that is, one atom of that element. Berzilius suggested that the symbols of elements be made from one or two letters of the name of the element. Fig. 3.3: Symbols for some elements as proposed by Dalton Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 9__science__p39__c1", "text": "ATOMS AND MOLECULES 29 In the beginning, the names of elements were derived from the name of the place where they were found for the first time. For example, the name copper was taken from Cyprus. Some names were taken from specific colours. For example, gold was taken from the English word meaning yellow. Now-a-days, IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) is an international scientific organisation which approves names of elements, symbols and units. Many of the symbols are the first one or two letters of the element’s name in English. The first letter of a symbol is always written as a capital letter (uppercase) and the second letter as a small letter (lowercase). For example (i) hydrogen, H (ii) aluminium, Al and not AL (iii) cobalt, Co and not CO. Symbols of some elements are formed from the first letter of the name and a letter, appearing later in the name. Examples are: (i) chlorine, Cl, (ii) zinc, Zn etc. Other symbols have been taken from the names of elements in Latin, German or Greek. For example, the symbol of iron is Fe from its Latin name ferrum, sodium is Na from natrium, potassium is K from kalium. Therefore, each element has a name and a unique chemical symbol. (The above table is given for you to refer to whenever you study about elements. Do not bother to memorise all in one go. With the passage of time and repeated usage you will automatically be able to reproduce the symbols). 3.2.2 ATOMIC MASS The most remarkable concept that Dalton’s atomic theory proposed was that of the atomic mass. According to him, each element had a characteristic atomic mass. The theory could explain the law of constant proportions so well that scientists were prompted to measure the atomic mass of an atom. Since determining the mass of an individual atom was a relatively difficult task, relative atomic masses were determined using the laws of chemical combinations and the compounds formed. Let us take the example of a compound, carbon monoxide (CO) formed by carbon and oxygen. It was observed experimentally that 3 g of carbon combines with 4 g of oxygen to form CO. In other words, carbon combines with 4/3 times its mass of oxygen. Suppose we define the atomic mass unit (earlier abbreviated as ‘amu’, but according to the latest IUPAC recommendations, it is now written as ‘u’ – unified mass) as equal to the mass of one carbon atom, then we would assign carbon an atomic mass of 1.0 u and oxygen an atomic mass of 1.33 u. However, it is more convenient to have these numbers as Table 3.1: Symbols for some elements Element Symbol Element Symbol Element Symbol Aluminium Al Copper Cu Nitrogen N Argon Ar Fluorine F Oxygen O Barium Ba Gold Au Potassium K Boron B Hydrogen H Silicon Si Bromine Br Iodine I Silver Ag Calcium Ca Iron Fe Sodium Na Carbon C Lead Pb Sulphur S Chlorine Cl Magnesium Mg Uranium U Cobalt Co Neon Ne Zinc Zn Reprint 2025-26"}

While searching for various atomic mass units, scientists initially took 1/ 16 of the mass of an atom of naturally occurring oxygen as the unit. This was considered relevant due to two reasons: • oxygen reacted with a large number of elements and formed compounds. • this atomic mass unit gave masses of most of the elements as whole numbers. However, in 1961 for a universally accepted atomic mass unit, carbon-12 isotope was chosen as the standard reference for measuring atomic masses. One atomic mass unit is a mass unit equal to exactly one-twelfth (1/12th) the mass of one atom of carbon-12. The relative atomic masses of all elements have been found with respect to an atom of carbon-12. Imagine a fruit seller selling fruits without any standard weight with him. He takes a watermelon and says, “this has a mass equal to 12 units” (12 watermelon units or 12 fruit mass units). He makes twelve equal pieces of the watermelon and finds the mass of each fruit he is selling, relative to the mass of one piece of the watermelon. Now he sells his fruits by relative fruit mass unit (fmu), as in Fig. 3.4. Fig. 3.4 : (a) Watermelon, (b) 12 pieces, (c) 1/12 of watermelon, (d) how the fruit seller can weigh the fruits using pieces of watermelon Similarly, the relative atomic mass of the atom of an element is defined as the average mass of the atom, as compared to 1/12th the mass of one carbon-12 atom.

A molecule can be defined as the smallest particle of an element or a compound that is capable of an independent existence and shows all the properties of that substance.

Molecules of many elements, such as argon (Ar), helium (He) etc. are made up of only one atom of that element. But this is not the case with most of the non- metals. For example, a molecule of oxygen consists of two atoms of oxygen and hence it is known as a diatomic molecule, O2. If 3 atoms of oxygen unite into a molecule, instead of the usual 2, we get ozone, O3. The number of atoms constituting a molecule is known as its atomicity. Metals and some other elements, such as carbon, do not have a simple structure but consist of a very large and indefinite number of atoms bonded together. Let us look at the atomicity of some non-metals.

Compounds composed of metals and non- metals contain charged species. The charged species are known as ions. Ions may consist of a single charged atom or a group of atoms that have a net charge on them. An ion can be negatively or positively charged. A negatively charged ion is called an ‘anion’ and the positively charged ion, a ‘cation’. Take, for example, sodium chloride (NaCl). Its constituent particles are positively charged sodium ions (Na+) and negatively charged 3.3.2 MOLECULES OF COMPOUNDS Atoms of different elements join together in definite proportions to form molecules of compounds.

Valency can be used to find out how the atoms of an element will combine with the atom(s) of another element to form a chemical compound. The valency of the atom of an element can be thought of as hands or arms of that atom. Human beings have two arms and an octopus has eight. If one octopus has to catch hold of a few people in such a manner that all the eight arms of the octopus and both arms of all the humans are locked, how many humans do you think the octopus can hold?

The existence of different kinds of matter is due to different atoms constituting them. Now the questions arise: (i) What makes the atom of one element different from the atom of another element? and (ii) Are atoms really indivisible, as proposed by Dalton, or are there smaller constituents inside the atom? We shall find out the answers to these questions in this chapter. We will learn about sub-atomic particles and the various models that have been proposed to explain how these particles are arranged within the atom. A major challenge before the scientists at the end of the 19th century was to reveal the structure of the atom as well as to explain its important properties. The elucidation of the structure of atoms is based on a series of experiments. One of the first indications that atoms are not indivisible, comes from studying static electricity and the condition under which electricity is conducted by different substances. 4.1 Charged Particles in Matter For understanding the nature of charged particles in matter, let us carry out the following activities: Activity ______________ 4.1 A. Comb dry hair. Does the comb then attract small pieces of paper? B. Rub a glass rod with a silk cloth and bring the rod near an inflated balloon. Observe what happens. From these activities, can we conclude that on rubbing two objects together, they become electrically charged? Where does this charge come from? This question can be answered by knowing that an atom is divisible and consists of charged particles. Many scientists contributed in revealing the presence of charged particles in an atom. It was known by 1900 that the atom was indivisible particle but contained at least one sub-atomic particle – the electron identified by J.J. Thomson. Even before the electron was identified, E. Goldstein in 1886 discovered the presence of new radiations in a gas discharge and called them canal rays. These rays were positively charged radiations which ultimately led to the discovery of another sub-atomic particle. This sub-atomic particle had a charge, equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to that of the electron. Its mass was approximately 2000 times as that of the electron. It was given the name of proton. In general, an electron is represented as ‘e–’ and a proton as ‘p+’. The mass of a proton is taken as one unit and its charge as plus one. The mass of an electron is considered to be negligible and its charge is minus one. It seemed that an atom was composed of protons and electrons, mutually balancing their charges. It also appeared that the protons were in the interior of the atom, for whereas electrons could easily be removed off but not protons. Now the big question was: what sort of structure did these particles of the atom form? We will find the answer to this question below. 4 STRUCTURE TRUCTURE TRUCTURE TRUCTURE TRUCTURE OF OF OF OF OF THE THE THE THE THE A A A A ATOM TOM TOM TOM TOM C hapter Reprint 2025-26"}

If an atom contains one electron and one proton, will it carry any charge or not? 4.2 The Structure of an Atom We have learnt Dalton’s atomic theory in Chapter 3, which suggested that the atom was indivisible and indestructible. But the discovery of two fundamental particles (electrons and protons) inside the atom, led to the failure of this aspect of Dalton’s atomic theory. It was then considered necessary to know how electrons and protons are arranged within an atom. For explaining this, many scientists proposed various atomic models. J.J. Thomson was the first one to propose a model for the structure of an atom. 4.2.1 THOMSON’S MODEL OF AN ATOM Thomson proposed the model of an atom to be similar to that of a Christmas pudding. The electrons, in a sphere of positive charge, were like currants (dry fruits) in a spherical Christmas pudding. We can also think of a watermelon, the positive charge in the atom is spread all over like the red edible part of the watermelon, while the electrons are studded in the positively charged sphere, like the seeds in the watermelon (Fig. 4.1). Thomson proposed that: (i) An atom consists of a positively charged sphere and the electrons are embedded in it. (ii) The negative and positive charges are equal in magnitude. So, the atom as a whole is electrically neutral. Although Thomson’s model explained that atoms are electrically neutral, the results of experiments carried out by other scientists could not be explained by this model, as we will see below. 4.2.2 RUTHERFORD’S MODEL OF AN ATOM Ernest Rutherford was interested in knowing how the electrons are arranged within an atom. Rutherford designed an experiment for this. In this experiment, fast moving alpha (α)-particles were made to fall on a thin gold foil. • He selected a gold foil because he wanted as thin a layer as possible. This gold foil was about 1000 atoms thick. • α-particles are doubly-charged helium ions. Since they have a mass of 4 u, the fast-moving α-particles have a considerable amount of energy. • It was expected that α-particles would be deflected by the sub-atomic particles in the gold atoms. Since the α-particles were much heavier than the protons, he did not expect to see large deflections. Q Fig.4.1: Thomson’s model of an atom J.J. Thomson (1856– 1940), a British physicist, was born in Cheetham Hill, a suburb of Manchester, on 18 December 1856. He was awarded the Nobel prize in Physics in 1906 for his work on the discovery of electrons. He directed the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge for 35 years and seven of his research assistants subsequently won Nobel prizes. STRUCTURE OF THE ATOM 39 Reprint 2025-26"}

The following observations were made: (i) Most of the fast moving α-particles passed straight through the gold foil. (ii) Some of the α-particles were deflected by the foil by small angles. (iii) Surprisingly one out of every 12000 particles appeared to rebound. In the words of Rutherford, “This result was almost as incredible as if you fire a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it comes back and hits you”. He will hear a sound when each stone strikes the wall. If he repeats this ten times, he will hear the sound ten times. But if a blind-folded child were to throw stones at a barbed-wire fence, most of the stones would not hit the fencing and no sound would be heard. This is because there are lots of gaps in the fence which allow the stone to pass through them. Following a similar reasoning, Rutherford concluded from the α-particle scattering experiment that— (i) Most of the space inside the atom is empty because most of the α-particles passed through the gold foil without getting deflected. (ii) Very few particles were deflected from their path, indicating that the positive charge of the atom occupies very little space. (iii) A very small fraction of α-particles were deflected by 1800, indicating that all the positive charge and mass of the gold atom were concentrated in a very small volume within the atom. From the data he also calculated that the radius of the nucleus is about 105 times less than the radius of the atom. On the basis of his experiment, Rutherford put forward the nuclear model of an atom, which had the following features: (i) There is a positively charged centre in an atom called the nucleus. Nearly all the mass of an atom resides in the nucleus. (ii) The electrons revolve around the nucleus in circular paths. (iii) The size of the nucleus is very small as compared to the size of the atom. Drawbacks of Rutherford’s model of the atom The revolution of the electron in a circular orbit is not expected to be stable. Any particle in a circular orbit would undergo acceleration. During acceleration, charged particles would radiate energy. Thus, the revolving electron would lose energy and finally fall into the nucleus. If this were so, the atom should be highly unstable and hence matter would not exist in the form that we know. We know that atoms are quite stable. E. Rutherford (1871–1937) was born at Spring Grove on 30 August 1871. He was known as the ‘Father’ of nuclear physics. He is famous for his work on radioactivity and the discovery of the nucleus of an atom with the gold foil experiment. He got the Nobel prize in chemistry in 1908. Let us think of an activity in an open field to understand the implications of this experiment. Let a child stand in front of a wall with his eyes closed. Let him throw stones at the wall from a distance. Reprint 2025-26"}

Chadwick discovered another sub- atomic particle which had no charge and a mass nearly equal to that of a proton. It was eventually named as neutron. Neutrons are present in the nucleus of all atoms, except hydrogen. In general, a neutron is represented as ‘n’.

The combining capacity of the atoms of elements, that is, their tendency to react and form molecules with atoms of the same or different elements, was thus explained as an attempt to attain a fully-filled outermost shell. An outermost-shell, which had eight electrons was said to possess an octet. Atoms would thus react, so as to achieve an octet in the outermost shell. This was done by sharing, gaining or losing electrons. The number of electrons gained, lost or shared so as to make the octet of electrons in the outermost shell, gives us directly the combining capacity of the element, that is, the valency discussed in the previous chapter. For example, hydrogen/ lithium/sodium atoms contain one electron each in their outermost shell, therefore each one of them can lose one electron. So, they are said to have valency of one. Can you tell, what is valency of magnesium and aluminium? It is two and three, respectively, because magnesium has two electrons in its outermost shell and aluminium has three electrons in its outermost shell. If the number of electrons in the outermost shell of an atom is close to its full capacity, then valency is determined in a different way.

Hence, its valency is determined by subtracting seven electrons from the octet and this gives you a valency of one for fluorine. Valency can be calculated in a similar manner for oxygen. What is the valency of oxygen that you get from this calculation? Therefore, an atom of each element has a definite combining capacity, called its valency. Valency of the first eighteen elements is given in the last column of Table 4.1. uestion 1. How will you find the valency of chlorine, sulphur and magnesium? 4.5 Atomic Number and Mass Number 4.5.1 ATOMIC NUMBER We know that protons are present in the nucleus of an atom. It is the number of protons of an atom, which determines its atomic number. It is denoted by ‘Z’. All atoms of an element have the same atomic number, Z. In fact, elements are defined by the number of protons they possess. For hydrogen, Z = 1, because in hydrogen atom, only one proton is present in the nucleus. Similarly, for carbon, Z = 6. Therefore, the atomic number is defined as the total number of protons present in the nucleus of an atom. 4.5.2 MASS NUMBER After studying the properties of the sub- atomic particles of an atom, we can conclude that mass of an atom is practically due to protons and neutrons alone. These are present in the nucleus of an atom. Hence protons and neutrons are also called nucleons. Therefore, the mass of an atom resides in its nucleus. For example, mass of carbon is 12 u because it has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, 6 u + 6 u = 12 u. Similarly, the mass of aluminium is 27 u (13 protons+14 neutrons). The mass number is defined as the sum of the total number of protons and neutrons present in the nucleus of an atom. It is denoted by ‘A’. In the notation for an atom, the atomic number, mass number and symbol of the element are to be written as: Mass Number Q Symbol of element Atomic Number For example, nitrogen is written as 14 7 N . uestions 1. If number of electrons in an atom is 8 and number of protons is also 8, then (i) what is the atomic number of the atom? and (ii) what is the charge on the atom? 2. With the help of Table 4.1, find out the mass number of oxygen and sulphur atom. 4.6 Isotopes In nature, a number of atoms of some elements have been identified, which have the same atomic number but different mass numbers. For example, take the case of hydrogen atom, it has three atomic species, namely protium (1 1H), deuterium ( 2 1 H or D) and tritium ( 3 1H or T). The atomic number of each one is 1, but the mass number is 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Other such examples are (i) carbon, 12 6 C and 14 6 C, (ii) chlorine, 35 17 Cl and 37 17 Cl, etc. On the basis of these examples, isotopes are defined as the atoms of the same element, having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. Therefore, we can say that there are three isotopes of hydrogen atom, namely protium, deuterium and tritium. Q X A Z Reprint 2025-26"}

The chemical properties of isotopes are similar but their physical properties are different. Chlorine occurs in nature in two isotopic forms, with masses 35 u and 37 u in the ratio of 3:1. Obviously, the question arises: what should we take as the mass of chlorine atom? Let us find out.

If an element has no isotopes, then the mass of its atom would be the same as the sum of protons and neutrons in it. But if an element occurs in isotopic forms, then we have to know the percentage of each isotopic form and then the average mass is calculated. This does not mean that any one atom of chlorine has a fractional mass of 35.5 u. It means that if you take a certain amount of chlorine, it will contain both isotopes of chlorine and the average mass is 35.5 u. Applications Since the chemical properties of all the isotopes of an element are the same, normally we are not concerned about taking a mixture. But some isotopes have special properties which find them useful in various fields. Some of them are : (i) An isotope of uranium is used as a fuel in nuclear reactors. (ii) An isotope of cobalt is used in the treatment of cancer. (iii) An isotope of iodine is used in the treatment of goitre. 4.6.1 ISOBARS Let us consider two elements — calcium, atomic number 20, and argon, atomic number 18. The number of protons in these atoms is different, but the mass number of both these elements is 40. That is, the total number of nucleons is the same in the atoms of this pair of elements.

Cell is a Latin word for ‘a little room’. This may seem to be a very small and insignificant incident but it is very important in the history of science. This was the very first time that someone had observed that living things appear to consist of separate units.

Together they form a big structure like an onion bulb! We find from this activity that onion bulbs of different sizes have similar small structures visible under a microscope. The cells of the onion peel will all look the same, regardless of the size of the onion they came from. These small structures that we see are the basic building units of the onion bulb. These structures are called cells. Not only onions, but all organisms that we observe around are made up of cells. However, there are also single cells that live on their own. Cells were first discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665. He observed the cells in a cork slice with the help of a primitive microscope. Leeuwenhoek (1674), with the improved microscope, discovered the free living cells in pond water for the first time. It was Robert Brown in 1831 who discovered the nucleus in the cell. Purkinje in 1839 coined the term ‘protoplasm’ for the fluid substance of the cell. The cell theory, that all the plants and animals are composed of cells and that the cell is the basic unit of life, was presented by two biologists, Schleiden (1838) and Schwann (1839). The cell theory was further expanded by Virchow (1855) by suggesting that all cells arise from pre-existing cells. With the discovery of the electron microscope in 1940, it was possible to observe and understand the complex structure of the cell and its various organelles.

Some cells like Amoeba have changing shapes. In some cases the cell shape could be more or less fixed and peculiar for a particular type of cell; for example, nerve cells have a typical shape. Each living cell has the capacity to perform certain basic functions that are characteristic of all living forms. How does a living cell perform these basic functions? We know that there is a division of labour in multicellular organisms such as human beings. This means that different parts of the human body perform different functions. The human body has a heart to pump blood, a stomach to digest food and so on. Similarly, division of labour is also seen within a single cell. In fact, each such cell has got certain specific components within it known as cell organelles. Each kind of cell organelle performs a special function, such as making new material in the cell, clearing up the waste material from the cell and so on. A cell is able to live and perform all its functions because of these organelles. These organelles together constitute the basic unit called the cell. It is interesting that all cells are found to have the same organelles, no matter what their function is or what organism they are found in. uestions 1. Who discovered cells, and how? 2. Why is the cell called the structural and functional unit of life? 5.2 What is a Cell Made Up of? What is the Structural Organisation of a Cell? We saw above that the cell has special components called organelles. How is a cell organised? If we study a cell under a microscope, we would come across three features in almost every cell; plasma membrane, nucleus and cytoplasm. All activities inside the cell and interactions of the cell with its environment are possible due to these features. Let us see how. 5.2.1 PLASMA MEMBRANE OR CELL MEMBRANE This is the outermost covering of the cell that separates the contents of the cell from its external environment. The plasma membrane allows or permits the entry and exit of some materials in and out of the cell. It also prevents movement of some other materials. The cell membrane, therefore, is called a selectively permeable membrane. How does the movement of substances take place into the cell? How do substances move out of the cell? Some substances like carbon dioxide or oxygen can move across the cell membrane by a process called diffusion. We have studied the process of diffusion in earlier chapters. We saw that there is spontaneous movement of a substance from a region of high concentration to a region where its concentration is low. Something similar to this happens in cells when, for example, some substance like CO2 (which is cellular waste and requires to be excreted out by the cell) accumulates in high concentrations inside the cell. In the cell’s external environment, the concentration of CO2 is low as compared to that inside the cell. As soon as there is a difference of concentration of CO2 inside and outside a cell, CO2 moves out of the cell, from a region of high concentration, to a region of low concentration outside the cell by the process of diffusion. Similarly, O2 enters the cell by the process of diffusion when the level or concentration of O2 inside the cell decreases. Thus, diffusion plays an important role in gaseous exchange between the cells as well as the cell and its external environment. Water also obeys the law of diffusion. The movement of water molecules through such a selectively permeable membrane is called osmosis. Q Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 9__science__p62__c1", "text": "SCIENCE 52 52 52 52 52 The movement of water across the plasma membrane is also affected by the amount of substance dissolved in water. Thus, osmosis is the net diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane toward a higher solute concentration. What will happen if we put an animal cell or a plant cell into a solution of sugar or salt in water? One of the following three things could happen: 1. If the medium surrounding the cell has a higher water concentration than the cell, meaning that the outside solution is very dilute, the cell will gain water by osmosis. Such a solution is known as a hypotonic solution. Water molecules are free to pass across the cell membrane in both directions, but more water will come into the cell than will leave. The net (overall) result is that water enters the cell. The cell is likely to swell up. 2. If the medium has exactly the same water concentration as the cell, there will be no net movement of water across the cell membrane. Such a solution is known as an isotonic solution. Water crosses the cell membrane in both directions, but the amount going in is the same as the amount going out, so there is no overall movement of water. The cell will stay the same size. 3. If the medium has a lower concentration of water than the cell, meaning that it is a very concentrated solution, the cell will lose water by osmosis. Such a solution is known as a hypertonic solution. Again, water crosses the cell membrane in both directions, but this time more water leaves the cell than enters it. Therefore the cell will shrink. Thus, osmosis is a special case of diffusion through a selectively permeable membrane. Now let us try out the following activity: Activity ______________ 5.3 (a) Remove the shell of an egg by dissolving it in dilute hydrochloric acid. The shell is mostly calcium carbonate. A thin outer skin now encloses the egg. Put the egg in pure water and observe after 5 minutes. What do we observe? The egg swells because water passes into it by osmosis. (b) Place a similar de-shelled egg in a concentrated salt solution and observe for 5 minutes. The egg shrinks. Why? Water passes out of the egg solution into the salt solution because the salt solution is more concentrated. We can also try a similar activity with dried raisins or apricots. Activity ______________ 5.4 • Put dried raisins or apricots in plain water and leave them for some time. Then place them into a concentrated solution of sugar or salt. You will observe the following: (a) Each gains water and swells when placed in water. (b) However, when placed in the concentrated solution it loses water, and consequently shrinks. Unicellular freshwater organisms and most plant cells tend to gain water through osmosis. Absorption of water by plant roots is also an example of osmosis. Thus, diffusion is important in exhange of gases and water in the life of a cell. In additions to this, the cell also obtains nutrition from its environment. Different molecules move in and out of the cell through a type of transport requiring use of energy. The plasma membrane is flexible and is made up of organic molecules called lipids and proteins. However, we can observe the structure of the plasma membrane only through an electron microscope. The flexibility of the cell membrane also enables the cell to engulf in food and other material from its external environment. Such processes are known as endocytosis. Amoeba acquires its food through such processes. Reprint 2025-26"}

Why is the plasma membrane called a selectively permeable membrane? 5.2.2 CELL WALL Plant cells, in addition to the plasma membrane, have another rigid outer covering called the cell wall. The cell wall lies outside the plasma membrane. The plant cell wall is mainly composed of cellulose. Cellulose is a complex substance and provides structural strength to plants. When a living plant cell loses water through osmosis there is shrinkage or contraction of the contents of the cell away from the cell wall. This phenomenon is known as plasmolysis. We can observe this phenomenon by performing the following activity: Activity ______________ 5.6 • Mount the peel of a Rhoeo leaf in water on a slide and examine cells under the high power of a microscope. Note the small green granules, called chloroplasts. They contain a green substance called chlorophyll. Put a strong solution of sugar or salt on the mounted leaf on the slide. Wait for a minute and observe under a microscope. What do we see? • Now place some Rhoeo leaves in boiling water for a few minutes. This kills the cells. Then mount one leaf on a slide and observe it under a microscope. Put a strong solution of sugar or salt on the mounted leaf on the slide. Wait for a minute and observe it again. What do we find? Did plasmolysis occur now? What do we infer from this activity? It appears that only living cells, and not dead cells, are able to absorb water by osmosis. Cell walls permit the cells of plants, fungi and bacteria to withstand very dilute (hypotonic) external media without bursting. In such media the cells tend to take up water by osmosis. The cell swells, building up pressure against the cell wall. The wall exerts an equal pressure against the swollen cell. Because of their walls, such cells can withstand much greater changes in the surrounding medium than animal cells. 5.2.3 NUCLEUS Remember the temporary mount of onion peel we prepared? We had put iodine solution on the peel. Why? What would we see if we tried observing the peel without putting the iodine solution? Try it and see what the difference is. Further, when we put iodine solution on the peel, did each cell get evenly coloured? According to their chemical composition different regions of cells get coloured differentially. Some regions appear darker than other regions. Apart from iodine solution we could also use safranin solution or methylene blue solution to stain the cells. We have observed cells from an onion; let us now observe cells from our own body. Activity ______________ 5.7 • Let us take a glass slide with a drop of water on it. Using an ice-cream spoon gently scrape the inside surface of the cheek. Does any material get stuck on the spoon? With the help of a needle we can transfer this material and spread it evenly on the glass slide kept ready for this. To colour the material we can put a drop of methylene blue solution on it. Now the material is ready for observation under microscope. Do not forget to put a cover-slip on it! • What do we observe? What is the shape of the cells we see? Draw it on the observation sheet.

{"id": "class 9__science__p64__c1", "text": "SCIENCE 54 • Was there a darkly coloured, spherical or oval, dot-like structure near the centre of each cell? This structure is called nucleus. Were there similar structures in onion peel cells? The nucleus has a double layered covering called nuclear membrane. The nuclear membrane has pores which allow the transfer of material from inside the nucleus to its outside, that is, to the cytoplasm (which we will talk about in section 5.2.4). The nucleus contains chromosomes, which are visible as rod-shaped structures only when the cell is about to divide. Chromosomes contain information for inheritance of characters from parents to next generation in the form of DNA (Deoxyribo Nucleic Acid) molecules. Chromosomes are composed of DNA and protein. DNA molecules contain the information necessary for constructing and organising cells. Functional segments of DNA are called genes. In a cell which is not dividing, this DNA is present as part of chromatin material. Chromatin material is visible as entangled mass of thread like structures. Whenever the cell is about to divide, the chromatin material gets organised into chromosomes. The nucleus plays a central role in cellular reproduction, the process by which a single cell divides and forms two new cells. It also plays a crucial part, along with the environment, in determining the way the cell will develop and what form it will exhibit at maturity, by directing the chemical activities of the cell. In some organisms like bacteria, the nuclear region of the cell may be poorly defined due to the absence of a nuclear membrane. Such an undefined nuclear region containing only nucleic acids is called a nucleoid. Such organisms, whose cells lack a nuclear membrane, are called prokaryotes (Pro = primitive or primary; karyote ≈ karyon = nucleus). Organisms with cells having a nuclear membrane are called eukaryotes. Prokaryotic cells (see Fig. 5.4) also lack most of the other cytoplasmic organelles present in eukaryotic cells. Many of the functions of such organelles are also performed by poorly organised parts of the cytoplasm (see section 5.2.4). The chlorophyll in photosynthetic prokaryotic bacteria is associated with membranous vesicles (bag like structures) but not with plastids as in eukaryotic cells (see section 5.2.5). Ribosomes Plasma membrane Cell wall Nucleoid Fig. 5.4: Prokaryotic cell 5.2.4 CYTOPLASM When we look at the temporary mounts of onion peel as well as human cheek cells, we can see a large region of each cell enclosed by the cell membrane. This region takes up very little stain. It is called the cytoplasm. The cytoplasm is the fluid content inside the plasma membrane. It also contains many specialised cell organelles. Each of these organelles performs a specific function for the cell. Cell organelles are enclosed by membranes. In prokaryotes, beside the absence of a defined nuclear region, the membrane-bound cell organelles are also absent. On the other hand, the eukaryotic cells have nuclear membrane as well as membrane-enclosed organelles. The significance of membranes can be illustrated with the example of viruses. Viruses lack any membranes and hence do not show characteristics of life until they enter a living body and use its cell machinery to multiply. Reprint 2025-26"}

Large and complex cells, including cells from multicellular organisms, need a lot of chemical activities to support their complicated structure and function. To keep these activities of different kinds separate from each other, these cells use membrane-bound little structures (or ‘organelles’) within themselves. This is one of the features of the eukaryotic cells that distinguish them from prokaryotic cells. Some of these organelles are visible only with an electron microscope. We have talked about the nucleus in a previous section. Some important examples of cell organelles which we will discuss now are: endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, mitochondria and plastids. They are important because they carry out some very crucial functions in cells. 5.2.5 (i) ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM (ER) The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a large network of membrane-bound tubes and sheets. It looks like long tubules or round or oblong bags (vesicles). The ER membrane is similar in structure to the plasma membrane. There are two types of ER– rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). RER looks rough under a microscope because it has particles called ribosomes attached to its surface. The ribosomes, which are present in all active cells, are the sites of protein manufacture. The manufactured proteins are then sent to various places in the cell depending on need, using the ER. The SER helps in the manufacture of fat molecules, or lipids, important for cell function. Some of these proteins and lipids help in building the cell membrane. This process is known as membrane biogenesis. Some other proteins and lipids function as enzymes and hormones. Although the ER varies greatly in appearance in different cells, it always forms a network system.

After graduating in 1865, he continued to work in Pavia at the Hospital of St. Matteo. At that time most of his investigations were concerned with the nervous system, In 1872 he accepted the post of Chief Medical Officer at the Hospital for the Chronically Sick at Abbiategrasso. He first started his investigations into the nervous system in a little kitchen of this hospital, which he had converted into a laboratory. However, the work of greatest importance, which Golgi carried out was a revolutionary method of staining individual nerve and cell structures. This method is referred to as the ‘black reaction’. This method uses a weak solution of silver nitrate and is particularly valuable in tracing the processes and most delicate ramifications of cells. All through his life, he continued to work on these lines, modifying and improving this technique. Golgi received the highest honours and awards in recognition of his work. He shared the Nobel prize in 1906 with Santiago Ramony Cajal for their work on the structure of the nervous system. 5.2.5 (iii) LYSOSOMES Structurally, lysosomes are membrane-bound sacs filled with digestive enzymes. These enzymes are made by RER. Lysosomes are a kind of waste disposal system of the cell. These help to keep the cell clean by digesting any foreign material as well as worn-out cell organelles. Foreign materials entering the cell, such as bacteria or food, as well as old organelles end up in the lysosomes, which break complex substances into simpler substances. Lysosomes are able to do this because they contain powerful digestive enzymes capable of breaking down all organic material. During the disturbance in cellular metabolism, for example, when the cell gets Fig. 5.6: Plant cell for some of the biochemical activities of the cell. In the liver cells of the group of animals called vertebrates (see Chapter 7), SER plays a crucial role in detoxifying many poisons and drugs. 5.2.5 (ii) GOLGI APPARATUS The Golgi apparatus, first described by Camillo Golgi, consists of a system of membrane-bound vesicles (flattened sacs) arranged approximately parallel to each other in stacks called cisterns. These membranes often have connections with the membranes of ER and therefore constitute another portion of a complex cellular membrane system. The material synthesised near the ER is packaged and dispatched to various targets inside and outside the cell through the Golgi apparatus. Its functions include the storage, modification and packaging of products in vesicles. In some cases, complex sugars may be made from simple sugars in the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is also involved in the formation of lysosomes [see 5.2.5 (iii)]. Reprint 2025-26"}

Therefore, lysosomes are also known as the ‘suicide bags’ of a cell. 5.2.5 (iv) MITOCHONDRIA Mitochondria are known as the powerhouses of the cell. Mitochondria have two membrane coverings. The outer membrane is porous while the inner membrane is deeply folded. These folds increase surface area for ATP- generating chemical reactions. The energy required for various chemical activities needed for life is released by mitochondria in the form of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) molecules. ATP is known as the energy currency of the cell. The body uses energy stored in ATP for making new chemical compounds and for mechanical work. Mitochondria are strange organelles in the sense that they have their own DNA and ribosomes. Therefore, mitochondria are able to make some of their own proteins. 5.2.5 (V) PLASTIDS Plastids are present only in plant cells. There are two types of plastids – chromoplasts (coloured plastids) and leucoplasts (white or colourless plastids). Chromoplasts containing the pigment chlorophyll are known as chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are important for photosynthesis in plants. Chloroplasts also contain various yellow or orange pigments in addition to chlorophyll. Leucoplasts are primarily organelles in which materials such as starch, oils and protein granules are stored. The internal organisation of the Chloroplast consists of numerous membrane layers embedded in a material called the stroma. These are similar to mitochondria in external structure. Like the mitochondria, plastids also have their own DNA and ribosomes. 5.2.5 (vi) VACUOLES Vacuoles are storage sacs for solid or liquid contents. Vacuoles are small sized in animal cells while plant cells have very large vacuoles. The central vacuole of some plant cells may occupy 50-90% of the cell volume. In plant cells vacuoles are full of cell sap and provide turgidity and rigidity to the cell. Many substances of importance in the life of the plant cell are stored in vacuoles. These include amino acids, sugars, various organic acids and some proteins. In single-celled organisms like Amoeba, the food vacuole contains the food items that the Amoeba has consumed. In some unicellular organisms, specialised vacuoles also play important roles in expelling excess water and some wastes from the cell. uestions 1.

Why are lysosomes known as suicide bags? 4. Where are proteins synthesised inside the cell? Each cell thus acquires its structure and ability to function because of the organisation of its membrane and organelles in specific ways. The cell thus has a basic structural organisation. This helps the cells to perform functions like respiration, obtaining nutrition, and clearing of waste material, or forming new proteins. Thus, the cell is the fundamental structural unit of living organisms. It is also the basic functional unit of life.

{"id": "class 9__science__p70__c1", "text": "From the last chapter, we recall that all living organisms are made of cells. In unicellular organisms, a single cell performs all basic functions. For example, in Amoeba, a single cell carries out movement, intake of food, gaseous exchange and excretion. But in multi- cellular organisms there are millions of cells. Most of these cells are specialised to carry out specific functions. Each specialised function is taken up by a different group of cells. Since these cells carry out only a particular function, they do it very efficiently. In human beings, muscle cells contract and relax to cause movement, nerve cells carry messages, blood flows to transport oxygen, food, hormones and waste material and so on. In plants, vascular tissues conduct food and water from one part of the plant to other parts. So, multi-cellular organisms show division of labour. Cells specialising in one function are often grouped together in the body. This means that a particular function is carried out by a cluster of cells at a definite place in the body. This cluster of cells, called a tissue, is arranged and designed so as to give the highest possible efficiency of function. Blood, phloem and muscle are all examples of tissues. A group of cells that are similar in structure and/or work together to achieve a particular function forms a tissue. 6.1 Are Plants and Animals Made of Same Types of Tissues? Let us compare their structure and functions. Do plants and animals have the same structure? Do they both perform similar functions? There are noticeable differences between the two. Plants are stationary or fixed – they don’t move. Since they have to be upright, they have a large quantity of supportive tissue. The supportive tissue generally has dead cells. Animals on the other hand move around in search of food, mates and shelter. They consume more energy as compared to plants. Most of the tissues they contain are living. Another difference between animals and plants is in the pattern of growth. The growth in plants is limited to certain regions, while this is not so in animals. There are some tissues in plants that divide throughout their life. These tissues are localised in certain regions. Based on the dividing capacity of the tissues, various plant tissues can be classified as growing or meristematic tissue and permanent tissue. Cell growth in animals is more uniform. So, there is no such demarcation of dividing and non- dividing regions in animals. The structural organisation of organs and organ systems is far more specialised and localised in complex animals than even in very complex plants. This fundamental difference reflects the different modes of life pursued by these two major groups of organisms, particularly in their different feeding methods. Also, they are differently adapted for a sedentary existence on one hand (plants) and active locomotion on the other (animals), contributing to this difference in organ system design. It is with reference to these complex animal and plant bodies that we will now talk about the concept of tissues in some detail. 6 TISSUES ISSUES ISSUES ISSUES ISSUES C hapter Reprint 2025-26"}

Which of the two onions has longer roots? Why? 2. Do the roots continue growing even after we have removed their tips? 3. Why would the tips stop growing in jar 2 after we cut them? The growth of plants occurs only in certain specific regions. This is because the dividing tissue, also known as meristematic tissue, is located only at these points. Depending on the region where they are present, meristematic tissues are classified as apical, lateral and intercalary (Fig. 6.2). New cells produced by meristem are initially like those of meristem itself, but as they grow and mature, their characteristics slowly change and they become differentiated as components of other tissues.

They take up a specific role and lose the ability to divide. As a result, they form a permanent tissue. This process of taking up a permanent shape, size, and a function is called differentiation. Differentiation leads to the development of various types of permanent tissues. 3. Can we think of reasons why there would be so many types of cells? • We can also try to cut sections of plant roots. We can even try cutting sections of root and stem of different plants. 6.2.2 (i) SIMPLE PERMANENT TISSUE A few layers of cells beneath the epidermis are generally simple permanent tissue. Parenchyma is the most common simple permanent tissue. It consists of relatively unspecialised cells with thin cell walls. They are living cells. They are usually loosely arranged, thus large spaces between cells (intercellular spaces) are found in this tissue (Fig. 6.4 a). This tissue generally stores food.

Such a parenchyma type is called aerenchyma. The flexibility in plants is due to another permanent tissue, collenchyma. It allows bending of various parts of a plant like tendrils and stems of climbers without breaking. It also provides mechanical support. We can find this tissue in leaf stalks below the epidermis.

This aids in protection against loss of water, mechanical injury and invasion by parasitic fungi. Since it has a protective role to play, cells of epidermal tissue form a continuous layer without intercellular spaces. Most epidermal cells are relatively flat. Often their outer and side walls are thicker than the inner wall. We can observe small pores here and there in the epidermis of the leaf. These pores are called stomata (Fig. 6.5). Stomata are enclosed by two kidney-shaped cells called guard cells. They are necessary for exchanging gases with the atmosphere.

Tracheids and vessels have thick walls, and many are dead cells when mature. Tracheids and vessels are tubular structures. This allows them to transport water and minerals vertically. The parenchyma stores food. Xylem fibres are mainly supportive in function. Phloem is made up of five types of cells: sieve cells, sieve tubes, companion cells, phloem fibres and the phloem parenchyma [Fig. 6.7 (d)]. Sieve tubes are tubular cells with perforated walls.

It is absorbed in the lungs and then is transported to all the body cells through blood. Why would cells need oxygen? The functions of mitochondria we studied earlier provide a clue to this question. Blood flows and carries various substances from one part of the body to the other. For example, it carries oxygen and food to all cells. It also collects wastes from all parts of the body and carries them to the liver and kidney for disposal. Blood and muscles are both examples of tissues found in our body. On the basis of the functions they perform we can think of different types of animal tissues, such as epithelial tissue, connective tissue, muscular tissue and nervous tissue. Blood is a type of connective tissue, and muscle forms muscular tissue. 6.3.1 EPITHELIAL TISSUE The covering or protective tissues in the animal body are epithelial tissues. Epithelium covers most organs and cavities within the body. It also forms a barrier to keep different body systems separate. The skin, the lining of the mouth, the lining of blood vessels, lung alveoli and kidney tubules are all made of epithelial tissue. Epithelial tissue cells are tightly packed and form a continuous sheet. They have only a small amount of cementing material between them and almost no intercellular spaces. Obviously, anything entering or leaving the body must cross at least one layer of epithelium. As a result, the permeability of the cells of various epithelia play an important role in regulating the exchange of materials between the body and the external environment and also between different parts of the body. Regardless of the type, all epithelium is usually separated from the underlying tissue by an extracellular fibrous basement membrane. Different epithelia (Fig. 6.9) show differing structures that correlate with their unique functions. For example, in cells lining blood vessels or lung alveoli, where transportation of substances occurs through a selectively permeable surface, there is a simple flat kind Reprint 2025-26"}

Simple squamous epithelial cells are extremely thin and flat and form a delicate lining. The oesophagus and the lining of the mouth are also covered with squamous epithelium. The skin, which protects the body, is also made of squamous epithelium. Skin epithelial cells are arranged in many layers to prevent wear and tear. Since they are arranged in a pattern of layers, the epithelium is called stratified squamous epithelium. Where absorption and secretion occur, as in the inner lining of the intestine, tall epithelial cells are present. This columnar (meaning ‘pillar-like’) epithelium facilitates movement across the epithelial barrier. In the respiratory tract, the columnar epithelial tissue also has cilia, which are hair-like projections on the outer surfaces of epithelial cells. These cilia can move, and their movement pushes the mucus forward to clear it. This type of epithelium is thus ciliated columnar epithelium. Cuboidal epithelium (with cube-shaped cells) forms the lining of kidney tubules and ducts of salivary glands, where it provides mechanical support. Epithelial cells often acquire additional specialisation as gland cells, which can secrete substances at the epithelial surface. Sometimes a portion of the epithelial tissue folds inward, and a multicellular gland is formed. This is glandular epithelium. 6.3.2 CONNECTIVE TISSUE Blood is a type of connective tissue. Why would it be called ‘connective’ tissue? A clue is provided in the introduction of this chapter! Now, let us look at this type of tissue in some more detail. The cells of connective tissue are loosely spaced and embedded in an intercellular matrix (Fig. 6.10). The matrix may be jelly like, fluid, dense or rigid. The nature of matrix differs in concordance with the function of the particular connective tissue.

The plasma contains proteins, salts and hormones. Blood flows and transports gases, digested food, hormones and waste materials to different parts of the body. Bone is another example of a connective tissue. It forms the framework that supports the body. It also anchors the muscles and supports the main organs of the body. It is a strong and nonflexible tissue (what would be the advantage of these properties for bone functions?). Bone cells are embedded in a hard matrix that is composed of calcium and phosphorus compounds. Two bones can be connected to each other by another type of connective tissue called the ligament. This tissue is very elastic. It has considerable strength. Ligaments contain very little matrix and connect bones with bones. Tendons connect muscles to bones and are another type of connective tissue. Tendons are fibrous tissue with great strength but limited flexibility. Another type of connective tissue, cartilage, has widely spaced cells. The solid matrix is composed of proteins and sugars. Cartilage smoothens bone surfaces at joints and is also present in the nose, ear, trachea and larynx. We can fold the cartilage of the ears, but we cannot bend the bones in our arms. Think of how the two tissues are different! Areolar connective tissue is found between the skin and muscles, around blood vessels and nerves and in the bone marrow. It fills the space inside the organs, supports internal organs and helps in repair of tissues. Where are fats stored in our body? Fat- storing adipose tissue is found below the skin and between internal organs. The cells of this tissue are filled with fat globules. Storage of fats also lets it act as an insulator. 6.3.3 MUSCULAR TISSUE Muscular tissue consists of elongated cells, also called muscle fibres. This tissue is responsible for movement in our body.

Atoms, molecules, planets, stars and galaxies are all in motion. We often perceive an object to be in motion when its position changes with time. However, there are situations where the motion is inferred through indirect evidences. For example, we infer the motion of air by observing the movement of dust and the movement of leaves and branches of trees. What causes the phenomena of sunrise, sunset and changing of seasons? Is it due to the motion of the earth? If it is true, why don’t we directly perceive the motion of the earth? An object may appear to be moving for one person and stationary for some other. For the passengers in a moving bus, the roadside trees appear to be moving backwards. A person standing on the road–side perceives the bus alongwith the passengers as moving. However, a passenger inside the bus sees his fellow passengers to be at rest. What do these observations indicate? Most motions are complex. Some objects may move in a straight line, others may take a circular path. Some may rotate and a few others may vibrate. There may be situations involving a combination of these. In this chapter, we shall first learn to describe the motion of objects along a straight line. We shall also learn to express such motions through simple equations and graphs. Later, we shall discuss ways of describing circular motion. Activity ______________ 7.1 • Discuss whether the walls of your classroom are at rest or in motion.

On the other hand, controlled motion can be a service to human beings such as in the generation of hydro-electric power. Do you feel the necessity to study the erratic motion of some objects and learn to control them? 7.1 Describing Motion We describe the location of an object by specifying a reference point. Let us understand this by an example. Let us assume that a school in a village is 2 km north of the railway station. We have specified the position of the school with respect to the railway station. In this example, the railway station is the reference point. We could have also chosen other reference points according to our convenience. Therefore, to describe the position of an object we need to specify a reference point called the origin. 7 MOTION OTION OTION OTION OTION C hapter Reprint 2025-26"}

Let A, B and C represent the position of the object at different instants. At first, the object moves through C and B and reaches A. Then it moves back along the same path and reaches C through B. are used to describe the overall motion of an object and to locate its final position with reference to its initial position at a given time.

Activity ______________ 7.4 • Automobiles are fitted with a device that shows the distance travelled. Such a device is known as an odometer. A car is driven from Bhubaneshwar to New Delhi. The difference between the final reading and the initial reading of the odometer is 1850 km. • Find the magnitude of the displacement between Bhubaneshwar and New Delhi by using the Road Map of India. The total path length covered by the object is OA + AC, that is 60 km + 35 km = 95 km. This is the distance covered by the object. To describe distance we need to specify only the numerical value and not the direction of motion. There are certain quantities which are described by specifying only their numerical values. The numerical value of a physical quantity is its magnitude. From this example, can you find out the distance of the final position C of the object from the initial position O? This difference will give you the numerical value of the displacement of the object from O to C through A. The shortest distance measured from the initial to the final position of an object is known as the displacement. Can the magnitude of the displacement be equal to the distance travelled by an object? Consider the example given in (Fig. 7.1). For motion of the object from O to A, the distance covered is 60 km and the magnitude of displacement is also 60 km. During its motion from O to A and back to B, the distance covered Fig. 7.1: Positions of an object on a straight line path = 60 km + 25 km = 85 km while the magnitude of displacement = 35 km. Thus, the magnitude of displacement (35 km) is not equal to the path length (85 km). Further, we will notice that the magnitude of the displacement for a course of motion may be zero but the corresponding distance covered is not zero. If we consider the object to travel back to O, the final position concides with the initial position, and therefore, the displacement is zero. However, the distance covered in this journey is OA + AO = 60 km + 60 km = 120 km. Thus, two different physical quantities—the distance and the displacement, MOTION 73 Reprint 2025-26"}

Let it travel 5 m in the first second, 5 m more in the next second, 5 m in the third second and 5 m in the fourth second. In this case, the object covers 5 m in each second. As the object covers equal distances in equal intervals of time, it is said to be in uniform motion. The time interval in this motion should be small. In our day-to-day life, we come across motions where objects cover unequal distances in equal intervals of time, for example, when a car is moving on a crowded street or a person is jogging in a park. These are some instances of non-uniform motion.

{"id": "class 9__science__p85__c1", "text": "MOTION 75 Look at the situations given in Fig. 7.2. If the bowling speed is 143 km h–1 in Fig. 7.2(a) what does it mean? What do you understand from the signboard in Fig. 7.2(b)? Different objects may take different amounts of time to cover a given distance. Some of them move fast and some move slowly. The rate at which objects move can be different. Also, different objects can move at the same rate. One of the ways of measuring the rate of motion of an object is to find out the distance travelled by the object in unit time. This quantity is referred to as speed. The SI unit of speed is metre per second. This is represented by the symbol m s–1 or m/s. The other units of speed include centimetre per second (cm s–1) and kilometre per hour (km h–1). To specify the speed of an object, we require only its magnitude. The speed of an object need not be constant. In most cases, objects will be in non-uniform motion. Therefore, we describe the rate of motion of such objects in terms of their average speed. The average speed of an object is obtained by dividing the total distance travelled by the total time taken. That is, average speed = Total distance travelled Total time taken If an object travels a distance s in time t then its speed v is, v = s t (7.1) Let us understand this by an example. A car travels a distance of 100 km in 2 h. Its average speed is 50 km h–1. The car might not have travelled at 50 km h–1 all the time. Sometimes it might have travelled faster and sometimes slower than this. Example 7.1 An object travels 16 m in 4 s and then another 16 m in 2 s. What is the average speed of the object? Solution: Total distance travelled by the object = 16 m + 16 m = 32 m Total time taken = 4 s + 2 s = 6 s Average speed = Total distance travelled Total time taken = 32 m 6 s = 5.33 m s–1 Therefore, the average speed of the object is 5.33 m s–1. 7.2.1 SPEED WITH DIRECTION The rate of motion of an object can be more comprehensive if we specify its direction of motion along with its speed. The quantity that specifies both these aspects is called velocity. Velocity is the speed of an object moving in a definite direction. The velocity of an object can be uniform or variable. It can be changed by changing the object’s speed, direction of motion or both. When an object is moving along a straight line at a variable speed, we can express the magnitude of its rate of motion in terms of average velocity. It is calculated in the same way as we calculate average speed. In case the velocity of the object is changing at a uniform rate, then average velocity is given by the arithmetic mean of initial velocity and final velocity for a given period of time. That is, average velocity = initial velocity + final velocity 2 Mathematically, v av = u + v 2 (7.2) where vav is the average velocity, u is the initial velocity and v is the final velocity of the object. Speed and velocity have the same units, that is, m s–1 or m/s. Activity ______________ 7.6 • Measure the time it takes you to walk from your house to your bus stop or the school.

In this case, the change in velocity of the object for any time interval is zero. However, in non-uniform motion, velocity varies with time.

That is, acceleration = change in velocity time taken If the velocity of an object changes from an initial value u to the final value v in time t, the acceleration a is, v – u a = t (7.3) This kind of motion is known as accelerated motion. The acceleration is taken to be positive if it is in the direction of velocity and negative when it is opposite to the direction of velocity. The SI unit of acceleration is m s–2 . If an object travels in a straight line and its velocity increases or decreases by equal amounts in equal intervals of time, then the acceleration of the object is said to be uniform. The motion of a freely falling body is an example of uniformly accelerated motion. On the other hand, an object can travel with non-uniform acceleration if its velocity changes at a non-uniform rate.

For example, in the telecast of a one-day cricket match, vertical bar graphs show the run rate of a team in each over. As you have studied in mathematics, a straight line graph helps in solving a linear equation having two variables. To describe the motion of an object, we can use line graphs. In this case, line graphs show dependence of one physical quantity, such as distance or velocity, on another quantity, such as time. 7.4.1 DISTANCE–TIME GRAPHS The change in the position of an object with time can be represented on the distance-time graph adopting a convenient scale of choice. In this graph, time is taken along the x–axis and distance is taken along the y-axis. Distance-time graphs can be employed under various conditions where objects move with uniform speed, non-uniform speed, remain at rest etc. Fig. 7.3: Fig. 7.3: Fig. 7.3: Fig. 7.3: Fig. 7.3: Distance-time graph of an object moving with uniform speed We know that when an object travels equal distances in equal intervals of time, it moves with uniform speed. This shows that the distance travelled by the object is directly proportional to time taken. Thus, for uniform speed, a graph of distance travelled against time is a straight line, as shown in Fig. 7.3. The portion OB of the graph shows that the distance is increasing at a uniform rate. Note that, you can also use the term uniform velocity in place of uniform speed if you take the magnitude of displacement equal to the distance travelled by the object along the y-axis. We can use the distance-time graph to determine the speed of an object. To do so, consider a small part AB of the distance-time graph shown in Fig 7.3. Draw a line parallel to the x-axis from point A and another line parallel to the y-axis from point B. These two lines meet each other at point C to form a triangle ABC. Now, on the graph, AC denotes the time interval (t2 – t1) while BC corresponds to the distance (s2 – s1). We can see from the graph that as the object moves from the point A to B, it covers a distance (s2 – s1) in time (t2 – t1).

Thus, the graph shown in Fig 7.4 represents motion with non-uniform speed. 7.4.2 VELOCITY-TIME GRAPHS The variation in velocity with time for an object moving in a straight line can be represented by a velocity-time graph. In this graph, time is represented along the x-axis and the velocity Fig. 7.4: Distance-time graph for a car moving with non-uniform speed Fig. 7.5: Velocity-time graph for uniform motion of a car is represented along the y-axis. If the object moves at uniform velocity, the height of its velocity-time graph will not change with time (Fig. 7.5). It will be a straight line parallel to the x-axis. Fig. 7.5 shows the velocity-time graph for a car moving with uniform velocity of 40 km h–1. We know that the product of velocity and time give displacement of an object moving with uniform velocity. The area enclosed by velocity-time graph and the time axis will be equal to the magnitude of the displacement. To know the distance moved by the car between time t1 and t2 using Fig. 7.5, draw perpendiculars from the points corresponding to the time t1 and t2 on the graph. The velocity of 40 km h–1 is represented by the height AC or BD and the time (t2 – t1) is represented by the length AB. So, the distance s moved by the car in time (t2 – t1) can be expressed as s = AC × CD = [(40 km h–1) × (t2 – t1) h] = 40 (t2– t1) km = area of the rectangle ABDC (shaded in Fig. 7.5). We can also study about uniformly accelerated motion by plotting its velocity– time graph. Consider a car being driven along a straight road for testing its engine. Suppose a person sitting next to the driver records its velocity after every 5 seconds by noting the reading of the speedometer of the car. The velocity of the car, in km h–1 as well as in m s–1, at different instants of time is shown in table 7.3.

Fig. 7.6: Velocity-time graph for a car moving with uniform accelerations. You can also determine the distance moved by the car from its velocity-time graph. The area under the velocity-time graph gives the distance (magnitude of displacement) moved by the car in a given interval of time. If the car would have been moving with uniform velocity, the distance travelled by it would be represented by the area ABCD under the graph (Fig. 7.6). Since the magnitude of the velocity of the car is changing due to acceleration, the distance s travelled by the car will be given by the area ABCDE under the velocity-time graph (Fig. 7.6). That is, s = area ABCDE = area of the rectangle ABCD + area of the triangle ADE = AB × BC + 1 2 (AD × DE) In the case of non-uniformly accelerated motion, velocity-time graphs can have any shape.

What is the quantity which is measured by the area occupied below the velocity-time graph? 7.5 Equations of Motion When an object moves along a straight line with uniform acceleration, it is possible to relate its velocity, acceleration during motion and the distance covered by it in a certain time interval by a set of equations known as the equations of motion. For convenience, a set of three such equations are given below: v = u + at (7.5) s = ut + ½ at2 (7.6) 2 as = v2 – u2 (7.7) where u is the initial velocity of the object which moves with uniform acceleration a for time t, v is the final velocity, and s is the distance travelled by the object in time t.

The change in the velocity could be due to change in its magnitude or the direction of the motion or both.

In order to keep himself on track, he quickly changes his speed at the corners. How many times will the athlete have to change his direction of motion, while he completes one round? It is clear that to move in a rectangular track once, he has to change his direction of motion four times. Now, suppose instead of a rectangular track, the athlete is running along a hexagonal shaped path ABCDEF, as shown in Fig. 7.8(b). In this situation, the athlete will have to change his direction six times while he completes one round. What if the track was not a hexagon but a regular octagon, with eight equal sides as shown by ABCDEFGH in Fig. 7.8(c)? It is observed that as the number of sides of the track increases the athelete has to take turns more and more often. What would happen to the shape of the track as we go on increasing the number of sides indefinitely? If you do this you will notice that the shape of the track approaches the shape of a circle and the length of each of the sides will decrease to a point. If the athlete moves with a velocity of constant magnitude along the circular path, the only change in his velocity is due to the change in the direction of motion. The motion of the athlete moving along a circular path is, therefore, an example of an accelerated motion. We know that the circumference of a circle of radius r is given by π 2 r . If the athlete takes t seconds to go once around the circular path of radius r, the speed v is given by π 2 r v = t (7.8) When an object moves in a circular path with uniform speed, its motion is called uniform circular motion.

Move the stone to describe a circular path with constant speed by holding the thread at the other end, as shown in Fig. 7.9. If you carefully note, on being released the stone moves along a straight line tangential to the circular path. This is because once the stone is released, it continues to move along the direction it has been moving at that instant. This shows that the direction of motion changed at every point when the stone was moving along the circular path. When an athlete throws a hammer or a discus in a sports meet, he/she holds the hammer or the discus in his/her hand and gives it a circular motion by rotating his/ her own body.

We saw that such a motion can be uniform or non-uniform. We have not yet discovered what causes the motion. Why does the speed of an object change with time? Do all motions require a cause? If so, what is the nature of this cause? In this chapter we shall make an attempt to quench all such curiosities. For many centuries, the problem of motion and its causes had puzzled scientists and philosophers. A ball on the ground, when given a small hit, does not move forever. Such observations suggest that rest is the “natural state” of an object. This remained the belief until Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton developed an entirely different approach to understand motion. In our everyday life we observe that some effort is required to put a stationary object into motion or to stop a moving object. We ordinarily experience this as a muscular effort and say that we must push or hit or pull on an object to change its state of motion. The concept of force is based on this push, hit or pull. Let us now ponder about a ‘force’. What is it? In fact, no one has seen, tasted or felt a force. However, we always see or feel the effect of a force. It can only be explained by describing what happens when a force is applied to an object. Pushing, hitting and pulling of objects are all ways of bringing objects in motion (Fig. 8.1). They move because we make a force act on them. From your studies in earlier classes, you are also familiar with the fact that a force can be used to change the magnitude of velocity of an object (that is, to make the object move faster or slower) or to change its direction of motion. We also know that a force can change the shape and size of objects (Fig. 8.2). (a) The trolley moves along the direction we push it.

This friction force arises between two surfaces in contact; in this case, between the bottom of the box and floor’s rough surface. It balances the pushing force and therefore the box does not move. In Fig. 8.4(b), the children push the box harder but the box still does not move. This is because the friction force still balances the pushing force. If the children push the box harder still, the pushing force becomes bigger than the friction force [Fig. 8.4(c)]. There is an unbalanced force. So the box starts moving. What happens when we ride a bicycle? When we stop pedalling, the bicycle begins to slow down. This is again because of the friction forces acting opposite to the direction of motion. In order to keep the bicycle moving, we have to start pedalling again. It thus appears that an object maintains its motion under the continuous application of an unbalanced force. However, it is quite incorrect. An object moves with a uniform velocity when the forces (pushing force and frictional force) acting on the object are balanced and there is no net external force on it. If an unbalanced force is applied on the object, there will be a change either in its speed or in the direction of its motion. Thus, to accelerate the motion of an object, an unbalanced force is required. And the change in its speed (or in the direction of motion) would continue as long as this unbalanced force is applied. However, if this force is 8.1 Balanced and Unbalanced Forces Fig. 8.3 shows a wooden block on a horizontal table. Two strings X and Y are tied to the two opposite faces of the block as shown. If we apply a force by pulling the string X, the block begins to move to the right. Similarly, if we pull the string Y, the block moves to the left. But, if the block is pulled from both the sides with equal forces, the block will not move. Such forces are called balanced forces and do not change the state of rest or of motion of an object. Now, let us consider a situation in which two opposite forces of different magnitudes pull the block. In this case, the block would begin to move in the direction of the greater force. Thus, the two forces are not balanced and the unbalanced force acts in the direction the block moves. This suggests that an unbalanced force acting on an object brings it in motion.

He observed that when a marble rolls down an inclined plane, its velocity increases [Fig. 8.5(a)]. In the next chapter, you will learn that the marble falls under the unbalanced force of gravity as it rolls down and attains a definite velocity by the time it reaches the bottom. Its velocity decreases when it climbs up as shown in Fig. 8.5(b). Fig. 8.5(c) shows a marble resting on an ideal frictionless plane inclined on both sides. Galileo argued that when the marble is released from left, it would roll down the slope and go up on the opposite side to the same height from which it was released. If the inclinations of the planes on both sides are equal then the marble will climb the same distance that it covered while rolling down. If the angle of inclination of the right-side plane were gradually decreased, then the marble would travel further distances till it reaches the original height. If the right-side plane were ultimately made horizontal (that is, the slope is reduced to zero), the marble would continue to travel forever trying to reach the same height that it was released from. The unbalanced forces on the marble in this case are zero. It thus suggests that an unbalanced (external) force is required to change the motion of the marble but no net force is needed to sustain the uniform motion of the marble. In practical situations it is difficult to achieve a zero unbalanced force. This is because of the presence of the frictional force acting opposite to the direction of motion. Thus, in practice the marble stops after travelling some distance. The effect of the frictional force may be minimised by using a smooth marble and a smooth plane and providing a lubricant on top of the planes. Fig. 8.5: (a) the downward motion; (b) the upward motion of a marble on an inclined plane; and (c) on a double inclined plane. Newton further studied Galileo’s ideas on force and motion and presented three fundamental laws that govern the motion of objects. These three laws are known as Newton’s laws of motion. The first law of motion is stated as: An object remains in a state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled to change that state by an applied force. In other words, all objects resist a change in their state of motion. In a qualitative way, the tendency of undisturbed objects to stay at rest or to keep moving with the same velocity is called inertia. This is why, the first law of motion is also known as the law of inertia. Certain experiences that we come across while travelling in a motorcar can be explained on the basis of the law of inertia. We tend to remain at rest with respect to the seat until the driver applies a braking force to stop the motorcar. With the application of brakes, the car slows down but our body tends to continue in the same state of motion because of its inertia. A sudden application of brakes may thus cause injury to us by impact Reprint 2025-26"}

Safety belts exert a force on our body to make the forward motion slower. An opposite experience is encountered when we are standing in a bus and the bus begins to move suddenly. Now we tend to fall backwards. This is because the sudden start of the bus brings motion to the bus as well as to our feet in contact with the floor of the bus. But the rest of our body opposes this motion because of its inertia. When a motorcar makes a sharp turn at a high speed, we tend to get thrown to one side. This can again be explained on the basis of the law of inertia. We tend to continue in our straight-line motion. When an unbalanced force is applied by the engine to change the direction of motion of the motorcar, we slip to one side of the seat due to the inertia of our body. The fact that a body will remain at rest unless acted upon by an unbalanced force can be illustrated through the following activities: Activity ______________ 8.1 • Make a pile of similar carom coins on a table, as shown in Fig. 8.6. • Attempt a sharp horizontal hit at the bottom of the pile using another carom coin or the striker. If the hit is strong enough, the bottom coin moves out quickly. Once the lowest coin is removed, the inertia of the other coins makes them ‘fall’ vertically on the table. Galileo Galilei was born on 15 February 1564 in Pisa, Italy. Galileo, right from his childhood, had interest in mathematics and natural philosophy. But his father Vincenzo Galilei wanted him to become a medical doctor. Accordingly, Galileo enrolled himself for a medical degree at the University of Pisa in 1581 which he never completed because of his real interest in mathematics. In 1586, he wrote his first scientific book ‘The Little Balance [La Balancitta]’, in which he described Archimedes’ method of finding the relative densities (or specific gravities) of substances using a balance. In 1589, in his series of essays – De Motu, he presented his theories about falling objects using an inclined plane to slow down the rate of descent. In 1592, he was appointed professor of mathematics at the University of Padua in the Republic of Venice. Here he continued his observations on the theory of motion and through his study of inclined planes and the pendulum, formulated the correct law for uniformly accelerated objects that the distance the object moves is proportional to the square of the time taken. Galileo was also a remarkable craftsman. He developed a series of telescopes whose optical performance was much better than that of other telescopes available during those days. Around 1640, he designed the first pendulum clock. In his book ‘Starry Messenger’ on his astronomical discoveries, Galileo claimed to have seen mountains on the moon, the milky way made up of tiny stars, and four small bodies orbiting Jupiter. In his books ‘Discourse on Floating Bodies’ and ‘Letters on the Sunspots’, he disclosed his observations of sunspots. Using his own telescopes and through his observations on Saturn and Venus, Galileo argued that all the planets must orbit the Sun and not the earth, contrary to what was believed at that time.

A force that is just enough to cause a small cart to pick up a large velocity will produce a negligible change in the motion of a train. This is because, in comparison to the cart the train has a much lesser tendency to change its state of motion. Accordingly, we say that the train has more inertia than the cart. Clearly, heavier or more massive objects offer larger inertia. Quantitatively, the inertia of an object is measured by its mass. We may thus relate inertia and mass as follows: Inertia is the natural tendency of an object to resist a change in its state of motion or of rest.

Observe that a groove is provided in a saucer for placing the tea cup.

If it is at rest it tends to remain at rest; if it is moving it tends to keep moving. This property of an object is called its inertia. Do all bodies have the same inertia? We know that it is easier to push an empty box than a box full of books. Similarly, if we kick a football it flies away. But if we kick a stone of the same size with equal force, it hardly moves. We may, in fact, get an injury in our foot while doing so! Similarly, in activity 8.2, instead of a Q Reprint 2025-26"}

We would now like to study how the acceleration of an object depends on the force applied to it and how we measure a force. Let us recount some observations from our everyday life. During the game of table tennis if the ball hits a player it does not hurt him. On the other hand, when a fast moving cricket ball hits a spectator, it may hurt him. A truck at rest does not require any attention when parked along a roadside. But a moving truck, even at speeds as low as 5 m s–1, may kill a person standing in its path. A small mass, such as a bullet may kill a person when fired from a gun. These observations suggest that the impact produced by the objects depends on their mass and velocity. Similarly, if an object is to be accelerated, we know that a greater force is required to give a greater velocity. In other words, there appears to exist some quantity of importance that combines the object’s mass and its velocity. One such property called momentum was introduced by Newton. The momentum, p of an object is defined as the product of its mass, m and velocity, v. That is, p = mv (8.1) Momentum has both direction and magnitude. Its direction is the same as that of velocity, v. The SI unit of momentum is kilogram-metre per second (kg m s-1). Since the application of an unbalanced force brings a change in the velocity of the object, it is therefore clear that a force also produces a change of momentum. Let us consider a situation in which a car with a dead battery is to be pushed along a straight road to give it a speed of 1 m s-1, which is sufficient to start its engine. If one or two persons give a sudden push (unbalanced force) to it, it hardly starts. But a continuous push over some time results in a gradual acceleration of the car to this speed. It means that the change of momentum of the car is not only determined by the magnitude of the force but also by the time during which the force is exerted. It may then also be concluded that the force necessary to change the momentum of an object depends on the time rate at which the momentum is changed. The second law of motion states that the rate of change of momentum of an object is proportional to the applied unbalanced force in the direction of force. 8.4.1 MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION OF SECOND LAW OF MOTION Suppose an object of mass, m is moving along a straight line with an initial velocity, u. It is uniformly accelerated to velocity, v in time, t by the application of a constant force, F throughout the time, t. The initial and final momentum of the object will be, p1 = mu and p2 = mv respectively. The change in momentum ∝p2 – p1 ∝mv – mu ∝m × (v – u). The rate of change of momentum ∝ ( ) × − m v u t Or, the applied force, F ∝ ( ) × − m v u t ( ) × − = km v u t F (8.2) = k m a (8.3) Here a ∝ = [(v – u)/t] is the acceleration, which is the rate of change of velocity. The quantity, k is a constant of proportionality. The SI units of mass and acceleration are kg and m s-2 respectively. The unit of force is so chosen that the value of the constant, k becomes one. For this, one unit of force is defined as the amount that produces an acceleration of 1 m s-2 in an object of 1 kg mass. That is, 1 unit of force = k × (1 kg) × (1 m s-2). Thus, the value of k becomes 1. From Eq. (8.3) F = ma (8.4) The unit of force is kg m s-2 or newton, which has the symbol N. The second law of Reprint 2025-26"}

The second law of motion is often seen in action in our everyday life. Have you noticed that while catching a fast moving cricket ball, a fielder in the ground gradually pulls his hands backwards with the moving ball? In doing so, the fielder increases the time during which the high velocity of the moving ball decreases to zero. Thus, the acceleration of the ball is decreased and therefore the impact of catching the fast moving ball (Fig. 8.8) is also reduced. If the ball is stopped suddenly then its high velocity decreases to zero in a very short interval of time. Thus, the rate of change of momentum of the ball will be large. Therefore, a large force would have to be applied for holding the catch that may hurt the palm of the fielder. In a high jump athletic event, the athletes are made to fall either on a cushioned bed or on a sand bed. This is to increase the time of the athlete’s fall to stop after making the jump. This decreases the rate of change of momentum and hence the force. Try to ponder how a karate player breaks a slab of ice with a single blow. The first law of motion can be mathematically stated from the mathematical expression for the second law of motion. Eq. (8.4) is F = ma or F ( ) − = m v u t (8.5) or Ft = mv – mu That is, when F = 0, v = u for whatever time, t is taken. This means that the object will continue moving with uniform velocity, u throughout the time, t. If u is zero then v will also be zero. That is, the object will remain at rest.

Find the magnitude of the applied force. Now, if the force was applied for a duration of 5 s, what would be the final velocity of the object? Solution: Solution: Solution: Solution: Solution: We have been given that u = 3 m s–1 and v = 7 m s-1, t = 2 s and m = 5 kg. From Eq.

Now, if this force is applied for a duration of 5 s (t = 5 s), then the final velocity can be calculated by rewriting Eq.

(8.4), we have F = ma. Here we have m1 = 2 kg; a1 = 5 m s-2 and m2 = 4 kg; a2 = 2 m s-2. Thus, F1 = m1a1 = 2 kg × 5 m s-2 = 10 N; and F2 = m2a2 = 4 kg × 2 m s-2 = 8 N. ⇒ F1 > F2. Thus, accelerating a 2 kg mass at 5 m s-2 would require a greater force. Example 8.3 A motorcar is moving with a velocity of 108 km/h and it takes 4 s to stop after the brakes are applied. Calculate the force exerted by the brakes on the motorcar if its mass along with the passengers is 1000 kg. Solution: The initial velocity of the motorcar u = 108 km/h = 108 × 1000 m/(60 × 60 s) = 30 m s-1 and the final velocity of the motorcar v = 0 m s-1. The total mass of the motorcar along with its passengers = 1000 kg and the time taken to stop the motorcar, t = 4 s. From Eq. (8.5) we have the magnitude of the force (F) applied by the brakes as m(v – u)/t. On substituting the values, we get F = 1000 kg × (0 – 30) m s-1/4 s = – 7500 kg m s-2 or – 7500 N. The negative sign tells us that the force exerted by the brakes is opposite to the direction of motion of the motorcar. Example 8.4 A force of 5 N gives a mass m1, an acceleration of 10 m s–2 and a mass m2, an acceleration of 20 m s-2. What acceleration would it give if both the masses were tied together? Solution: From Eq. (8.4) we have m1 = F/a1; and m2 = F/a2. Here, a1 = 10 m s-2; a2 = 20 m s-2 and F = 5 N. Thus, m1 = 5 N/10 m s-2 = 0.50 kg; and m2 = 5 N/20 m s-2 = 0.25 kg. If the two masses were tied together, the total mass, m would be m = 0.50 kg + 0.25 kg = 0.75 kg. The acceleration, a produced in the combined mass by the 5 N force would be, a = F/m = 5 N/0.75 kg = 6.67 m s-2. Example 8.5 The velocity-time graph of a ball of mass 20 g moving along a straight line on a long table is given in Fig. 8.9. Fig. 8.9 How much force does the table exert on the ball to bring it to rest? Solution: The initial velocity of the ball is 20 cm s-1. Due to the frictional force exerted by the table, the velocity of the ball decreases down to zero in 10 s. Thus, u = 20 cm s–1; v = 0 cm s-1 and t = 10 s. Since the velocity-time graph is a straight line, it is clear that the ball moves with a constant acceleration. The acceleration a is − = v u a t = (0 cm s-1 – 20 cm s-1)/10 s = –2 cm s-2 = –0.02 m s-2. Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 9__science__p105__c1", "text": "FORCE AND LAWS OF MOTION 95 The force exerted on the ball F is, F = ma = (20/1000) kg × (– 0.02 m s-2) = – 0.0004 N. The negative sign implies that the frictional force exerted by the table is opposite to the direction of motion of the ball. 8.5 Third Law of Motion The first two laws of motion tell us how an applied force changes the motion and provide us with a method of determining the force. The third law of motion states that when one object exerts a force on another object, the second object instantaneously exerts a force back on the first. These two forces are always equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. These forces act on different objects and never on the same object. In the game of football sometimes we, while looking at the football and trying to kick it with a greater force, collide with a player of the opposite team. Both feel hurt because each applies a force to the other. In other words, there is a pair of forces and not just one force. The two opposing forces are also known as action and reaction forces. Let us consider two spring balances connected together as shown in Fig. 8.10. The fixed end of balance B is attached with a rigid support, like a wall. When a force is applied through the free end of spring balance A, it is observed that both the spring balances show the same readings on their scales. It means that the force exerted by spring balance A on balance B is equal but opposite in direction to the force exerted by the balance B on balance A. Any of these two forces can be called as action and the other as reaction. This gives us an alternative statement of the third law of motion i.e., to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. However, it must be remembered that the action and reaction always act on two different objects, simultaneously. Fig. 8.10: Action and reaction forces are equal and opposite. Suppose you are standing at rest and intend to start walking on a road. You must accelerate, and this requires a force in accordance with the second law of motion. Which is this force? Is it the muscular effort you exert on the road? Is it in the direction we intend to move? No, you push the road below backwards. The road exerts an equal and opposite force on your feet to make you move forward. It is important to note that even though the action and reaction forces are always equal in magnitude, these forces may not produce accelerations of equal magnitudes. This is because each force acts on a different object that may have a different mass. When a gun is fired, it exerts a forward force on the bullet. The bullet exerts an equal and opposite force on the gun. This results in the recoil of the gun (Fig. 8.11). Since the gun has a much greater mass than the bullet, the acceleration of the gun is much less than the acceleration of the bullet. The third law of motion can also be illustrated when a sailor jumps out of a rowing boat. As the sailor jumps forward, the force on the boat moves it backwards (Fig. 8.12).

We have learnt that a force is needed to change the speed or the direction of motion of an object. We always observe that an object dropped from a height falls towards the earth. We know that all the planets go around the Sun. The moon goes around the earth. In all these cases, there must be some force acting on the objects, the planets and on the moon. Isaac Newton could grasp that the same force is responsible for all these. This force is called the gravitational force. In this chapter we shall learn about gravitation and the universal law of gravitation. We shall discuss the motion of objects under the influence of gravitational force on the earth. We shall study how the weight of a body varies from place to place. We shall also discuss the conditions for objects to float in liquids. 9.1 Gravitation We know that the moon goes around the earth. An object when thrown upwards, reaches a certain height and then falls downwards. It is said that when Newton was sitting under a tree, an apple fell on him. The fall of the apple made Newton start thinking. He thought that: if the earth can attract an apple, can it not attract the moon? Is the force the same in both cases? He conjectured that the same type of force is responsible in both the cases. He argued that at each point of its orbit, the moon falls towards the earth, instead of going off in a straight line. So, it must be attracted by the earth. But we do not really see the moon falling towards the earth. Let us try to understand the motion of the moon by recalling activity 7.11.

Fig. 9.1: A stone describing a circular path with a velocity of constant magnitude. Before the thread is released, the stone moves in a circular path with a certain speed and changes direction at every point. The change in direction involves change in velocity or acceleration. The force that causes this acceleration and keeps the body moving along the circular path is acting towards the centre. This force is called the centripetal (meaning ‘centre-seeking’) force. 9 GRAVITATION RAVITATION RAVITATION RAVITATION RAVITATION C hapter Reprint 2025-26"}

The force is along the line joining the centres of two objects. In the absence of this force, the stone flies off along a straight line. This straight line will be a tangent to the circular path. More to know Tangent to a circle A straight line that meets the circle at one and only one point is called a tangent to the circle. Straight line ABC is a tangent to the circle at point B. The motion of the moon around the earth is due to the centripetal force. The centripetal force is provided by the force of attraction of the earth. If there were no such force, the moon would pursue a uniform straight line motion. It is seen that a falling apple is attracted towards the earth. Does the apple attract the earth? If so, we do not see the earth moving towards an apple. Why? According to the third law of motion, the apple does attract the earth. But according to the second law of motion, for a given force, acceleration is inversely proportional to the mass of an object [Eq. (8.4)]. The mass of an apple is negligibly small compared to that of the earth. So, we do not see the earth moving towards the apple. Extend the same argument for why the earth does not move towards the moon. In our solar system, all the planets go around the Sun. By arguing the same way, we can say that there exists a force between the Sun and the planets. From the above facts Newton concluded that not only does the earth attract an apple and the moon, but all objects in the universe attract each other. This force of attraction between objects is called the gravitational force.

G 2 M g = R -11 2 -2 24 6 2 6.7 10 N m kg 6 10 kg = (6.4 10 m) × × × × = 9.8 m s–2. Thus, the value of acceleration due to gravity of the earth, g = 9.8 m s–2. 9.2.2 MOTION OF OBJECTS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF GRAVITATIONAL FORCE OF THE EARTH Let us do an activity to understand whether all objects hollow or solid, big or small, will fall from a height at the same rate. Activity 9.3 • Take a sheet of paper and a stone. Drop them simultaneously from the first floor of a building. Observe whether both of them reach the ground simultaneously. • We see that paper reaches the ground little later than the stone. This happens because of air resistance. The air offers resistance due to friction to the motion of the falling objects. The resistance offered by air to the paper is more than the resistance offered to the stone. If we do the experiment in a glass jar from which air has been sucked out, the paper and the stone would fall at the same rate. change in the velocity of falling objects? While falling, there is no change in the direction of motion of the objects. But due to the earth’s attraction, there will be a change in the magnitude of the velocity. Any change in velocity involves acceleration. Whenever an object falls towards the earth, an acceleration is involved. This acceleration is due to the earth’s gravitational force. Therefore, this acceleration is called the acceleration due to the gravitational force of the earth (or acceleration due to gravity). It is denoted by g. The unit of g is the same as that of acceleration, that is, m s–2. We know from the second law of motion that force is the product of mass and acceleration. Let the mass of the stone in activity 9.2 be m. We already know that there is acceleration involved in falling objects due to the gravitational force and is denoted by g. Therefore the magnitude of the gravitational force F will be equal to the product of mass and acceleration due to the gravitational force, that is, F = m g (9.6) From Eqs. (9.4) and (9.6) we have 2 = G × M m m g d or G 2 M g = d (9.7) where M is the mass of the earth, and d is the distance between the object and the earth. Let an object be on or near the surface of the earth. The distance d in Eq. (9.7) will be equal to R, the radius of the earth. Thus, for objects on or near the surface of the earth, G 2 M × m mg = R (9.8) G 2 M g = R (9.9) The earth is not a perfect sphere. As the radius of the earth increases from the poles to the equator, the value of g becomes greater at the poles than at the equator. For most Reprint 2025-26"}

(9.9), this acceleration experienced by an object is independent of its mass. This means that all objects hollow or solid, big or small, should fall at the same rate. According to a story, Galileo dropped different objects from the top of the Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy to prove the same. As g is constant near the earth, all the equations for the uniformly accelerated motion of objects become valid with acceleration a replaced by g. The equations are: v = u + at (9.10) s = ut + 1 2 at2 (9.11) v2 = u2 + 2as (9.12) where u and v are the initial and final velocities and s is the distance covered in time, t. In applying these equations, we will take acceleration, a to be positive when it is in the direction of the velocity, that is, in the direction of motion. The acceleration, a will be taken as negative when it opposes the motion. Example 9.2 A car falls off a ledge and drops to the ground in 0.5 s. Let g = 10 m s –2 (for simplifying the calculations). (i) What is its speed on striking the ground? (ii) What is its average speed during the 0.5 s? (iii) How high is the ledge from the ground? Solution: Time, t = ½ second Initial velocity, u = 0 m s–1 Acceleration due to gravity, g = 10 m s–2 Acceleration of the car, a = + 10 m s–2 (downward) (i) speed v = a t v = 10 m s–2 × 0.5 s = 5 m s–1 (ii) average speed= 2 u +v = (0 m s–1+ 5 m s–1)/2 = 2.5 m s–1 (iii) distance travelled, s = ½ a t2 = ½ × 10 m s–2 × (0.5 s)2 = ½ × 10 m s–2 × 0.25 s2 = 1.25 m Thus, (i) its speed on striking the ground = 5 m s–1 (ii) its average speed during the 0.5 s = 2.5 m s–1 (iii) height of the ledge from the ground = 1.25 m. Example 9.3 An object is thrown vertically upwards and rises to a height of 10 m. Calculate (i) the velocity with which the object was thrown upwards and (ii) the time taken by the object to reach the highest point.

We have also learnt that greater the mass, the greater is the inertia. It remains the same whether the object is on the earth, the moon or even in outer space. Thus, the mass of an object is constant and does not change from place to place. 9.4 Weight We know that the earth attracts every object with a certain force and this force depends on the mass (m) of the object and the acceleration due to the gravity (g). The weight of an object is the force with which it is attracted towards the earth. We know that F = m × a, (9.13) that is, F = m × g. (9.14) The force of attraction of the earth on an object is known as the weight of the object. It is denoted by W. Substituting the same in Eq. (9.14), we have W = m × g (9.15) As the weight of an object is the force with which it is attracted towards the earth, the SI unit of weight is the same as that of force, that is, newton (N). The weight is a force acting vertically downwards; it has both magnitude and direction. We have learnt that the value of g is constant at a given place. Therefore at a given place, the weight of an object is directly proportional to the mass, say m, of the object, that is, W ∝ m. It is due to this reason that at a given place, we can use the weight of an object as a measure of its mass. The mass of an object remains the same everywhere, that is, on the earth and on any planet whereas its weight depends on its location because g depends on location. 9.4.1 WEIGHT OF AN OBJECT ON THE MOON We have learnt that the weight of an object on the earth is the force with which the earth attracts the object. In the same way, the weight of an object on the moon is the force with which the moon attracts that object. The mass of the moon is less than that of the earth. Due to this the moon exerts lesser force of attraction on objects. Let the mass of an object be m. Let its weight on the moon be Wm. Let the mass of the moon be Mm and its radius be Rm. By applying the universal law of gravitation, the weight of the object on the moon will be 2 G × = m m m M m W R (9.16) Let the weight of the same object on the earth be We.

Why an army tank weighing more than a thousand tonne rests upon a continuous chain? Why a truck or a motorbus has much wider tyres? Why cutting tools have sharp edges? In order to address these questions and understand the phenomena involved, it helps to introduce the concepts of the net force in a particular direction (thrust) and the force per unit area (pressure) acting on the object concerned. Let us try to understand the meanings of thrust and pressure by considering the following situations: Situation 1: You wish to fix a poster on a bulletin board, as shown in Fig 9.3. To do this task you will have to press drawing pins with your thumb. You apply a force on the surface area of the head of the pin. This force is directed perpendicular to the surface area of the board. This force acts on a smaller area at the tip of the pin. Q Fig. 9.3: To fix a poster, drawing pins are pressed with the thumb perpendicular to the board. Situation 2: You stand on loose sand. Your feet go deep into the sand. Now, lie down on the sand. You will find that your body will not go that deep in the sand. In both cases the force exerted on the sand is the weight of your body. Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 9__science__p117__c1", "text": "GRAVITATION 107 You have learnt that weight is the force acting vertically downwards. Here the force is acting perpendicular to the surface of the sand. The force acting on an object perpendicular to the surface is called thrust. When you stand on loose sand, the force, that is, the weight of your body is acting on an area equal to area of your feet. When you lie down, the same force acts on an area equal to the contact area of your whole body, which is larger than the area of your feet. Thus, the effects of forces of the same magnitude on different areas are different. In the above cases, thrust is the same. But effects are different. Therefore the effect of thrust depends on the area on which it acts. The effect of thrust on sand is larger while standing than while lying. The thrust on unit area is called pressure. Thus, thrust Pressure= area (9.20) Substituting the SI unit of thrust and area in Eq. (9.20), we get the SI unit of pressure as N/ m2 or N m–2. In honour of scientist Blaise Pascal, the SI unit of pressure is called pascal, denoted as Pa. Let us consider a numerical example to understand the effects of thrust acting on different areas. Example 9.6 A block of wood is kept on a tabletop. The mass of wooden block is 5 kg and its dimensions are 40 cm × 20 cm × 10 cm. Find the pressure exerted by the wooden block on the table top if it is made to lie on the table top with its sides of dimensions (a) 20 cm × 10 cm and (b) 40 cm × 20 cm. Solution: The mass of the wooden block = 5 kg The dimensions = 40 cm × 20 cm × 10 cm Here, the weight of the wooden block applies a thrust on the table top. That is, Thrust = F = m × g = 5 kg × 9.8 m s–2 = 49 N Area of a side = length × breadth = 20 cm × 10 cm = 200 cm2 = 0.02 m2 From Eq. (9.20), Pressure = 2 49N 0.02m = 2450 N m-2. When the block lies on its side of dimensions 40 cm × 20 cm, it exerts the same thrust. Area= length × breadth = 40 cm × 20 cm = 800 cm2 = 0.08 m2 From Eq. (9.20), Pressure = 2 49 N 0.08 m = 612.5 N m–2 The pressure exerted by the side 20 cm × 10 cm is 2450 N m–2 and by the side 40 cm × 20 cm is 612.5 N m–2. Thus, the same force acting on a smaller area exerts a larger pressure, and a smaller pressure on a larger area. This is the reason why a nail has a pointed tip, knives have sharp edges and buildings have wide foundations. 9.5.1 PRESSURE IN FLUIDS All liquids and gases are fluids.

To keep the bottle completely immersed, the upward force on the bottle due to water must be balanced. This can be achieved by an externally applied force acting downwards. This force must at least be equal to the difference between the upward force and the weight of the bottle. The upward force exerted by the water on the bottle is known as upthrust or buoyant force. In fact, all objects experience a force of buoyancy when they are immersed in a fluid. The magnitude of this buoyant force depends on the density of the fluid. 9.5.3 WHY OBJECTS FLOAT OR SINK WHEN PLACED ON THE SURFACE OF WATER? Let us do the following activities to arrive at an answer for the above question. Activity ______________ 9.5 • Take a beaker filled with water. • Take an iron nail and place it on the surface of the water. • Observe what happens. The nail sinks. The force due to the gravitational attraction of the earth on the iron nail pulls it downwards. There is an upthrust of water on the nail, which pushes it upwards. But the downward force acting on the nail is greater than the upthrust of water on the nail. So it sinks (Fig. 9.5). exert pressure on the base and walls of the container in which they are enclosed. Pressure exerted in any confined mass of fluid is transmitted undiminished in all directions. 9.5.2 BUOYANCY Have you ever had a swim in a pool and felt lighter? Have you ever drawn water from a well and felt that the bucket of water is heavier when it is out of the water? Have you ever wondered why a ship made of iron and steel does not sink in sea water, but while the same amount of iron and steel in the form of a sheet would sink? These questions can be answered by taking buoyancy in consideration. Let us understand the meaning of buoyancy by doing an activity. Activity ______________ 9.4 • Take an empty plastic bottle. Close the mouth of the bottle with an airtight stopper. Put it in a bucket filled with water. You see that the bottle floats. • Push the bottle into the water. You feel an upward push. Try to push it further down. You will find it difficult to push deeper and deeper. This indicates that water exerts a force on the bottle in the upward direction. The upward force exerted by the water goes on increasing as the bottle is pushed deeper till it is completely immersed. • Now, release the bottle. It bounces back to the surface. • Does the force due to the gravitational attraction of the earth act on this bottle? If so, why doesn’t the bottle stay immersed in water after it is released? How can you immerse the bottle in water? The force due to the gravitational attraction of the earth acts on the bottle in the downward direction. So the bottle is pulled downwards. But the water exerts an upward force on the bottle. Thus, the bottle is pushed upwards. We have learnt that weight of an object is the force due to gravitational attraction of the earth. When the bottle is immersed, the upward force exerted by the Fig. 9.5: An iron nail sinks and a cork floats when placed on the surface of water. Reprint 2025-26"}

You will find that the elongation of the string or the reading of the balance decreases as the stone is gradually lowered in the water. However, no further change is observed once the stone gets fully immersed in the water. What do you infer from the decrease in the extension of the string or the reading of the spring balance? We know that the elongation produced in the string or the spring balance is due to the weight of the stone. Since the extension decreases once the stone is lowered in water, it means that some force acts on the stone in upward direction. As a result, the net force on the string decreases and hence the elongation also decreases. As discussed earlier, this upward force exerted by water is known as the force of buoyancy. What is the magnitude of the buoyant force experienced by a body? Is it the same in all fluids for a given body? Do all bodies in a given fluid experience the same buoyant force? The answer to these questions is contained in Archimedes’ principle, stated as follows: Activity ______________ 9.6 • Take a beaker filled with water. • Take a piece of cork and an iron nail of equal mass. • Place them on the surface of water. • Observe what happens. The cork floats while the nail sinks. This happens because of the difference in their densities. The density of a substance is defined as the mass per unit volume. The density of cork is less than the density of water. This means that the upthrust of water on the cork is greater than the weight of the cork. So it floats (Fig. 9.5). The density of an iron nail is more than the density of water. This means that the upthrust of water on the iron nail is less than the weight of the nail. So it sinks. Therefore objects of density less than that of a liquid float on the liquid. The objects of density greater than that of a liquid sink in the liquid. uestions 1.

The law applies to objects anywhere in the universe. Such a law is said to be universal. • Gravitation is a weak force unless large masses are involved. • The force of gravity decreases with altitude. It also varies on the surface of the earth, decreasing from poles to the equator. • The weight of a body is the force with which the earth attracts it. • The weight is equal to the product of mass and acceleration due to gravity. • The weight may vary from place to place but the mass stays constant. When a body is immersed fully or partially in a fluid, it experiences an upward force that is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by it. Now, can you explain why a further decrease in the elongation of the string was not observed in activity 9.7, as the stone was fully immersed in water? Archimedes was a Greek scientist. He discovered the principle, subsequently named after him, after noticing that the water in a bathtub overflowed when he stepped into it. He ran through the streets shouting “Eureka!”, which means “I have got it”. This knowledge helped him to determine the purity of the gold in the crown made for the king. His work in the field of Geometry and Mechanics made him famous. His understanding of levers, pulleys, wheels- and-axle helped the Greek army in its war with Roman army.

Another concept that helps us understand and interpret many natural phenomena is ‘work’. Closely related to work are energy and power. In this chapter we shall study these concepts. All living beings need food. Living beings have to perform several basic activities to survive. We call such activities ‘life processes’. The energy for these processes comes from food. We need energy for other activities like playing, singing, reading, writing, thinking, jumping, cycling and running. Activities that are strenuous require more energy. Animals too get engaged in activities. For example, they may jump and run. They have to fight, move away from enemies, find food or find a safe place to live. Also, we engage some animals to lift weights, carry loads, pull carts or plough fields. All such activities require energy. Think of machines. List the machines that you have come across. What do they need for their working? Why do some engines require fuel like petrol and diesel? Why do living beings and machines need energy? 10.1 Work What is work? There is a difference in the way we use the term ‘work’ in day-to-day life and the way we use it in science. To make this point clear let us consider a few examples. 10.1.1 NOT MUCH ‘WORK’ IN SPITE OF WORKING HARD! Kamali is preparing for examinations. She spends lot of time in studies. She reads books, draws diagrams, organises her thoughts, collects question papers, attends classes, discusses problems with her friends, and performs experiments. She expends a lot of energy on these activities. In common parlance, she is ‘working hard’. All this ‘hard work’ may involve very little ‘work’ if we go by the scientific definition of work. You are working hard to push a huge rock. Let us say the rock does not move despite all the effort. You get completely exhausted. However, you have not done any work on the rock as there is no displacement of the rock. You stand still for a few minutes with a heavy load on your head. You get tired. You have exerted yourself and have spent quite a bit of your energy. Are you doing work on the load? The way we understand the term ‘work’ in science, work is not done. You climb up the steps of a staircase and reach the second floor of a building just to see the landscape from there. You may even climb up a tall tree. If we apply the scientific definition, these activities involve a lot of work. In day-to-day life, we consider any useful physical or mental labour as work. Activities like playing in a field, talking with friends, humming a tune, watching a movie, attending a function are sometimes not considered to be work. What constitutes ‘work’ depends on the way we define it. We use and define the term work differently in science. To understand this let us do the following activities: Activity _____________10.1 • We have discussed in the above paragraphs a number of activities which we normally consider to be work 10 WORK ORK ORK ORK ORK AND AND AND AND AND E E E E ENERGY NERGY NERGY NERGY NERGY C hapter Reprint 2025-26"}

To understand this, we shall first consider the case when the force is acting in the direction of displacement. Let a constant force, F act on an object. Let the object be displaced through a distance, s in the direction of the force (Fig. 10.1). Let W be the work done. We define work to be equal to the product of the force and displacement. Work done = force × displacement W = F s (10.1) in day-to-day life. For each of these activities, ask the following questions and answer them: (i) What is the work being done on? (ii) What is happening to the object? (iii) Who (what) is doing the work? 10.1.2SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTION OF WORK To understand the way we view work and define work from the point of view of science, let us consider some situations: Push a pebble lying on a surface. The pebble moves through a distance. You exerted a force on the pebble and the pebble got displaced. In this situation work is done. A girl pulls a trolley and the trolley moves through a distance. The girl has exerted a force on the trolley and it is displaced. Therefore, work is done. Lift a book through a height. To do this you must apply a force. The book rises up. There is a force applied on the book and the book has moved. Hence, work is done. A closer look at the above situations reveals that two conditions need to be satisfied for work to be done: (i) a force should act on an object, and (ii) the object must be displaced. If any one of the above conditions does not exist, work is not done. This is the way we view work in science. A bullock is pulling a cart. The cart moves. There is a force on the cart and the cart has moved. Do you think that work is done in this situation? Activity _____________10.2 • Think of some situations from your daily life involving work. • List them. • Discuss with your friends whether work is being done in each situation. • Try to reason out your response. • If work is done, which is the force acting on the object? • What is the object on which the work is done? • What happens to the object on which work is done? Fig. 10.1 Thus, work done by a force acting on an object is equal to the magnitude of the force multiplied by the distance moved in the direction of the force. Work has only magnitude and no direction. In Eq. (10.1), if F = 1 N and s = 1 m then the work done by the force will be 1 N m. Here the unit of work is newton metre (N m) or joule (J). Thus 1 J is the amount of work Reprint 2025-26"}

What is the work done when the force on the object is zero? What would be the work done when the displacement of the object is zero? Refer to the conditions that are to be satisfied to say that work is done. Example 10.1 A force of 5 N is acting on an object. The object is displaced through 2 m in the direction of the force (Fig. 10.2). If the force acts on the object all through the displacement, then work done is 5 N × 2 m =10 N m or 10 J. Fig. 10.4 Consider a situation in which an object is moving with a uniform velocity along a particular direction. Now a retarding force, F, is applied in the opposite direction. That is, the angle between the two directions is 180º. Let the object stop after a displacement s. In such a situation, the work done by the force, F is taken as negative and denoted by the minus sign. The work done by the force is F × (–s) or (–F × s). It is clear from the above discussion that the work done by a force can be either positive or negative. To understand this, let us do the following activity: Activity _____________10.4 • Lift an object up. Work is done by the force exerted by you on the object. The object moves upwards. The force you exerted is in the direction of displacement. However, there is the force of gravity acting on the object. • Which one of these forces is doing positive work? • Which one is doing negative work? • Give reasons. Work done is negative when the force acts opposite to the direction of displacement. Work done is positive when the force is in the direction of displacement. Example 10.2 A porter lifts a luggage of 15 kg from the ground and puts it on his head 1.5 m above the ground. Calculate the work done by him on the luggage. Solution: Mass of luggage, m = 15 kg and displacement, s = 1.5 m. Fig. 10.2 uestion 1. A force of 7 N acts on an object. The displacement is, say 8 m, in the direction of the force (Fig. 10.3). Let us take it that the force acts on the object through the displacement. What is the work done in this case? Fig. 10.3 Consider another situation in which the force and the displacement are in the same direction: a baby pulling a toy car parallel to the ground, as shown in Fig. 10.4. The baby has exerted a force in the direction of displacement of the car. In this situation, the work done will be equal to the product of the force and displacement. In such situations, the work done by the force is taken as positive. Q Reprint 2025-26"}

We have also observed children winding a toy (such as a toy car) and when the toy is placed on the floor, it starts moving. When a balloon is filled with air and we press it we notice a change in its shape. As long as we press it gently, it can come back to its original shape when the force is withdrawn. However, if we press the balloon hard, it can even explode producing a blasting sound. In all these examples, the objects acquire, through different means, the capability of doing work. An object having a capability to do work is said to possess energy. The object which does the work loses energy and the object on which the work is done gains energy. How does an object with energy do work? An object that possesses energy can exert a force on another object. When this happens, energy is transferred from the former to the latter. The second object may move as it receives energy and therefore do some work. Thus, the first object had a capacity to do work. This implies that any object that possesses energy can do work. The energy possessed by an object is thus measured in terms of its capacity of doing work. The unit of energy is, therefore, the same as that of work, that is, joule (J). 1 J is the energy required to do 1 joule of work. Sometimes a larger unit of energy called kilo joule (kJ) is used. 1 kJ equals 1000 J. 10.2.1 FORMS OF ENERGY Luckily the world we live in provides energy in many different forms.

We studied three equations of motion. The relation connecting the initial velocity (u) and final velocity (v) of an object moving with a uniform acceleration a, and the displacement, s is v2 – u2 = 2a s This gives 2 2 v – u s = 2a (10.2) From section 9.4, we know F = m a.

{"id": "class 9__science__p130__c1", "text": "SCIENCE 120 10.2.4 POTENTIAL ENERGY OF AN OBJECT AT A HEIGHT An object increases its energy when raised through a height. This is because work is done on it against gravity while it is being raised. The energy present in such an object is the gravitational potential energy. The gravitational potential energy of an object at a point above the ground is defined as the work done in raising it from the ground to that point against gravity. It is easy to arrive at an expression for the gravitational potential energy of an object at a height. Fig. 10.7 Consider an object of mass, m. Let it be raised through a height, h from the ground. A force is required to do this. The minimum force required to raise the object is equal to the weight of the object, mg. The object gains energy equal to the work done on it. Let the work done on the object against gravity be W. That is, work done, W = force × displacement = mg × h = mgh Since work done on the object is equal to mgh, an energy equal to mgh units is gained by the object. This is the potential energy (EP) of the object. Ep = mgh (10.6) More to know The potential energy of an object at a height depends on the ground level or the zero level you choose. An object in a given position can have a certain potential energy with respect to one level and a different value of potential energy with respect to another level. It is useful to note that the work done by gravity depends on the difference in vertical heights of the initial and final positions of the object and not on the path along which the object is moved. Fig. 10.8 shows a case where a block is raised from position A to B by taking two different paths. Let the height AB = h. In both the situations the work done on the object is mgh. Fig. 10.8 Example 10.5 Find the energy possessed by an object of mass 10 kg when it is at a height of 6 m above the ground. Given, g = 9.8 m s–2. Solution: Mass of the object, m = 10 kg, displacement (height), h = 6 m, and acceleration due to gravity, g = 9.8 m s–2. From Eq. (10.6), Potential energy = mgh = 10 kg × 9.8 m s–2 × 6 m = 588 J.

We find in nature a number of instances of conversion of energy from one form to another.

(b) Where do they get their energy from? (c) Why does the air move from place to place? (d) How are fuels, such as coal and petroleum formed? (e) What kinds of energy conversions sustain the water cycle? Activity ___________ 10.14 • Many of the human activities and the gadgets we use involve conversion of energy from one form to another. • Make a list of such activities and gadgets. • Identify in each activity/gadget the kind of energy conversion that takes place. 10.2.6 LAW OF CONSERVATION OF ENERGY In activities 10.13 and 10.14, we learnt that the form of energy can be changed from one form to another. What happens to the total energy of a system during or after the process? Whenever energy gets transformed, the total energy remains unchanged. This is the law of conservation of energy. According to this law, energy can only be converted from one form to another; it can neither be created or destroyed. The total energy before and after the transformation remains the same. The law of conservation of energy is valid in all situations and for all kinds of transformations. Consider a simple example. Let an object of mass, m be made to fall freely from a height, h. At the start, the potential energy is mgh and kinetic energy is zero. Why is the kinetic energy zero? It is zero because its velocity is zero. The total energy of the object is thus mgh. As it falls, its potential energy will change into kinetic energy. If v is the velocity of the object at a given instant, the kinetic energy would be ½mv2. As the fall of the object continues, the potential energy would decrease while the kinetic energy would increase. When the object is about to reach the ground, h = 0 and v will be the highest. Therefore, the kinetic energy would be the largest and potential energy the least. However, the sum of the potential energy and kinetic energy of the object would be the same at all points. That is, potential energy + kinetic energy = constant or 1 constant. 2 2 mgh + mv = (10.7) The sum of kinetic energy and potential energy of an object is its total mechanical energy. We find that during the free fall of the object, the decrease in potential energy, at any point in its path, appears as an equal amount of increase in kinetic energy. (Here the effect of air resistance on the motion of the object has been ignored.) There is thus a continual transformation of gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy. Reprint 2025-26"}

A more powerful vehicle would complete a journey in a shorter time than a less powerful one. We talk of the power of machines like motorbikes and motorcars. The speed with which these vehicles change energy or do work is a basis for their classification. Power measures the speed of work done, that is, how fast or slow work is done. Power is defined as the rate of doing work or the rate of transfer of energy. If an agent does a work W in time t, then power is given by: Power = work/time or W P = t (10.8) The unit of power is watt [in honour of James Watt (1736 – 1819)] having the symbol W. 1 watt is the power of an agent, which does work at the rate of 1 joule per second. We can also say that power is 1 W when the rate of consumption of energy is 1 J s–1. 1 watt = 1 joule/second or 1 W = 1 J s–1. We express larger rates of energy transfer in kilowatts (kW). 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts 1 kW = 1000 W 1 kW = 1000 J s–1. The power of an agent may vary with time. This means that the agent may be doing work at different rates at different intervals of time. Therefore the concept of average power is useful. We obtain average power by dividing the total energy consumed by the total time taken. Example 10.7 Two girls, each of weight 400 N climb up a rope through a height of 8 m. We name one of the girls A and the other B. Girl A takes 20 s while B takes 50 s to accomplish this task. What is the power expended by each girl?

There are also other forms of energy like mechanical energy, light energy, etc. We have talked about mechanical energy in the previous chapters. You have been taught about conservation of energy, which states that we can neither create nor destroy energy. We can just change it from one form to another. When you clap, a sound is produced. Can you produce sound without utilising your energy? Which form of energy did you use to produce sound? In this chapter we are going to learn how sound is produced and how it is transmitted through a medium and received by our ears. 11.1 Production of Sound Activity _____________11.1 • Take a tuning fork and set it vibrating by striking its prong on a rubber pad. Bring it near your ear. • Do you hear any sound? • Touch one of the prongs of the vibrating tuning fork with your finger and share your experience with your friends. • Now, suspend a table tennis ball or a small plastic ball by a thread from a support [Take a big needle and a thread, put a knot at one end of the thread, and then with the help of the needle pass the thread through the ball]. Touch the ball gently with the prong of a vibrating tuning fork (Fig. 11.1). • Observe what happens and discuss with your friends.

A particle of the medium in contact with the vibrating object is first displaced from its equilibrium position. It then exerts a force on the adjacent particle. As a result of which the adjacent particle gets displaced from its position of rest. After displacing the adjacent particle the first particle comes back to its original position. This process continues in the medium till the sound reaches your ear. The disturbance created by a source of sound in the medium travels through the medium and not the particles of the medium. A wave is a disturbance that moves through a medium when the particles of the medium set neighbouring particles into motion. They in turn produce similar motion in others. The particles of the medium do not move forward themselves, but the disturbance is carried forward. This is what happens during propagation of sound in a medium, hence sound can be visualised as a wave. Sound waves are characterised by the motion of particles in the medium and are called mechanical waves. Air is the most common medium through which sound travels. When a vibrating object moves forward, it pushes and compresses the air in front of it creating a region of high pressure. This region is called a compression (C), as shown in Fig. 11.4. This compression starts to move away from the vibrating object. When the vibrating object moves backwards, it creates a region of low pressure called rarefaction (R), as shown in Fig. 11.4. As the object moves back and forth rapidly, a series of compressions and rarefactions is created in the air. These make the sound wave that Fig. 11.3: Both the prongs of the vibrating tuning fork dipped in water From the above activities what do you conclude? Can you produce sound without a vibrating object? In the above activities we have produced sound by striking the tuning fork. We can also produce sound by plucking, scratching, rubbing, blowing or shaking different objects. As per the above activities what do we do to the objects? We set the objects vibrating and produce sound. Vibration means a kind of rapid to and fro motion of an object. The sound of the human voice is produced due to vibrations in the vocal cords. When a bird flaps its wings, do you hear any sound? Think how the buzzing sound accompanying a bee is produced. A stretched rubber band when plucked vibrates and produces sound. If you have never done this, then do it and observe the vibration of the stretched rubber band. Activity _____________11.3 • Make a list of different types of musical instruments and discuss with your friends which part of the instrument vibrates to produce sound. 11.2 Propagation of Sound Sound is produced by vibrating objects. The matter or substance through which sound is transmitted is called a medium. It can be solid, liquid or gas. Sound moves through a medium from the point of generation to the listener. When an object vibrates, it sets the particles of the medium around it vibrating. The particles do not travel all the way from Fig. 11.4: A vibrating object creating a series of compressions (C) and rarefactions (R) in the medium. Reprint 2025-26"}

Pressure is related to the number of particles of a medium in a given volume. More density of the particles in the medium gives more pressure and vice versa. Thus, propagation of sound can be visualised as propagation of density variations or pressure variations in the medium. uestion 1.

Ask your friend to hold one end. You hold the other end. Now stretch the slinky as shown in Fig. 11.5(a). Then give it a sharp push towards your friend. • What do you notice? If you move your hand pushing and pulling the slinky alternatively, what will you observe? • If you mark a dot on the slinky, you will observe that the dot on the slinky will move back and forth parallel to the direction of the propagation of the disturbance. The regions where the coils become closer are called compressions (C) and the regions where the coils are further apart are called rarefactions (R). As we already know, sound propagates in the medium as a series of compressions and rarefactions. Now, we can compare the propagation of disturbance in a slinky with the sound propagation in the medium. These waves are called longitudinal waves. In these waves the individual particles of the medium move in a direction parallel to the direction of propagation of the disturbance. The particles do not move from one place to another but they simply oscillate back and forth about their position of rest. This is exactly how a sound wave propagates, hence sound waves are longitudinal waves. There is also another type of wave, called a transverse wave. In a transverse wave particles do not oscillate along the direction of wave propagation but oscillate up and down about their mean position as the wave travels. Thus, a transverse wave is the one in which the individual particles of the medium move about their mean positions in a direction perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. When we drop a pebble in a pond, the waves you see on the water surface is an example of transverse wave. Light is a transverse wave but for light, the oscillations are not of the medium particles or their pressure or density— it is not a mechanical wave. You will come to know more about transverse waves in higher classes. 11.2.2 CHARACTERISTICS OF A SOUND WAVE We can describe a sound wave by its • frequency • amplitude and • speed. Q A sound wave in graphic form is shown in Fig. 11.6(c), which represents how density and pressure change when the sound wave moves in the medium. The density as well as the pressure of the medium at a given time varies with distance, above and below the average value of density and pressure.

The faster the vibration of the source, the higher is the frequency and the higher is the pitch, as shown in Fig. 11.7. Thus, a high pitch sound corresponds to more number of compressions and rarefactions passing a fixed point per unit time. Objects of different sizes and conditions vibrate at different frequencies to produce sounds of different pitch. The magnitude of the maximum disturbance in the medium on either side of the mean value is called the amplitude of the wave. It is usually represented by the letter A, as shown in Fig. 11.6(c). For sound its unit will be that of density or pressure. The loudness or softness of a sound is determined basically by its amplitude. The amplitude of the sound wave depends upon the force with which an object is made to vibrate. If we strike a table lightly, we hear a soft sound because we produce a sound wave density of the medium oscillates between a maximum value and a minimum value. The change in density from the maximum value to the minimum value, then again to the maximum value, makes one complete oscillation. The number of such oscillations per unit time is the frequency of the sound wave. If we can count the number of the compressions or rarefactions that cross us per unit time, we will get the frequency of the sound wave. It is usually represented by n (Greek letter, nu). Its SI unit is hertz (symbol, Hz). The time taken by two consecutive compressions or rarefactions to cross a fixed point is called the time period of the wave. In other words, we can say that the time taken for one complete oscillation is called the time period of the sound wave. It is represented by the symbol T. Its SI unit is second (s). Frequency and time period are related as follows: A violin and a flute may both be played at the same time in an orchestra. Both sounds travel through the same medium, that is, air and arrive at our ear at the same time. Both sounds travel at the same speed irrespective of the source. But the sounds we receive are different. This is due to the different characteristics associated with the sound. Pitch is one of the characteristics. = 1 v T Fig. 11.7: Fig. 11.7: Fig. 11.7: Fig. 11.7: Fig. 11.7: Low pitch sound has low frequency and high pitch of sound has high frequency.

Solution: Given, Frequency, ν = 2 kHz = 2000 Hz Wavelength, λ = 35 cm = 0.35 m We know that speed, v of the wave = wavelength × frequency v = λ ν = 0.35 m 2000 Hz = 700 m/s The time taken by the wave to travel a distance, d of 1.5 km is Thus sound will take 2.1 s to travel a distance of 1.5 km. uestions 1.

A person is listening to a tone of 500 Hz sitting at a distance of 450 m from the source of the sound. What is the time interval between successive compressions from the source? The amount of sound energy passing each second through unit area is called the intensity of sound. We sometimes use the terms “loudness” and “intensity” interchangeably, but they are not the same. Loudness is a measure of the response of the ear to the sound. Even when two sounds are of equal intensity, we may hear one as louder than the other simply because our ear detects it better. of less energy (amplitude). If we hit the table hard we hear a louder sound. Can you tell why? A sound wave spreads out from its source. As it moves away from the source its amplitude as well as its loudness decreases. Louder sound can travel a larger distance as it is associated with higher energy. Fig. 11.8 shows the wave shapes of a loud and a soft sound of the same frequency. The quality or timber of sound is that characteristic which enables us to distinguish one sound from another having the same pitch and loudness. The sound which is more pleasant is said to be of a rich quality. A sound of single frequency is called a tone. The sound which is produced due to a mixture of several frequencies is called a note and is pleasant to listen to. Noise is unpleasant to the ear! Music is pleasant to hear and is of rich quality. Here λ is the wavelength of the sound wave. It is the distance travelled by the sound wave in one time period (T) of the wave. Thus, v = λ ν or v = λ ν That is, speed = wavelength × frequency. The speed of sound remains almost the same for all frequencies in a given medium under the same physical conditions. Reprint 2025-26"}

Like light, sound gets reflected at the surface of a solid or liquid and follows the same laws of reflection as you have studied in earlier classes. The directions in which the sound is incident and is reflected make equal angles with the normal to the reflecting surface at the point of incidence, and the three are in the same plane. An obstacle of large size which may be polished or rough is needed for the reflection of sound waves. Activity _____________11.5 • Take two identical pipes, as shown in Fig. 11.9. You can make the pipes using chart paper. The length of the pipes should be sufficiently long as shown. • Arrange them on a table near a wall. • Keep a clock near the open end of one of the pipes and try to hear the sound of the clock through the other pipe. • Adjust the position of the pipes so that you can best hear the sound of the clock. • Now, measure the angles of incidence and reflection and see the relationship between the angles. • Lift the pipe on the right vertically to a small height and observe what happens. (In place of a clock, a mobile phone on vibrating mode may also be used.) Q Q 11.2.3 SPEED OF SOUND IN DIFFERENT MEDIA Sound propagates through a medium at a finite speed. The sound of a thunder is heard a little later than the flash of light is seen. So, we can make out that sound travels with a speed which is much less than the speed of light. The speed of sound depends on the properties of the medium through which it travels. You will learn about this dependence in higher classes. The speed of sound in a medium depends on temperature of the medium. The speed of sound decreases when we go from solid to gaseous state. In any medium as we increase the temperature, the speed of sound increases. For example, the speed of sound in air is 331 m s–1 at 0 ºC and 344 m s–1 at 22 ºC. The speeds of sound at a particular temperature in various media are listed in Table 11.1. You need not memorise the values.

This sound which we hear is called an echo. The sensation of sound persists in our brain for about 0.1 s. To hear a distinct echo the time interval between the original sound and the reflected one must be at least 0.1s. If we take the speed of sound to be 344 m/s at a given temperature, say at 22 ºC in air, the sound must go to the obstacle and reach back the ear of the listener on reflection after 0.1s. Hence, the total distance covered by the sound from the point of generation to the reflecting surface and back should be at least (344 m/s) × 0.1 s = 34.4 m. Thus, for hearing distinct echoes, the minimum distance of the obstacle from the source of sound must be half of this distance, that is, 17.2 m. This distance will change with the temperature of air. Echoes may be heard more than once due to successive or multiple reflections. The rolling of thunder is due to the successive reflections of the sound from a number of reflecting surfaces, such as the clouds and the land. 11.3.2 REVERBERATION A sound created in a big hall will persist by repeated reflection from the walls until it is reduced to a value where it is no longer audible. The repeated reflection that results in this persistence of sound is called reverberation. In an auditorium or big hall excessive reverberation is highly undesirable. To reduce reverberation, the roof and walls of the auditorium are generally covered with sound-absorbent materials like compressed fibreboard, rough plaster or draperies. The seat materials are also selected on the basis of their sound absorbing properties. Example 11.2 A person clapped his hands near a cliff and heard the echo after 2 s. What is the distance of the cliff from the person if the speed of the sound, v is taken as 346 m s–1? Solution: Given, Speed of sound, v = 346 m s–1 Time taken for hearing the echo, t = 2 s Distance travelled by the sound = v × t = 346 m s–1 × 2 s = 692 m In 2 s sound has to travel twice the distance between the cliff and the person. Hence, the distance between the cliff and the person = 692 m/2 = 346 m. Q Horn Megaphone Fig 11.10: A megaphone and a horn. uestion 1. An echo is heard in 3 s.

Why are the ceilings of concert halls curved? 11.4 Range of Hearing The audible range of sound for human beings extends from about 20 Hz to 20000 Hz (one Hz = one cycle/s). Children under the age of five and some animals, such as dogs can hear up to 25 kHz (1 kHz = 1000 Hz). As people grow older their ears become less sensitive to higher frequencies. Sounds of frequencies below 20 Hz are called infrasonic sound or infrasound. If we could hear infrasound we would hear the vibrations of a pendulum just as we hear the vibrations of the wings of a bee. Rhinoceroses communicate using infrasound of frequency as low as 5 Hz. Whales and elephants produce sound in the infrasound range. It is observed that some animals get disturbed before earthquakes. Earthquakes produce low-frequency infrasound before the main shock waves begin which possibly alert the animals. Frequencies higher than 20 kHz are called ultrasonic sound or ultrasound. Ultrasound is produced by animals such as dolphins, bats and porpoises. Moths of certain families have very sensitive hearing equipment. These moths can hear the high frequency Q Fig.11.11: Stethoscope 3. Generally the ceilings of concert halls, conference halls and cinema halls are curved so that sound after reflection reaches all corners of the hall, as shown in Fig 11.12. Sometimes a curved soundboard may be placed behind the stage so that the sound, after reflecting from the sound board, spreads evenly across the width of the hall (Fig 11.13). In these instruments, a tube followed by a conical opening reflects sound successively to guide most of the sound waves from the source in the forward direction towards the audience.

Food supplies proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and minerals, all of which we require for body development, growth and health. Both plants and animals are major sources of food for us. We obtain most of this food from agriculture and animal husbandry. We read in newspapers that efforts are always being made to improve production from agriculture and animal husbandry. Why is this necessary? Why we cannot make do with the current levels of production? India is a very populous country. Our population is more than one billion people, and it is still growing. As food for this growing population, we will soon need more than a quarter of a billion tonnes of grain every year. This can be done by farming on more land. But India is already intensively cultivated. As a result, we do not have any major scope for increasing the area of land under cultivation. Therefore, it is necessary to increase our production efficiency for both crops and livestock. Efforts to meet the food demand by increasing food production have led to some successes so far. We have had the green revolution, which contributed to increased food-grain production. We have also had the white revolution, which has led to better and more efficient use as well as availability of milk. However, these revolutions mean that our natural resources are getting used more intensively. As a result, there are more chances of causing damage to our natural resources to the point of destroying their balance completely. Therefore, it is important that we should increase food production without degrading our environment and disturbing the balances maintaining it. Hence, there is a need for sustainable practices in agriculture and animal husbandry. Also, simply increasing grain production for storage in warehouses cannot solve the problem of malnutrition and hunger. People should have money to purchase food. Food security depends on both availability of food and access to it. The majority of our population depends on agriculture for their livelihood. Increasing the incomes of people working in agriculture is therefore necessary to combat the problem of hunger. Scientific management practices should be undertaken to obtain high yields from farms. For sustained livelihood, one should undertake mixed farming, intercropping, and integrated farming practices, for example, combine agriculture with livestock/poultry/fisheries/ bee-keeping. The question thus becomes – how do we increase the yields of crops and livestock? 12.1 Improvement in Crop Yields Cereals such as wheat, rice, maize, millets and sorghum provide us carbohydrate for energy requirement. Pulses like gram (chana), pea (matar), black gram (urad), green gram (moong), pigeon pea (arhar), lentil (masoor), provide us with protein. And oil seeds including soyabean, ground nut, sesame, castor, mustard, linseed and sunflower provide us with necessary fats (Fig. 12.1). Vegetables, spices and fruits provide a range of vitamins and minerals in addition to small amounts of proteins, carbohydrates and fats. In addition to these food crops, fodder crops like berseem, oats or sudan grass are raised as food for the livestock. 12 IMPROVEMENT MPROVEMENT MPROVEMENT MPROVEMENT MPROVEMENT IN IN IN IN IN F F F F FOOD OOD OOD OOD OOD R R R R RESOURCES ESOURCES ESOURCES ESOURCES ESOURCES C hapter Reprint 2025-26"}

Paddy, soyabean, pigeon pea, maize, cotton, green gram and black gram are kharif crops, whereas wheat, gram, peas, mustard, linseed are rabi crops. In India there has been a four times increase in the production of food grains from 1952 to 2010 with only 25% increase in the cultivable land area. How has this increase in production been achieved? If we think of the practices involved in farming, we can see that we can divide it into three stages. The first is the choice of seeds for planting. The second is the nurturing of the crop plants. The third is the protection of the growing and harvested crops from loss. Thus, the major groups of activities for improving crop yields can be classified as: • Crop variety improvement • Crop production improvement • Crop protection management. 12.1.1 CROP VARIETY IMPROVEMENT This approach depends on finding a crop variety that can give a good yield. Varieties or strains of crops can be selected by breeding for various useful characteristics such as disease resistance, response to fertilisers, product quality and high yields. One way of incorporating desirable characters into crop varieties is by hybridisation. Hybridisation refers to crossing between genetically dissimilar plants. This crossing may be intervarietal (between different varieties), interspecific (between two different species of the same genus) or intergeneric (between different genera). Another way of improving the crop is by introducing a gene that would provide the desired characteristic. This results in genetically modified crops. For new varieties of crops to be accepted, it is necessary that the variety produces high yields under different conditions that are found in different areas. Farmers would need to be provided with good quality seeds of a particular variety, that is, the seeds should all Fig. 12.1: Different types of crops uestion 1. What do we get from cereals, pulses, fruits and vegetables? Different crops require different climatic conditions, temperature and photoperiods for their growth and completion of their life cycle. Photoperiods are related to the duration of sunlight. Growth of plants and flowering are dependent on sunlight. As we all know, plants manufacture their food in sunlight by the process of photosynthesis. There are some crops, which are grown in rainy season, called Q Reprint 2025-26"}

Cultivation practices and crop yield are related to weather, soil quality and availability of water. Since weather conditions such as drought and flood situations are unpredictable, varieties that can be grown in diverse climatic conditions are useful. Similarly, varieties tolerant to high soil salinity have been developed. Some of the factors for which variety improvement is done are: • Higher yield: To increase the productivity of the crop per acre. • Improved quality: Quality considerations of crop products vary from crop to crop. Baking quality is important in wheat, protein quality in pulses, oil quality in oilseeds and preserving quality in fruits and vegetables. • Biotic and abiotic resistance: Crops production can go down due to biotic (diseases, insects and nematodes) and abiotic (drought, salinity, water logging, heat, cold and frost) stresses under different situations. Varieties resistant to these stresses can improve crop production. • Change in maturity duration: The shorter the duration of the crop from sowing to harvesting, the more economical is the variety. Such short durations allow farmers to grow multiple rounds of crops in a year. Short duration also reduces the cost of crop production. Uniform maturity makes the harvesting process easy and reduces losses during harvesting. • Wider adaptability: Developing varieties for wider adaptability will help in stabilising the crop production under different environmental conditions. One variety can then be grown under different climatic conditions in different areas. • Desirable agronomic characteristics: Tallness and profuse branching are desirable characters for fodder crops. Dwarfness is desired in cereals, so that less nutrients are consumed by these crops. Thus developing varieties of desired agronomic characters help give higher productivity. uestions 1. How do biotic and abiotic factors affect crop production? 2. What are the desirable agronomic characteristics for crop improvements? 12.1.2 CROP PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT In India, as in many other agriculture-based countries, farming ranges from small to very large farms. Different farmers thus have more or less land, money and access to information and technologies. In short, it is the money or financial conditions that allow farmers to take up different farming practices and agricultural technologies. There is a correlation between higher inputs and yields. Thus, the farmer’s purchasing capacity for inputs decides cropping system and production practices. Therefore, production practices can be at different levels. They include ‘no cost’ production, ‘low cost’ production and ‘high cost’ production practices. 12.1.2 (i) NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT Just as we need food for development, growth and well-being, plants also require nutrients for growth. Nutrients are supplied to plants by air, water and soil. There are several nutrients which are essential for plants. Air supplies carbon and oxygen, hydrogen comes from water, and soil supplies the other thirteen nutrients to plants. Amongst these, some are required in large quantities and are therefore called macro-nutrients. The other nutrients are used by plants in small quantities and are therefore called micro-nutrients (Table 12.1). Q Reprint 2025-26"}

Using biological waste material is also a way of recycling farm waste. Based on the kind of biological material used, manure can be classified as: (i) Compost and vermi-compost: The process in which farm waste material like livestock excreta (cow dung, etc.), vegetable waste, animal refuse, domestic waste, sewage waste, straw, eradicated weeds etc. is decomposed in pits is known as composting. The compost is rich in organic matter and nutrients. Compost is also prepared by using earthworms to hasten the process of decomposition of plant and animal refuse. This is called vermi-compost. (ii) Green manure: Prior to the sowing of the crop seeds, some plants like sun hemp or guar are grown and then mulched by ploughing them into the soil. These green plants thus turn into green manure which helps in enriching the soil in nitrogen and phosphorus. FERTILIZERS Fertilizers are commercially produced plant nutrients. Fertilizers supply nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. They are used to ensure good vegetative growth (leaves, branches and flowers), giving rise to healthy plants. Fertilizers are a factor in the higher yields of high-cost farming. Fertilizers should be applied carefully in terms of proper dose, time, and observing pre- and post-application precautions for their complete utilisation. For example, sometimes fertilizers get washed away due to excessive irrigation and are not fully absorbed by the plants. This excess fertilizer then leads to water pollution. Also, as we have seen in the previous class, continuous use of fertilizers in an area can destroy soil fertility because the organic matter in the soil is not replenished and micro-organisms in the soil are harmed by the fertilizers used. Short-term benefits of using fertilizers and long-term benefits of using Deficiency of these nutrients affects physiological processes in plants including reproduction, growth and susceptibility to diseases. To increase the yield, the soil can be enriched by supplying these nutrients in the form of manure and fertilizers. uestions 1. What are macro-nutrients and why are they called macro- nutrients? 2. How do plants get nutrients? MANURE Manure contains large quantities of organic matter and also supplies small quantities of nutrients to the soil. Manure is prepared by the decomposition of animal excreta and plant waste. Manure helps in enriching soil with nutrients and organic matter and increasing soil fertility. The bulk of organic matter in manure helps in improving the soil structure. This involves increasing the water holding capacity in sandy soils. In clayey soils, the large quantities of organic matter help in drainage and in avoiding water logging.

Under such conditions, several different kinds of irrigation systems are adopted to supply water to agricultural lands depending on the kinds of water resources available. These include wells, canals, rivers and tanks. • Wells: There are two types of wells, namely dug wells and tube wells. In a dug well, water is collected from water bearing strata. Tube wells can tap water from the deeper strata. From these wells, water is lifted by pumps for irrigation. • Canals: This is usually an elaborate and extensive irrigation system. In this system canals receive water from one or more reservoirs or from rivers. The main canal is divided into branch canals having further distributaries to irrigate fields. • River Lift Systems: In areas where canal flow is insufficient or irregular due to inadequate reservoir release, the lift system is more rational. Water is directly drawn from the rivers for supplementing irrigation in areas close to rivers. • Tanks: These are small storage reservoirs, which intercept and store the run-off of smaller catchment areas. Fresh initiatives for increasing the water available for agriculture include rainwater harvesting and watershed management. This involves building small check-dams which lead to an increase in ground water levels. The check-dams stop the rainwater from flowing away and also reduce soil erosion. 12.1.2 (iii) CROPPING PATTERNS Different ways of growing crops can be used to give maximum benefit. Mixed cropping is growing two or more crops simultaneously on the same piece of land, for example, wheat + gram, or wheat + mustard, or groundnut + sunflower. This reduces risk and gives some insurance against failure of one of the crops. manure for maintaining soil fertility have to be considered while aiming for optimum yields in crop production. uestion 1. Compare the use of manure and fertilizers in maintaining soil fertility. Organic farming is a farming system with minimal or no use of chemicals as fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, etc., and with a maximum input of organic manures, recycled farm-wastes (straw and livestock excreta), use of bio-agents such as culture of blue green algae in preparation of biofertilizers, neem leaves or turmeric specifically in grain storage as bio-pesticides, with healthy cropping systems [mixed cropping, inter-cropping and crop rotation as discussed below in 12.1.2.(iii)]. These cropping systems are beneficial in insect, pest and wheat control besides providing nutrients. 12.1.2 (ii) IRRIGATION Most agriculture in India is rain-fed, that is, the success of crops in most areas is dependent on timely monsoons and sufficient rainfall spread through most of the growing season. Hence, poor monsoons cause crop failure. Ensuring that the crops get water at the right stages during their growing season can increase the expected yields of any crop. Therefore, many measures are used to bring more and more agricultural land under irrigation. Q More to know Droughts occur because of scarcity or irregular distribution of rains. Drought poses a threat to rain-fed farming areas, where farmers do not use irrigation for crop production and depend only on rain. Light soils have less water retention capacity. In areas with light soils, crops get adversely affected by drought conditions. Scientists have developed some crop varieties which can tolerate drought conditions. Reprint 2025-26"}

A few rows of one crop alternate with a few rows of a second crop, for example, soyabean + maize, or finger millet (bajra) + cowpea (lobia). The crops are selected such that their nutrient requirements are different. This ensures maximum utilisation of the nutrients supplied, and also prevents pests and diseases from spreading to all the plants belonging to one crop in a field. This way, both crops can give better returns. (gokhroo), Parthenium (gajar ghas), Cyperus rotundus (motha). They compete for food, space and light. Weeds take up nutrients and reduce the growth of the crop. Therefore, removal of weeds from cultivated fields during the early stages of crop growth is essential for a good harvest. Generally insect pests attack the plants in three ways: (i) they cut the root, stem and leaf, (ii) they suck the cell sap from various parts of the plant, and (iii) they bore into stem and fruits. They thus affect the health of the crop and reduce yields. Diseases in plants are caused by pathogens such as bacteria, fungi and viruses. These pathogens can be present in and transmitted through the soil, water and air. Weeds, insects and diseases can be controlled by various methods. One of the most commonly used methods is the use of pesticides, which include herbicides, insecticides and fungicides. These chemicals are sprayed on crop plants or used for treating seeds and soil. However, excessive use of these chemicals creates problems, since they can be poisonous to many plant and animal species and cause environmental pollution. Weed control methods also include mechanical removal. Preventive methods such as proper seed bed preparation, timely sowing of crops, intercropping and crop rotation also help in weed control. Some other preventive measures against pests are the use of resistant varieties, and summer ploughing, in which fields are ploughed deep in summers to destroy weeds and pests. uestion 1. Which of the following conditions will give the most benefits? Why? (a) Farmers use high-quality seeds, do not adopt irrigation or use fertilizers. (b) Farmers use ordinary seeds, adopt irrigation and use fertilizer. (c) Farmers use quality seeds, adopt irrigation, use fertilizer and use crop protection measures. Q Fig. 12.2 : Fig. 12.2 : Fig. 12.2 : Fig. 12.2 : Fig. 12.2 : Intercropping The growing of different crops on a piece of land in a pre-planned succession is known as crop rotation. Depending upon the duration, crop rotation is done for different crop combinations. The availability of moisture and irrigation facilities decide the choice of the crop to be cultivated after one harvest. If crop rotation is done properly then two or three crops can be grown in a year with good harvests. 12.1.3 CROP PROTECTION MANAGEMENT Field crops are infested by a large number of weeds, insect pests and diseases.

Factors responsible for such losses are biotic— insects, rodents, fungi, mites and bacteria, and abiotic— inappropriate moisture and temperatures in the place of storage. These factors cause degradation in quality, loss in weight, poor germinability, discolouration of produce, all leading to poor marketability. These factors can be controlled by proper treatment and by systematic management of warehouses. Preventive and control measures are used before grains are stored for future use. They include strict cleaning of the produce before storage, proper drying of the produce first in sunlight and then in shade, and fumigation using chemicals that can kill pests. uestions 1.

It includes various aspects such as feeding, breeding and disease control. Animal-based farming includes cattle, goat, sheep, poultry and fish farming. As the population increases and as living standards increase, the demand for milk, eggs and meat is also going up. Also, the growing awareness of the need for humane treatment of livestock has brought in new limitations in livestock farming. Thus, livestock production also needs to be improved. 12.2.1 CATTLE FARMING Cattle husbandry is done for two purposes— milk and draught labour for agricultural work such as tilling, irrigation and carting. Indian cattle belong to two different species, Bos indicus, cows, and Bos bubalis, buffaloes. Milk-producing females are called milch animals (dairy animals), while the ones used for farm labour are called draught animals.

Exotic or foreign breeds (for example, Jersey, Brown Swiss) are selected for long lactation periods, while local breeds (for example, Red Sindhi, Sahiwal) show excellent resistance to diseases. The two can be cross-bred to get animals with both the desired qualities. uestion 1. Which method is commonly used for improving cattle breeds and why? Activity _____________12.3 • Visit a livestock farm. Note the following: (1) Number of cattle and number of different breeds. (2) The amount of daily milk production from the different breeds. Proper cleaning and shelter facilities for cows and buffaloes are required for humane farming, for the health of the animals and for production of clean milk as well. Animals require regular brushing to remove dirt and loose hair. They should be sheltered under well-ventilated roofed sheds that protect them from rain, heat and cold. The floor of the cattle shed needs to be sloping so as to stay dry and to facilitate cleaning. The food requirements of dairy animals are of two types: (a) maintenance requirement, which is the food required to support the animal to live a healthy life, and (b) milk producing requirement, which is the type of food required during the lactation period. Animal feed includes: (a) roughage, which is largely fibre, and (b) concentrates, which are low in fibre and contain relatively high levels of proteins and other nutrients. Cattle need balanced rations containing all nutrients in proportionate amounts. Besides such nutritious food material, certain feed additives containing micronutrients promote the health and milk output of dairy animals. Cattle suffer from a number of diseases. The diseases, besides causing death, reduce milk production. A healthy animal feeds regularly and has a normal posture. The parasites of cattle may be both external parasites and internal parasites. The external parasites live on the skin and mainly cause skin diseases. The internal parasites like worms, affect stomach and intestine while flukes damage the liver. Infectious diseases are also caused by bacteria and viruses. Vaccinations are given to farm animals against many major viral and bacterial diseases. 12.2.2 POULTRY FARMING Poultry farming is undertaken to raise domestic fowl for egg production and chicken meat. Therefore, improved poultry breeds are developed and farmed to produce layers for eggs and broilers for meat. The cross-breeding programmes between Indian (indigenous, for example, Aseel) and foreign (exotic, for example, Leghorn) breeds for variety improvement are focused on to develop new varieties for the following desirable traits— (i) number and quality of chicks; Q Fig. 12.3: Indigenous milch breed of cattle Reprint 2025-26"}

The ration (daily food requirement) for broilers is protein rich with adequate fat. The level of vitamins A and K is kept high in the poultry feeds. Poultry fowl suffer from a number of diseases caused by virus, bacteria, fungi, parasites, as well as from nutritional deficiencies. These necessitate proper cleaning, sanitation, and spraying of disinfectants at regular intervals. Appropriate vaccination can prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases and reduce loss of poultry during an outbreak of disease. uestions 1.

Identify the growers, layers and broilers. 12.2.3 FISH PRODUCTION Fish is a cheap source of animal protein for our food. Fish production includes the finned true fish as well as shellfish such as prawns and molluscs. There are two ways of obtaining fish. One is from natural resources, which is called capture fishing. The other way is by fish farming, which is called culture fishery. The water source of the fish can be either seawater or fresh water, such as in rivers and ponds. Fishing can thus be done both by capture and culture of fish in marine and freshwater ecosystems. 12.2.3 (i) MARINE FISHERIES India’s marine fishery resources include 7500 km of coastline and the deep seas Fig. 12.4 Aseel Leghorn uestion 1. Discuss the implications of the following statement: “It is interesting to note that poultry is India’s most efficient converter of low fibre food stuff (which is unfit for human consumption) into highly nutritious animal protein food.” EGG AND BROILER PRODUCTION Broiler chickens are fed with vitamin-rich supplementary feed for good growth rate and better feed efficiency. Care is taken to avoid mortality and to maintain feathering and carcass quality. They are produced as broilers and sent to market for meat purposes. For good production of poultry birds, good management practices are important. These include maintenance of temperature and hygienic conditions in housing and poultry feed, as well as prevention and control of diseases and pests. The housing, nutritional and environmental requirements of broilers are somewhat different from those of egg layers. Q Q Reprint 2025-26"}

Marine fish are caught using many kinds of fishing nets from fishing boats. Yields are increased by locating large schools of fish in the open sea using satellites and echo-sounders. Some marine fish of high economic value are also farmed in seawater. This includes finned fishes like mullets, bhetki, and pearl spots, shellfish such as prawns (Fig. 12.5), mussels and oysters as well as seaweed. Oysters are also cultivated for the pearls they make. Macrobrachium rosenbergii (fresh water) Peneaus monodon (marine) Fig. 12.5 : Fresh water and marine prawns As marine fish stocks get further depleted, the demand for more fish can only be met by such culture fisheries, a practice called mariculture. 12.2.3 (ii) INLAND FISHERIES Fresh water resources include canals, ponds, reservoirs and rivers. Brackish water resources, where seawater and fresh water mix together, such as estuaries and lagoons are also important fish reservoirs. While capture fishing is also done in such inland water bodies, the yield is not high. Most fish production from these resources is through aquaculture. Fish culture is sometimes done in combination with a rice crop, so that fish are grown in the water in the paddy field. More intensive fish farming can be done in composite fish culture systems. Both local and imported fish species are used in such systems. In such a system, a combination of five or six fish species is used in a single fishpond. These species are selected so that they do not compete for food among them having different types of food habits. As a result, the food available in all the parts of the pond is used. As Catlas are surface feeders, Rohus feed in the middle-zone of the pond, Mrigals and Common Carps are bottom feeders, and Grass Carps feed on the weeds, together these species (Fig. 12.6) can use all the food in the pond without competing with each other. This increases the fish yield from the pond. (a) (b) (c) (d) Fig. 12.6: (a) Catla (b) Silver carp (c) Rohu (d) Grass Carp (e) Mrigal (f) Common Carp (e) (f) One problem with such composite fish culture is that many of these fish breed only during monsoon. Even if fish seed is collected from the wild, it can be mixed with that of other species as well. So, a major problem in fish farming is the lack of availability of good- quality seed. To overcome this problem, ways have now been worked out to breed these fish in ponds using hormonal stimulation. This has ensured the supply of pure fish seed in desired quantities.

Since bee-keeping needs low investments, farmers use it as an additional income generating activity. In addition to honey, the beehives are a source of wax which is used in various medicinal preparations. The local varieties of bees used for commercial honey production are Apis cerana indica, commonly known as the Indian bee, A. dorsata, the rock bee and A. florae, the little bee. An Italian bee variety, A. mellifera, has also been brought in to increase yield of honey. This is the variety commonly used for commercial honey production. The Italian bees have high honey collection capacity. They sting somewhat less. They stay in a given beehive for long periods, and breed very well. For commercial honey production, bee farms or apiaries are established. The value or quality of honey depends upon the pasturage, or the flowers available to the bees for nectar and pollen collection. In addition to adequate quantity of pasturage, the kind of flowers available will determine the taste of the honey. uestions 1.

Poultry production includes egg production and broiler production for poultry meat. • To enhance poultry production, cross breeding is done between Indian and exotic breeds for variety improvement. • Fish may be obtained from marine resources as well as inland resources. • To increase production of fish, they can be cultured in marine and inland ecosystems. • Marine fish capture is done by fishing nets guided by echo-sounders and satellites. • Composite fish culture system is commonly used for fish farming. • Bee-keeping is done to get honey and wax. Exercises 1. Explain any one method of crop production which ensures high yield. 2. Why are manure and fertilizers used in fields? 3. What are the advantages of inter-cropping and crop rotation? 4. What is genetic manipulation? How is it useful in agricultural practices? 5. How do storage grain losses occur? 6. How do good animal husbandry practices benefit farmers? 7.

{"id": "class 9__sst__p3__c1", "text": "FOREWORD The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that children’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986). The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge. These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching days is actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience. The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in Social Sciences, Professor Hari Vasudevan and the Chief Advisors Reprint 2025-26"}

{"id": "class 9__sst__p5__c1", "text": "A LETTER FOR YOU Dear teachers and parents, ‘Civics is boring’. You may have heard this from your students or your child. You may have felt that they had a point. Syllabi of Civics in our country tend to focus on formal institutions of government. The textbooks are full of constitutional, legal and procedural details, presented in a dry and abstract manner. No wonder children experience disconnect between the theory they read in the textbook and what they see in real life around them. This is perhaps what makes Civics ‘boring’ for young adults in a country otherwise full of passion for politics. The present textbook is a small step towards changing this. The impetus came from the National Curriculum Framework 2005 that provided the space and opportunity to bring about this basic change. The foreword to this book by the Director of the NCERT explains the philosophy of the new curriculum. It meant a complete overhaul of the traditional Civics syllabi. The change in the name – from Civics to Political Science – reflects the shift in the focus. The new syllabi recognise that the student at this stage is aware of and needs to know more about politics. Accordingly, the students in classes IX and X will be offered an introduction to various facets of politics. Democracy is the window through which they get to look at the theory and the practice of politics. With this textbook you are going to take the students on a tour of a museum of contemporary democracy. You will first take them quickly through a series of stories from different parts of the world. Once they develop a sense and feel of democracy, you can ask some reflective questions: what is democracy? Why democracy? With this clarity you can take them to a gallery on constitutions. An understanding of what and how of the constitutions would prepare them for an exhibition on three aspects of democratic politics: elections, institutions and rights. You may encounter many contentious themes during this tour. Our attempt here is not to hand over a definite opinion to the students but to enable them to think on their own. This textbook is meant to help the students enjoy this tour and to assist you in guiding them. It does not merely inform the students. It encourages them to think on their own. It interacts with them through questions, moves Reprint 2025-26"}

All these features have meant taking more space than used to be the case earlier. It is precisely to reduce the information load that the book takes more pages. Please do read ‘How to use this book’ on the following pages to be able to use these features of the book. The tour will continue in the textbook for class X and will focus more on the working of democracy. We hope this tour will create interest in them to understand politics more carefully and to help them become active and participant citizens. This hope of ours rests on you. That is why this book makes more demands on you. You may have to learn more about new names, events and places. You may face questions that the textbook does not answer. You may have to guide the students through sensitive and passionate debates that naturally arise when we discuss politics. Just when you begin to feel tired or irritated, do entertain a thought. When your student asks a question that you find difficult to answer, when she seeks information that is not easy to find or expresses an opinion that you don’t approve of, this may actually be a sign of your success as a teacher or a parent. As we all know, getting students to question is critical to their learning process both as a student and as citizens of a democracy. This is what the present book tries to cultivate. The desire to get rid of the ‘boring Civics’ tag brought together, perhaps for the first time in our country, a group of political scientists, school teachers and educationists to think about how to teach politics to our next generation. You can read about this group, the Textbook Development Committee, on page xii. All these colleagues spared their valuable time and mental space for this unscheduled event in their academic calendar. Professor Krishna Kumar, Director NCERT, not only dragged some of us into this pleasant duty but also supported us at every stage. Professor Hari Vasudevan and Professor Gopal Guru provided this experiment the protection it needed. Professor Mrinal Miri, Professor G. P. Deshpande and other members of the National Monitoring Committee offered valuable inputs and criticisms. The experiment gained many friends on the way: Ambassador Jorge Heine, Arvind Sardana, Aditya Nigam, Suman Lata and Chandni Khanduja read different parts of the draft and provided valuable inputs. At many points it drew upon Lokniti research programme and Lokniti network of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies for intellectual and logistic resources. Above all, this experiment drew upon the insights and energy of Alex M. George, Pankaj Pushkar and Manish Jain – three young educationists committed to a radical pedagogy — who taught us how to think about the challenge of school education. Designer Oroon Das and cartoonist Irfan Khan and copy editor Devyani Onial helped us turn the idea of this book into a reality. We sincerely hope that you and the students would enjoy this book and perhaps look at politics as something valuable, something worth taking seriously, something worth studying. We look forward to your feedback. K. C. Suri Yogendra Yadav ADVISOR Suhas Palshikar CHIEF ADVISORS vi Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 9__sst__p7__c1", "text": "How to use this book? OVERVIEW comes at the beginning of each chapter. You can use it to understand the purpose of the chapter and how it links with the rest of the book. It also helps you explain the rationale behind the different sections of the chapter. If you are in doubt about what to teach, what to emphasise and what kind of questions to ask, please do refer back to the overview. Sections and Sub-sections help you break the chapter into small bits that you can take up one by one. Each chapter is usually divided into four sections, each of which you can complete within about three periods. Section Heading(s) are numbered and announce the beginning of a fresh theme within the chapter. Sub-section heading(s) provide convenient breaks for you to sum up one point and move to the next. Boxes are very much part of the main text and are meant to be taught. They provide additional information or analysis that requires a little detour. Each chapter begins with one or more real life stories or imagined dialogues. This is to create an interest and understanding of some central issues discussed in the chapter. Sometimes smaller stories or examples are used to lead the student into a section or sub-section. Please do tell this story in all its details. If you can, please add more details to those given here. You don’t need to bother very much if the student does not grasp the full significance of the story at this stage. As the chapter develops, it draws upon from the initial story and moves from the concrete to the abstract. But please do not ask the students to memorise the facts and details of the story like the year, names of personalities or places, etc. The same applies to any other example used in this book. This would kill their interest and defeat the very purpose of using stories. If the story is good, some details will stay in their memory. Even if no details stay with them but they can draw the general point from any such instance, we have succeeded in our task. Munni and Unni are two characters specially designed for this book by cartoonist Irfan Khan. The two of them keep appearing every now and then to ask all kinds of questions: impish, irrelevant, irreverent or even impossible. The questions are sparked off by the points made in the text. But in most cases you will not find the answer in the textbook itself. Munni and Unni are Reprint 2025-26"}

They give you the space to take a detour and get into a side discussion that is often richer than the main one. Please do not use these questions for evaluation. You would notice lots of cartoons and pictures in this book. This brings visual relief and some fun. But these images are meant to do more. These are parts of the teaching and learning process. The caption to each visual provides background information to help the student appreciate the message. It also asks them questions. Please do stop at each cartoon or visual and get the students involved in reading the message. If you can, please select some more cartoons from your regional languages and use them. Similarly there are several maps and many more references to countries unknown to the students. One of the aims of this book is to expand the student’s imagination beyond our own country. Please keep and refer to a recent political map of the world while teaching this book. Check your progress questions come usually at the end of every section. These questions give you an opportunity to ensure that the students comprehend the things discussed in that section. These questions also indicate to you the kind of learning you might wish to emphasise. May we urge you to please make more questions of this kind so that the student can move away from learning by rote. Activity may involve getting the students together within the classroom or doing things outside the classroom. You would need to guide them by assigning tasks to individuals or to groups. The activity and its location in the chapter is only suggestive. If you can think of an activity that relates better to students’ own life, please feel free to replace our suggestion with yours. Glossary of unfamiliar words or concepts comes at the end of a chapter. Such a word appears in pink when it is used for the first time. Please encourage the students to refer to the glossary and learn to use the word in a different context. But there is no need for them to memorise the definition given in the glossary. Exercises come at the end of each chapter. You would notice that there are many more questions here than used to be the case. You would also notice that the questions are of a different kind. These questions do not test the student’s ability to recall and reproduce what they have read in the Chapter. Keeping in with the approach of the new NCF, we have asked questions that require interpretation, application, analysis, and reasoning based on what they have learnt in the Chapter. You would need to spend some time with the students going over these exercises. Please feel free to come up with new and better questions than suggested here and use those for student evaluation.

Printed books, textbooks and the mass media such as newspapers and periodicals have ceased to be the only sources of information. Now millions of websites (World Wide Web) provide easy and instant access to a vast and diverse amount of online information. The World Wide Web has enabled a sudden and extreme decentralisation of information. Since many schools do not possess the latest encyclopaedias and traditional libraries, students and teachers may rely on the Internet to access the needed information. While using this textbook, the teachers and students may sometimes feel that information provided in the book is, ‘insufficient’ for learning or classroom teaching. You may want to know more about certain ideas, concepts and events in different countries. We would suggest some of the ways you can use the Internet for this purpose. You may find some information in free encyclopaedias like www.en.wikipedia.org or www.britannica.com Search engines like Google and Yahoo can provide links to websites that are specifically dedicated to different topics that you may be interested in. Similarly, several important newspapers and magazines are available online. Some of them allow you to access their archives without payments and registrations. Similarly a few TV channels also allow you to access information without registrations and payments. Some other websites would be useful to know more about the various institutions discussed in the text. You could find the links to all the Indian government institutional websites from www.india.gov.in. Specifically http://india.gov.in/directories_gov.php will provide you the direct link to various institutions. Similarly various international organisations such as United Nations, International Monetary Fund (IMF),World Bank, human rights organisations such as National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) too have their own websites. Apart from Indian constitution you will also find constitutions of many countries also being available online. You can also look at parliaments around the world by following the link from Inter Parliamentary Union www.ipu.org/english/home.htm Further you may want to use more images, pictures, or cartoons for discussions. You will find them in newspapers that are available online. Apart from it, you could also look at www.politicalcartoons.com for this purpose. Similarly, through searching “images” category of Google you could locate them. You may find it useful to visit the websites like www.plato.standford.edu, www.opendemocracy.net, www.brainyencyclopeid.com especially when you wish to get more clarity on certain theoretical aspects or to learn more about politics.

Step by step, we work out the meaning of the terms involved in this definition. The aim here is to understand clearly the bare minimum features of a democratic form of government. After going through this chapter we should be able to distinguish a democratic form of government from a non-democratic government. Towards the end of this chapter, we step beyond this minimal objective and introduce a broader idea of democracy. Democracy is the most prevalent form of government in the world today and it is expanding to more countries. But why is it so? What makes it better than other forms of government? That is the second big question that we take up in this chapter. CHAPTER 1 What is Democracy? Why Democracy? Reprint 2025-26"}
{"id": "class 9__sst__p16__c1", "text": "2 DEMOCRATIC POLITICS I have heard a different version. Democracy is off the people, far (from) the people and (where they) buy the people. Why don’t we accept that? 1.1 WHAT IS DEMOCRACY? But we don’t know if this is the best way of defining unless we think about it ourselves. We must not accept something just because it is famous, just because everyone accepts it. Yolanda: Ma’am, can I suggest something? We don’t need to look for any definition. I read somewhere that the word democracy comes from a Greek word ‘Demokratia’. In Greek ‘demos’ means people and ‘kratia’ means rule. So democracy is rule by the people. This is the correct meaning. Where is the need to debate? Lyngdoh Madam: That is also a very helpful way of thinking about this matter. I would just say that this does not always work. A word does not remain tied to its origin. Just think of computers. Originally they were used for computing, that is to say calculating, very difficult mathematical sums. These were very powerful calculators. But nowa- days very few people use computers for comput- ing sums. They use it for writing, for designing, for listening to music and for watching films. Words remain the same but their meaning can change with time. In that case it is not very useful to look at the origins of a word. Merry: Ma’am, so basically what you are saying is that there is no shortcut to our thinking about the matter ourselves. We have to think about its meaning and evolve a definition. Lyngdoh Madam: You got me right. Let us get on with it now. A C T I V I T Y Let us take Lyngdoh Madam seriously and try to write down the exact definition of some of the simple words that we use all the time: pen, rain and love. For example, is there a way of defining a pen that distinguishes it clearly from a pencil, a brush, a chalk or crayon. < What have you learnt from this attempt? < What does it teach us about understanding the meaning of democracy? A simple definition A simple definition A simple definition A simple definition A simple definition Let us get back to our discussion on similarities and differences among governments that are called You have already read about different forms of government. On the basis of your understanding of democracy so far, mentioning a few examples write down some common features of: < Democratic governments < Non-democratic governments Why define democracy? Why define democracy? Why define democracy? Why define democracy? Why define democracy? Before we proceed further, let us first take note of an objection by Merry. She does not like this way of defining democracy and wants to ask some basic questions. Her teacher Matilda Lyngdoh responds to her questions, as other classmates join the discussion: Merry: Ma’am, I don’t like this idea. First we spend time discussing democracy and then we want to find out the meaning of democracy. I mean logically shouldn’t we have approached it the other way round? Shouldn’t the meaning have come first and then the example? Lyngdoh Madam: I can see your point. But that is not how we reason in everyday life. We use words like pen, rain or love. Do we wait to have a definition of these words before we use them? Come to think of it, do we have clear definition of these words? It is only by using a word that we understand its meaning. Merry: But then why do we need definitions at all? Lyngdoh Madam: We need a definition only when we come across a difficulty in the use of a word. We need a definition of rain only when we wish to distinguish it from, say, drizzle or cloudburst. The same is true for democracy. We need a clear definition only because people use it for different purposes, because very different kinds of gov- ernments call themselves democracy. Ribiang: But why do we need to work on a defini- tion? The other day you quoted Abraham Lincoln to us: “Democracy is government of the people, by the people and for the people”. We in Meghalaya always ruled ourselves. That is accepted by everyone. Why do we need to change that? Lyngdoh Madam: I am not saying we need to change it. I too find this definition very beautiful.

{"id": "class 9__sst__p17__c1", "text": "3 WHAT IS DEMOCRACY? WHY DEMOCRACY? Ribiang went back home and collected some more famous quotations on democracy. This time she did not mention the names of the people who said or wrote these. She wants you to read these and comment on how good or useful these thoughts are: < Democracy gives every man the right to be his own oppressor. < Democracy consists of choosing your dictators after they’ve told you what you think it is you want to hear. < Man’s capacity for justice makes democracy possible, but man’s inclination to injustice makes democracy necessary < Democracy is a device that insures we shall be governed no better than we deserve. < All the ills of democracy can be cured by more democracy. democracies. One simple factor common to all democracies is: the government is chosen by the people. We could thus start with a simple definition: democracy is a form of government in which the rulers are elected by the people. This is a useful starting point. This definition allows us to separate democracy from forms of government that are clearly not democratic. The army rulers of Myanmar were not elected by the people. Those who happened to be in control of the army became the rulers of the country. People had no say in this decision. Dictators like Pinochet (Chile) are not elected by the people. This also applies to monarchies. The kings of Saudi Arabia rule not because the people have chosen them to do so but because they happen to be born into the royal family. This simple definition is not adequate. It reminds us that democracy is people’s rule. But if we use this definition in an unthinking manner, we would end up calling almost every government that holds an election a democracy. That would be very misleading. As we shall find out in Chapter 3, every government in contemporary world wants to be called a democracy, even if it is not so. That is why we need to carefully distinguish between a government that is a democracy and one that pretends to be one. We can do so by understanding each word in this definition carefully and spelling out the features of a democratic government.

In August 2002 he issued a ‘Legal Framework Order’ that amended the Constitution of Pakistan. According to this Order, the President can dismiss the national and provincial assemblies. The work of the civilian cabinet is supervised by a National Security Council which is dominated by military officers. After passing this law, elections were held to the national and provincial assemblies. So Pakistan has had elections, elected representatives have some powers. But the final power rested with military officers and General Musharraf himself. Clearly, there are many reasons why Pakistan under General Musharraf should not be called a democracy. But let us focus on one of these. Can we say that the rulers are elected by the people in Pakistan? Not quite. People may have elected their representatives to the national and provincial assemblies but those elected representatives were not really the rulers. They cannot take the final decisions. The power to take final decision rested with army officials and with General Musharraf, and none of them were elected by the people. This happens in many dictatorships and monarchies. They formally have an elected parliament and government but the real power is with those who are not elected. In a few countries, the real power was with some external powers and not with locally elected representatives. This cannot be called people’s rule. This gives us the first feature.

The PRI was known to use many dirty tricks to win elections. All those who were employed in government offices had to attend its party meetings. Teachers of government schools used to force parents to vote for the PRI. Media largely ignored the activities of opposition political parties except to criticise them. Sometimes the polling booths were shifted from one place to another in the last minute, which made it difficult for people to cast their votes. The PRI spent a large sum of money in the campaign for its candidates. Should we consider the elections described above as examples of people electing their rulers? Reading these examples we get a sense that we cannot. There are many problems here. In China the elections do not offer the people any serious choice. They have to choose the ruling party and the candidates approved by it. Can we call this a choice? In the Mexican example, people seemed to really have a choice but in practice they had no choice. There was no way the ruling party could be defeated, even if people were against it. These are not fair elections. We can thus add a second feature to our understanding of democracy. Holding elections of any kind is not sufficient. The elections must offer a real choice between political alternatives. And it should be possible for people to use this choice to remove the existing rulers, if they wish so. So, a democracy must be based on a free and fair election where those currently in power have a fair chance of losing. We shall find out more about a democratic election in Chapter 3.

This principle has now come to be accepted almost all over the world. Yet there are many instances of denial of equal right to vote. < Until 2015, in Saudi Arabia women did not have the right to vote. < Estonia has made its citizenship rules in such a way that people belonging to Russian minority find it difficult to get the right to vote. < In Fiji, the electoral system is such that the vote of an indigenous Fiji has more value than that of an Indian-Fijian. Democracy is based on a fundamental principle of political equality. That gives us the third feature of democracy: in a democracy, each adult citizen must have one vote and each vote must have one value. We shall read more about it in Chapter 3.

Since then the country has been ruled by ZANU-PF, the party that led the freedom struggle. Its leader, Robert Mugabe, ruled the country since independence. Elections were held regularly and always won by ZANU-PF. President Mugabe was popular but also used unfair practices in elections. Over the years his government changed the constitution several times to increase the powers of the President and make him less accountable. Opposition party workers were harassed and their meeting disrupted. Public protests and demonstrations against the government were declared illegal. There was a law that limited the right to criticise the President. Television and radio were controlled by the government and gave only the ruling party’s version. There were independent newspapers but the government harassed those journalists who went against it. The government ignored some court judgments that went against it and pressurised judges. He was forced out of office in 2017. The example of Zimbabwe shows that popular approval of the rulers is necessary in a democracy, but it is not sufficient. Popular governments can be undemocratic. Popular leaders can be autocratic. If we wish to assess a democracy, it is important to look at the elections. But it is equally important to look before and after the elections. There should be sufficient room for normal political activity, including political opposition, in the period before elections. This requires that the state should respect some basic rights of the citizen. They should be free to think, to have opinions, to express these in public, to form associations, to protest and take other political actions. Everyone should be equal in the eyes of law.

Similarly, there are some conditions that apply to the way a government is run after the elections. A democratic government cannot do whatever it likes, simply because it has won an election. It has to respect some basic rules. In particular it has to respect some guarantees to the minorities. Every major decision has to go through a series of consultations. Every office bearer has certain rights and responsibilities assigned by the constitution and the law. Each of these is accountable not only to the people but also to other independent officials.

Poimon: So, what should we have instead? Go back to the British rule? Invite some kings to rule this country? Rose: I don’t know. I think what this country needs is a strong leader, someone who does not have to bother about elections and parliament. One leader should have all the powers. He should be able to do whatever is needed in country’s interest. That alone can remove corruption and poverty from this country. Someone shouted: That is called dictatorship!

Now she stepped in: “I was delighted to see you all arguing so passionately. I don’t know who is right and who is wrong. That is for you to settle. But I did feel that you all wanted to speak your mind. You may have felt very bad if someone tried to stop you or if someone punished you for saying what you felt. Would you be able to do that in a country that is not democratic? Is that a good argument for democracy?” Arguments against democracy Arguments against democracy Arguments against democracy Arguments against democracy Arguments against democracy This conversation has most of the arguments that we routinely hear against democracy. Let us go over some of these arguments: < Leaders keep changing in a democracy. This leads to instability. < Democracy is all about political competition and power play. There is no scope for morality. < So many people have to be consulted in a democracy that it leads to delays. < Elected leaders do not know the best interest of the people. It leads to bad decisions. < Democracy leads to corruption for it is based on electoral competition. < Ordinary people don’t know what is good for them; they should not decide anything. Are there some other arguments against democracy that you can think of? Which of these arguments applies mainly to democracy? Which of these can apply to misuse of any form of government? Which of these do you agree with? Clearly, democracy is not a magical solution for all the problems. It has not ended poverty in our country and in other parts of the world. Democracy as a form of government only ensures that people take their own decisions. This does not guarantee that their decisions will be good. People can make mistakes. Involving the people in these decisions does lead to delays in decision making. It is also true that democracy leads to frequent changes in leadership. Sometimes this can set back big decisions and affect the government’s efficiency. These arguments show that democracy of the kind we see may not be the ideal form of government. But that is not a question we face in real life. The real question we face is different: is democracy better than other forms of government that are there for us to choose from?

The existence of democracy in India made the Indian government respond to food scarcity in a way that the Chinese government did not. They point out that no large-scale famine has ever taken place in an independent and democratic country. If China too had multiparty elections, an opposition party and a press free to criticise the government, then so many people may not have died in the famine. This example brings out one of the reasons why democracy is considered the best form of government. Democracy is better than any other form of government in responding to the needs of the people. A non- democratic government may and can respond to the people’s needs, but it all depends on the wishes of the people who rule. If the rulers don’t want to, they don’t have to act according to the wishes of the people. A democracy requires that the rulers have to attend to the needs of the people. A democratic government is a better government because it is a more accountable form of government. There is another reason why democracy should lead to better decisions than any non-democratic government. Democracy is based on consultation and discussion. A democratic decision always involves many persons, discussions and meetings. When a number of people put their heads together, they are able to point out possible mistakes in any decision. This takes time. But there is a big advantage in taking time over important decisions. This reduces the chances of rash or irresponsible decisions. Thus democracy improves the quality of decision-making. This is related to the third argument. Democracy provides a method to deal with differences and conflicts. In any society people are bound to have differences of opinions and interests. These differences are particularly sharp in a country like ours which has an amazing social diversity. People belong to different regions, speak different languages, practise different religions and have different castes. They look at the world very differently and have different preferences. The preferences of one group can clash with those of other groups. How do we resolve such a conflict? The conflict can be solved by brutal power. Whichever group is more powerful will dictate its terms and others will have to accept that. But that would lead to resentment and unhappiness. Different groups may not be able to live together for long in such a way. Democracy provides the only peaceful solution to this problem. In democracy, no one is a permanent winner. No one is a permanent loser. Different groups can live with one another peacefully. In a diverse country like India, democracy keeps our country together. These three arguments were about the effects of democracy on the quality of government and social life. But the strongest argument for democracy is not about what democracy does to the government. It is about what democracy does to the citizens. Even if democracy does not bring about better decisions and accountable government, it is still better than other forms of government. Democracy enhances the dignity of citizens.

People are not subjects of a ruler, they are the rulers themselves. Even when they make mistakes, they are responsible for their conduct. Finally, democracy is better than other forms of government because it allows us to correct its own mistakes. As we saw above, there is no guarantee that mistakes cannot be made in democracy. No form of government can guarantee that. The advantage in a democracy is that such mistakes cannot be hidden for long. There is a space for public discussion on these mistakes. And there is a room for correction. Either the rulers have to change their decisions, or the rulers can be changed. This cannot happen in a non-democratic government. Let us sum it up. Democracy cannot get us everything and is not the solution to all problems. But it is clearly better than any other alternative that we know. It offers better chances of a good decision, it is likely to respect people’s own wishes and allows different kinds of people to live together. Even when it fails to do some of these things, it allows a way of correcting its mistakes and offers more dignity to all citizens. That is why democracy is considered the best form of government.

We have understood democracy as a form of government. This way of defining democracy helps us to identify a clear set of minimal features that a democracy must have. The most common form that democracy takes in our times is that of a representative democracy. You have already read about this in the previous classes. In the countries we call democracy, all the people do not rule. A majority is allowed to take decisions on behalf of all the people. Even the majority does not rule directly. The majority of people rule through their elected representatives. This become necessary because: < Modern democracies involve such a large number of people that it is physically impossible for them to sit together and take a collective decision. < Even if they could, the citizen does not have the time, the desire or the skills to take part in all the decisions.

{"id": "class 9__sst__p28__c1", "text": "14 DEMOCRATIC POLITICS allow us to see the operation of democracy beyond government. For this we need to turn to broader meanings of democracy. Sometimes we use democracy for organisations other than the government. Just read these statements: < “We are a very democratic family. Whenever a decision has to be taken, we all sit down and arrive at a consensus. My opinion matters as much as my father’s.” < “I don’t like teachers who do not allow students to speak and ask questions in the class. I would like to have teachers with democratic temperament.” < “One leader and his family members decide everything in this party. How can they talk of democracy?” These ways of using the word democracy go back to its basic sense of a method of taking decisions. A democratic decision involves consultation with and consent of all those who are affected by that decision. Those who are not powerful have the same say in taking the decision as those who are powerful. This can apply to a government or a family or any other organisation. Thus democracy is also a principle that can be applied to any sphere of life. Sometimes we use the word democracy not to describe any existing government but to set up an ideal standard that all democracies must aim to become: < “True democracy will come to this country only when no one goes hungry to bed.” < “In a democracy every citizen must be able to play equal role in decision making. For this you don’t need just an equal right to vote. Every citizen needs to have equal information, basic education, equal resources and a lot of commitment.” If we take these ideals seriously, then no country in the world is a democracy. Yet an understanding of democracy as an ideal reminds us of why we value democracy. It enables us to judge an existing democracy and identify its weaknesses. It helps us to distinguish between a minimal democracy and a good democracy. In this book we do not deal much with this expanded notion of democracy. Our focus here is with some core institutional features of democracy as a form of government. Next year you will read more about a democratic society and ways of evaluating our democracy. At this stage we just need to note that democracy can apply to many spheres of life and that democracy can take many forms. There can be various ways of taking decisions in a democratic manner, as long as the basic principle of consultation on an equal basis is accepted. The most common form of democracy in today’s world is rule through people’s elected representatives. We shall read more about that in Chapter 3.

This requires a constant effort to save and strengthen democratic forms of decision-making. What we do as citizens can make a difference to making our country more or less democratic. This is the strength and the weakness of democracy: the fate of the country depends not just on what the rulers do, but mainly on what we, as citizens, do. This is what distinguished democracy from other governments. Other forms of government like monarchy, dictatorship or one-party rule do not require all citizens to take part in politics.

There are certain basic rules that the citizens and the government have to follow. All such rules together are called constitution. As the supreme law of the country, the constitution determines the rights of citizens, the powers of the government and how the government should function. In this chapter we ask some basic questions about the constitutional design of a democracy. Why do we need a constitution? How are the constitutions drawn up? Who designs them and in what way? What are the values that shape the constitutions in democratic states? Once a constitution is accepted, can we make changes later as required by the changing conditions? One recent instance of designing constitution for a democratic state is that of South Africa. We begin this chapter by looking at what happened there and how the South Africans went about this task of designing their constitution. Then we turn to how the Indian Constitution was made, what its foundational values are, and how it provides a good framework for the conduct of citizens’ life and that of the government.

The white Europeans imposed this system on South Africa. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the trading companies from Europe occupied it with arms and force, in the way they occupied India. But unlike India, a large number of ‘whites’ had settled in South Africa and became the local rulers. The system of apartheid divided the people and labelled them on the basis of their skin colour. The native people of South Africa are black in colour. They made up about three-fourth of the population and were called ‘blacks’. Besides these two groups, there were people of mixed races who were called ‘coloured’ and people who migrated from India. The white rulers treated all non- whites as inferiors. The non-whites did not have voting rights. The apartheid system was particularly oppressive for the blacks. They were forbidden from living in white areas.

Since 1950, the blacks, coloured and Indians fought against the apartheid system. They launched protest marches and strikes. The African National Congress (ANC) was the umbrella organisation that led the struggle against the policies of segregation. This included many workers’ unions and the Communist Party. Many sensitive whites also joined the ANC to oppose apartheid and played a leading role in this struggle. Several countries de- nounced apartheid as unjust and racist.

The white regime changed its policies. Discriminatory laws were repealed. Ban on political parties and restrictions on the media were lifted. After 28 years of imprisonment, Nelson Mandela walked out of the jail as a free man. Finally, at the midnight of 26 April 1994, the new national flag of the Republic of South Africa was unfurled marking the newly born democracy in the world. The apartheid government came to an end, paving way for the formation of a multi-racial government. How did this come about? Let us hear Mandela, the first president of this new South Africa, on this extra- ordinary transition: “Historical enemies succeeded in negotiating a peaceful transition from apartheid to democracy exactly because we were prepared to accept the inherent capacity for goodness in the other. My wish is that South Africans never give up on the belief in goodness, that they cherish that faith in human beings is the cornerstone of our democracy.” After the emergence of the new democratic South Africa, black leaders appealed to fellow blacks to forgive the whites for the atrocities they had committed while in power. They said let us build a new South Africa based on equality of all races and men and women, on democratic values, social justice and human rights. The party that ruled through oppression and brutal killings and the party that led the freedom struggle sat together to draw up a common constitution. After two years of discussion and debate they came out with one of the finest constitutions the world has ever had. This constitution gave to its citizens the most extensive rights available in any country. Together, they decided that in the search for a solution to the problems, nobody should be excluded, no one should be treated as a demon. They agreed that everybody should become part of the solution, whatever they might have done or represented in the past. The preamble to the South African Constitution (see page 28) sums up this spirit.

A state denounced by the entire world till 1994 as the most undemocratic one is now seen as a model of democracy. What made this change possible was the determination of the people of South Africa to work together, to transform bitter experiences into the binding glue of a rainbow nation. Speaking on the South African Constitution, Mandela said: “The Constitution of South Africa speaks of both the past and the future. On the one hand, it is a solemn pact in which we, as South Africans, declare to one another that we shall never permit a repetition of our racist, brutal and repressive past. But it is more than that. It is also a charter for the transformation of our country into one which is truly shared by all its people — a country which in the fullest sense belongs to all of us, black and white, women and men.” This image captures the spirit of South Africa today.

The South African example is a good way to understand why we need a constitution and what do constitutions do. The oppressor and the oppressed in this new democracy were planning to live together as equals. It was not going to be easy for them to trust each other. They had their fears. They wanted to safeguard their interests. The black majority was keen to ensure that the democratic principle of majority rule was not compromised. They wanted substantial social and economic rights. The white minority was keen to protect its privileges and property.

{"id": "class 9__sst__p36__c1", "text": "22 DEMOCRATIC POLITICS After long negotiations both parties agreed to a compromise. The whites agreed to the principle of majority rule and that of one person one vote. They also agreed to accept some basic rights for the poor and the workers. The blacks agreed that majority rule would not be absolute. They agreed that the majority would not take away the property of the white minority. This compromise was not easy. How was this compromise going to be implemented? Even if they managed to trust each other, what was the guarantee that this trust will not be broken in future? The only way to build and maintain trust in such a situation is to write down some rules of the game that everyone would abide by. These rules lay down how the rulers are to be chosen in future. These rules also determine what the elected governments are empowered to do and what they cannot do. Finally these rules decide the rights of the citizen. These rules will work only if the winner cannot change them very easily. This is what the South Africans did. They agreed on some basic rules. They also agreed that these rules will be supreme, that no government will be able to ignore these. This set of basic rules is called a constitution. Constitution making is not unique to South Africa. Every country has diverse groups of people. Their relationship may not have been as bad as that between the whites and the blacks in South Africa. But all over the world people have differences of opinion and interests. Whether democratic or not, most countries in the world need to have these basic rules. This applies not just to governments. Any association needs to have its constitution. It could be a club in your area, a cooperative society or a political party, they all need a constitution. A C T I V I T Y Approach a club or cooperative society or union or political party in your locality. Get a copy of their rule book (it is often called Rules of Association) and read it. Are these rules in accordance with principles of democracy? Do they give membership to any person without discrimination? Thus, the constitution of a country is a set of written rules that are accepted by all people living together in a country. Constitution is the supreme law that determines the relationship among people living in a territory (called citizens) and also the relationship between the people and government. A constitution does many things: < First, it generates a degree of trust and coordination that is necessary for different kind of people to live together; < Second, it specifies how the government will be constituted, who will have power to take which decisions; < Third, it lays down limits on the powers of the government and tells us what the rights of the citizens are; and < Fourth, it expresses the aspirations of the people about creating a good society. All countries that have constitutions are not necessarily democratic. But all countries that are democratic will have constitutions. After the War of Independence against Great Britain, the Americans gave themselves a constitution. After the Revolution, the French people approved a democratic constitution. Since then it has become a practice in all democracies to have a written constitution. This is not fair!

Our national movement was not merely a struggle against a foreign rule. It was also a struggle to rejuvenate our country and to transform our society and politics. There were sharp differences of opinion within the freedom struggle about the path India should take after Independence. Such differences exist even today. Yet some basic ideas had come to be accepted by almost everyone. As far back as in 1928, Motilal Nehru and eight other Congress leaders drafted a constitution for India. In 1931, the resolution at the Karachi session of the Indian National Congress dwelt on how independent India’s constitution should look like. Both these documents were committed to the inclusion of universal adult franchise, right to freedom and equality and to protecting the rights of minorities in the constitution of independent India. Thus some basic values were accepted by all leaders much before the Constituent Assembly met to deliberate on the Constitution. The familiarity with political institutions of colonial rule also helped develop an agreement over the institutional design. The British rule had given voting rights only to a few. On that basis the British had introduced very weak legislatures. Elections were held in 1937 to Provincial Legislatures and Ministries all over British India. These were not fully democratic governments. But the experience gained by Indians in the working of the legislative institutions proved to be very useful for the country in setting up its own institutions and Like South Africa, India’s Constitution was also drawn up under very difficult circumstances. The making of the constitution for a huge and diverse country like India was not an easy affair. At that time the people of India were emerging from the status of subjects to that of citizens. The country was born through a partition on the basis of religious differences. This was a traumatic experience for the people of India and Pakistan. Atleast ten lakh people were killed on both sides of the border in partition related violence. There was another problem. The British had left it to the rulers of the princely states to decide whether they wanted to merge with India or with Pakistan or remain independent. The merger of these princely states was a difficult and uncertain task. When the constitution was being written, the future of the country did not look as secure as it does today. The makers of the constitution had anxieties about the present and the future of the country. A C T I V I T Y Speak to your grandparents or some other elders in your locality.

That is why the Indian constitution adopted many institutional details and procedures from colonial laws like the Government of India Act, 1935. Years of thinking and deliberation on the framework of the constitution had another benefit. Our leaders gained confidence to learn from other countries, but on our own terms. Many of our leaders were inspired by the ideals of French Revolution, the practice of parliamentary democracy in Britain and the Bill of Rights in the US. The socialist revolution in Russia had inspired many Indians to think of shaping a system based on social and economic equality. Yet they were not simply imitating what others had done. At each step they were questioning whether these things suited our country. All these factors contributed to the making of our Constitution.

Write a short note on him or her, following the same style as used here: Name (year of birth-year of death), place of birth (by current political boundaries), brief description of political activities; role played after the Constituent Assembly. The drafting of the document called the constitution was done by an assembly of elected representatives called the Constituent Assembly. Elections to the Constituent Assembly were held in July 1946. Its first meeting was held in December 1946. Soon after, the country was divided into India and Pakistan. The Constituent Assembly was also divided into the Constituent Assembly of India and that of Pakistan. The Constituent Assembly that wrote the Indian constitution had 299 members. The Assembly adopted the Constitution on 26 November 1949 but it came into effect on 26 January 1950. To mark this day we celebrate January 26 as Republic Day every year. Why should we accept the Constitution made by this Assembly more than seven decades ago? We have already noted one reason above. The Constitution does not reflect the views of its members alone. It expresses a broad consensus of its time. Many countries of the world have had to rewrite their Constitution afresh because the basic rules were not acceptable to all major social groups or political parties. In some other countries, the Constitution exists as a mere piece of paper. No one actually follows it. The experience of our Constitution is different. Over the last half a century, several groups have questioned some provisions of the Constitution. But no large social group or political party has ever questioned the legitimacy of the Constitution itself. This is an unusual achievement for any constitution. The second reason for accepting the Constitution is that the Constituent Assembly represented the people of India. There was no universal adult franchise at that time. So the Constituent Assembly could not have been chosen directly by all the people of India. It was Rajendra Prasad Rajendra Prasad Rajendra Prasad Rajendra Prasad Rajendra Prasad (1884-1963) born: Bihar. President of the Constituent Assembly.

This ensured a fair geographical share of members from all the regions of the country. The Assembly was dominated by the Indian National Congress, the party that led India’s freedom struggle. But the Congress itself included a variety of political groups and opinions. The Assembly had many members who did not agree with the Congress. In social terms too, the Assembly represented members from different language groups, castes, classes, religions and occupations. Even if the Constituent Assembly was elected by universal adult franchise, its composition would not have been very different. Finally, the manner in which the Constituent Assembly worked gives sanctity to the Constitution. The Constituent Assembly worked in a systematic, open and consensual manner. First some basic principles were decided and agreed upon. Then a Drafting Committee chaired by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar prepared a draft constitution for discussion. Several rounds of thorough discussion took place on the Draft Constitution, clause by clause. More than two thousand amendments were considered. The members deliberated for 114 days spread over three years. Every document presented and every word spoken in the Constituent Assembly has been recorded and preserved. These are called ‘Constituent Assembly Debates’. When printed, these debates are 12 bulky volumes! These debates provide the rationale behind every provision of the Constitution.

At this stage let us begin by understanding the overall philosophy of what our Constitution is all about. We can do this in two ways. We can understand it by reading the views of some of our major leaders on our Constitution. But it is equally important to read what the Constitution says about its own philosophy.

There can be no room in such an India for the curse of untouchability or the curse of the intoxicating drinks and drugs. Women will enjoy the same rights as men … I shall be satisfied with nothing else. This dream of an India that has eliminated inequality was shared by Dr. Ambedkar, who played a key role in the making of the Constitution but he had a different understanding of how inequalities could be removed. He often bitterly criticised Mahatma Gandhi and his vision. In his conclud- ing speech to the Constituent Assem bly he stated his anxiety very clearly: On the 26th of January 1950 we are going to enter a life of contradictions. In politics we will have equality and in social and economic life we will have inequality. In politics we will be recognising the principle of one man one vote and one vote one value. In our social and economic life, we shall, by reason of our social and economic structure, continue to deny the principle of one man one value. How long shall we continue to live this life of contradictions? How long shall we continue to deny equality in our social and economic life? If we continue to deny it for long, we will do so only by putting our political democracy in peril.

It provides a standard to examine and evaluate any law and action of government, to find out whether it is good or bad. It is the soul of the Indian Constitution.

Institutional design Institutional design Institutional design Institutional design Institutional design A constitution is not merely a statement of values and philosophy. As we noted above, a constitution is mainly about embodying these values into institutional arrangements. Much of the document called Constitution of India is about these arrangements. It is a very long and detailed document. Therefore it needs to be amended quite regularly to keep it updated. Those who crafted the Indian Constitution felt that it has to be in accordance with people’s aspirations and changes in society. They did not see it as a sacred, static and unalterable law. So, they made provisions to incorporate changes from time to time. These changes are called constitutional amendments. The Constitution describes the institutional arrangements in a very legal language. If you read the Constitution for the first time, it can be quite difficult to understand. Yet the basic institutional design is not very difficult to understand. Like any Constitution, the Indian Constitution lays down a procedure for choosing persons to govern the country. It defines who will have how much power to take which decisions. And it puts limits to what the government can do by providing some rights to the citizen that cannot be violated. The remaining three chapters in this book are about these three aspects of the working of Indian constitution. We shall look at some key constitutional provisions in each chapter and understand how they work in democratic politics. But this textbook will not cover all the salient features of the institutional design in the Indian Constitution. Some other aspects will be covered in your textbook next year.

The most common form of democracy in our times is for the people to govern through their representatives. In this chapter we will look at how these representatives are elected. We begin by understanding why elections are necessary and useful in a democracy. We try to understand how electoral competition among parties serves the people. We then go on to ask what makes an election democratic. The basic idea here is to distinguish democratic elections from non-democratic elections. The rest of the chapter tries to assess elections in India in the light of this yardstick. We take a look at each stage of elections, from the drawing of boundaries of different constituencies to the declaration of results. At each stage we ask what should happen and what does happen in elections. Towards the end of the chapter, we turn to an assessment of whether elections in India are free and fair. Here we also examine the role of the Election Commission in ensuring free and fair elections. CHAPTER 3 Electoral Politics Reprint 2025-26"}

The people were unhappy with the existing government. They were also attracted by Devi Lal’s promise. So, when elections were held, they voted overwhelmingly in favour of Lok Dal and its allies. Lok Dal and its partners won 76 out of 90 seats in the State Assembly. Lok Dal alone won 60 seats and thus had a clear majority in the Assembly. The Congress could win only 5 seats. Once the election results were announced, the sitting Chief Minister resigned. The newly elected Members of Legislative Assembly (MLAs) of Lok Dal chose Devi Lal as their leader. The Governor invited Devi Lal to be the new Chief Minister. Three days after the election results were declared, he became the Chief Minister. As soon as he became the Chief Minister, his Government issued a Government Order waiving the outstanding loans of small farmers, agricultural labourers and small businessmen.

There are more than one hundred countries in the world in which elections take place to choose people’s representatives. We also read that elections are held in many countries that are not democratic. But why do we need elections? Let us try to imagine a democracy without elections. A rule of the people is possible without any elections if all the people can sit together everyday and take all the decisions. But as we have already seen in Chapter 1, this is not possible in any large community. Nor is it possible for everyone to have the time and knowledge to take decisions on all matters. Therefore in most democracies people rule through their representatives. Is there a democratic way of selecting representatives without elections? Let us think of a place where representatives are selected on the basis of age and experience. Or a place where they are chosen on the basis of education or knowledge. There could be some difficulty in deciding on who is more experienced or knowledgable. But let us say the people can resolve these difficulties. Clearly, such a place does not require elections. But can we call this place a democracy? How do we find out if the people like their representatives or not? How do we ensure that these representatives rule as per the wishes of the people? How to make sure that those who the people don’t like do not remain their representatives? This requires a mechanism by which people can choose their representatives at regular intervals and change them if they wish to do so. This mechanism is called election. Therefore, elections are considered essential in our times for any representative democracy. In an election the voters make many choices: < They can choose who will make laws for them. < They can choose who will form the government and take major decisions. < They can choose the party whose policies will guide the government and law making.

Elections can be held in many ways. All democratic countries hold elections. But most non-democratic countries also hold some kind of elections. How do we distinguish democratic elections from any other election? We have discussed this question briefly in Chapter 1. We discussed many examples of countries where elections are held but they can’t really be called democratic elections. Let us recall what we learnt there and start with a simple list of the minimum conditions of a democratic election: < First, everyone should be able to choose. This means that everyone should have one vote and every vote should have equal value. We have seen why democracies need to have elections. But why do rulers in non-democratic countries need to hold elections? Reprint 2025-26"}

These might look like very simple and easy conditions. But there are many countries where these are not fulfilled.

Is it good t s it good t s it good t s it good t s it good to ha o ha o ha o ha o have political e political e political e political e political competition? ompetition? ompetition? ompetition? ompetition? Elections are thus all about political competition. This competition takes various forms. The most obvious form is the competition among political parties. At the constituency level, it takes the form of competition among several candidates. If there is no competition, elections will become pointless. But is it good to have political competition? Clearly, an electoral competition has many demerits. It creates a sense of disunity and ‘factionalism’ in every locality. You would have heard of people complaining of ‘party-politics’ in your locality. Different political parties and leaders often level allegations against one another. Parties and candidates often use dirty tricks to win elections. Some people say that this pressure to win electoral fights does not allow sensible long-term policies to be formulated. Some good people who may wish to serve the country do not enter this arena. They do not like the idea of being dragged into unhealthy competition. Our Constitution makers were aware of these problems. Yet they opted for free competition in elections as the way to select our future leaders. They did so because this system works better in the long run. In an ideal world all political leaders know what is good for the people and are motivated only by a desire to serve them. Political competition is not necessary in such an ideal world. But that is not what happens in real life. Political leaders all over the world, like all other professionals, are motivated by a desire to advance their political careers. They want to remain in power or get power and positions for themselves.They may wish to serve the people as well, but it is risky to depend entirely on their sense of duty. Besides even when they wish to serve the people, they may not know what is required to do so, or their ideas may not match what the people really want. How do we deal with this real life situation? One way is to try and improve the knowledge and character of political leaders. The other and more realistic way is to set up a system where political leaders are rewarded for serving the people and punished for not doing so. Who decides this reward or punishment? The simple answer is: the people. This is what electoral competition does. Regular electoral competition provides incentives to political parties and leaders. They know that if they raise issues that people want to be raised, their popularity and chances of victory will increase in the next elections. But if they fail to satisfy the voters with their work they will not be able to win again. Ah! So, elections are like exams where politicians and parties know if they have passed or failed.

Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha (Assembly) elections are held regularly after every five years. After five years the term of all the elected representatives comes to an end. The Lok Sabha or Vidhan Sabha stands ‘dissolved’. Elections are held in all constituencies at the same time, either on the same day or within a few days. This is called a general election. Sometimes election is held only for one constitutency to fill the vacancy caused by death or resignation of a member. This is called a by-election. In this chapter we will focus on general elections.

You may have wondered how they did that. Did every person in Haryana vote for all the 90 MLAs? You perhaps know that this is not the case. In our country we follow an area based system of representation. The country is divided into different areas for purposes of elections. These areas are called electoral constitutencies. The voters who live in an area elect one representative. So if a political party is motivated only by desire to be in power, even then it will be forced to serve the people. This is a bit like the way market works. Even if a shopkeeper is interested only in his profit, he is forced to give good service to the customers. If he does not, the customer will go to some other shop. Similarly, political competition may cause divisions and some ugliness, but it finally helps to force political parties and leaders to serve the people. 3.2 WHAT IS OUR SYSTEM OF ELECTIONS?

The representative elected from each constituency is called a Member of Parliament or an MP. One of the features of a democratic election is that every vote should have equal value. That is why our Constitution requires that each constituency should have a roughly equal population living within it. Similarly, each state is divided into a specific number of Assembly constituencies. In this case, the elected representative is called the Member of Legislative Assembly or an MLA. Each Parliamentary GULBARGA (KALABURAGI) DISTRICT IN KARNATAKA constituency has within it several assembly constituencies. The same principle applies for Panchayat and Municipal elections. Each village or town is divided into several ‘wards’ that are like constituencies. Each ward elects one member of the village or the urban local body. Sometimes these constituencies are counted as ‘seats’, for each constituency represents one seat in the assembly. When we say that ‘Lok Dal won 60 seats’ in Haryana, it means that candidates of Lok Dal won in 60 assembly constituencies in the state and thus Lok Dal had 60 MLAs in the state assembly.

The Constitution makers, however, were worried that in an open electoral competition, certain weaker sections may not stand a good chance to get elected to the Lok Sabha and the state Legislative Assemblies. They may not have the required resources, education and contacts to contest and win elections against others. Those who are influential and resourceful may prevent them from winning elections. If that happens, our Parliament and Assemblies would be deprived of the voice of a significant section of our population. That would make our democracy less representative and less democratic. So, the makers of our Constitution thought of a special system of reserved constituencies for the weaker sections. Some constituencies are reserved for people who belong to the Scheduled Castes [SC] and Scheduled Tribes [ST]. In a SC reserved constituency only someone who belongs to the Scheduled Castes can stand for election. Similarly only those belonging to the Scheduled Tribes can contest an election from a constituency reserved for ST. Currently, in the Lok Sabha, 84 seats are reserved for the Scheduled Castes and 47 for the Scheduled Tribes (as on 26 January 2019). This number is in proportion to their share in the total population. Thus the reserved seats for SC and ST do not take away the legitimate share of any other social group. This system of reservation was extended later to other weaker sections at the district and local level. In many states, seats in rural (panchayat) and urban (municipalities and corporations) local bodies are now reserved for Other Backward Classes (OBC) as well. However, the proportion of seats reserved varies from state to state. Similarly, one-third of the seats are reserved in rural and urban local bodies for women candidates.

This decision cannot be left to anyone till the last day. In a democratic election, the list of those who are eligible to vote is prepared much before the election and given to everyone. This list is officially called the Electoral Roll and is commonly known as the Voters’ List. This is an important step for it is linked to the first condition of a democratic election: everyone should get an equal opportunity to choose representatives. Earlier, we read about the principle of universal adult franchise. In practice it means that everyone should have one vote and each vote should have equal value. No one should be denied the right to vote without a good reason. Different citizens differ from one another in many ways: some are rich, some are poor; some are highly educated, some are not so educated or not educated at all; some are kind, others are not so kind. But all of them are human beings with their own needs and views. That is why all of them deserve to have an equal say in decisions that affect them. In our country, all the citizens aged 18 years and above can vote in an election. Every citizen has the right to vote, regardless of his or her caste, religion or gender.

An agent of each candidate is allowed to sit inside the polling booth and ensure that the voting takes place in a fair way. ELECTORAL POLITICS Are the elections too expensive for our country? A large amount of money is spent in conducting elections in India. For instance, the government spent about `3,500 crores in conducting Lok Sabha elections in 2014. That works out to about `40 per person on the voters’ list. The amount spent by parties and candidates was more than what the government spent. Roughly speaking, the expenditure made by government, parties and candidates was around `30,000 crores or `500 per voter. Some people say that elections are a burden on our people, that our poor country cannot afford to hold elections once every five years. Let us compare this expenditure with some other figures: < In 2005, our government decided to buy six nuclear submarines from France. Each subma- rine cost about `3,000 crores. < Delhi hosted the Commonwealth Games in 2010. The estimate for its cost is around `20,000 crores. Are the elections too expensive? You decide.

A ballot paper is a sheet of paper on which the names of the contesting candidates along with party name and symbols are listed. Nowadays electronic voting machines (EVM) are used to record votes. The machine shows the names of the candidates and the party symbols. Independent candidates too have their own symbols, allotted by election commission. All that the voter has to do is to press the button against the name of the candidate she wants to give her vote.

Of these 9.98 lakh voters had cast their votes. The candidate of the Congress party, Mallikarjun Kharge secured about 5.07 lakh votes. This was 50.82 percent of the total votes polled.

But once appointed, the Chief Election Commissioner is not answerable to the President or the government. Even if the ruling party or the government does not like what the Commission does, it is virtually impossible for it to remove the CEC. Very few election commissions in the world have such wide-ranging powers as the Election Commission of India. < EC takes decisions on every aspect of conduct and control of elections from the announcement of elections to the declaration of results. < It implements the Code of Conduct and punishes any candidate or party that violates it. < During the election period, the EC can order the government to follow some guidelines, to prevent use and misuse of governmental power to enhance its chances to win elections, or to transfer some government officials. < When on election duty, govern- ment officers work under the con- trol of the EC and not the govern- ment. In the last 25 years or so, the Election Commission has begun to exercise all its powers and even expand them. It is very common now for the Election Commission to reprimand the government and administration for their lapses. When election officials come to the opinion that polling was not fair in some booths or even an entire constituency, they order a repoll. The ruling parties often do not like what the EC does. But they have to obey. This would not have happened if the EC was not independent and powerful. ELECTORAL POLITICS We get to read a lot about unfair practices in elections. Newspapers and television reports often refer to such allegations. Most of these reports are about the following: < Inclusion of false names and exclusion of genuine names in the voters’ list; < Misuse of government facilities and officials by the ruling party; < Excessive use of money by rich candidates and big parties; and < Intimidation of voters and rigging on the polling day. Many of these reports are correct. We feel unhappy when we read or see such reports. But fortunately they are not on such a scale so as to defeat the very purpose of elections. This becomes clear if we ask a basic question: Can a party win an election and come to power not because it has popular support but through electoral malpractices? This is a vital question. Let us carefully examine various aspects of this question. Independen Independen Independen Independen Independent Ele t Ele t Ele t Ele t Election tion tion tion tion Commission ommission ommission ommission ommission One simple way of checking whether elections are fair or not is to look at who conducts the elections. Are they independent of the government? Or can the government or the ruling party influence or pressurise them? Do they have enough powers to be able to conduct free and fair elections? Do they actually use these powers? The answer to all these questions is quite positive for our country. In our country elections are conducted by an independent and very powerful Election Commission (EC). It enjoys the same kind of independence that the judiciary enjoys.

They have to work with and within institutions. This chapter is about the working of such institutions in a democracy. We try to understand this by looking at the manner in which major decisions are taken and implemented in our country. We also look at how disputes regarding these decisions are resolved. In this process we come across three institutions that play a key role in major decisions – legislature, executive and judiciary. You have already read something about these institutions in earlier classes. Here we shall quickly summarise those and move on to asking larger questions. In the case of each institution we ask: What does this institution do? How is this institution connected to other institutions? What makes its functioning more or less democratic? The basic objective here is to understand how all these institutions together carry on the work of government. Sometimes we compare these with similar institutions in other democracies. In this chapter we take our examples from the working of the national level government called Central Government, Union Government, or just Government of India.

We can guess that such a major decision would have involved other major functionaries in our country. You have already read in the previous class about some of them. Let us go over some of the main points that you covered then: < President is the head of the state and is the highest formal authority in the country. < Prime Minister is the head of the government and actually exercises all governmental powers.

This Office Memorandum was the culmination of a long chain of events. The Government of India had appointed the Second Backward Classes Commission in 1979. It was headed by B.P. Mandal. Hence it was popularly called the Mandal Commission. It was asked to determine the criteria to identify the socially and educationally backward classes in India and recommend steps to be taken for their advancement. The Commission gave its Report in 1980 and made many recommendations. One of these was that 27 per cent of government jobs be reserved for the socially and educationally backward classes. The Report and recommendations were discussed in the Parliament. For several years, many parliamentarians and parties kept demanding the implementation of the Commission’s recommendations. Then came the Lok Sabha election of 1989. In its election manifesto, the Janata Dal promised that if voted to power, it would implement the Mandal Commission report. The Janata Dal did form the government after this election. Its leader V. P. Singh became the Prime Minister. Several developments took place after that: Now I can see clearly!

People reacted strongly because this decision affected thousands of job opportunities. Some felt that existence of inequalities among people of different castes in India necessitated job reservations. They felt, this would give a fair opportunity to those communities who so far had not adequately been represented in government employment. Others felt that this was unfair as it would deny equality of opportunity to those who did not belong to backward communities. They would be denied jobs even though they could be more qualified. Some felt that this would perpetuate caste feelings among people and hamper national unity. In this chapter we won’t discuss whether the decision was good or not. We only take this example to understand how major decisions are taken and implemented in the country. Who resolved this dispute? You know that the Supreme Court and the High Courts in India settle disputes arising out of governmental decisions. Some persons and associations opposed to this order filed a number of cases in the courts. They appealed to the courts to declare the order invalid and stop its implementation. The Supreme Court of India bunched all these cases together. This case was known as the ‘Indira Sawhney and others Vs Union of India case’. Eleven judges of the Supreme Court heard arguments of both sides. By a majority, the Supreme Court judges in 1992 declared that this order of the Government of India was valid. At the same time the Supreme Court asked the government to modify its WORKING OF INSTITUTIONS < The President of India in his address to the Parliament announced the intention of the government to implement the recommendations of the Mandal Commission. < On 6 August 1990, the Union Cabinet took a formal decision to implement the recommendations. < Next day Prime Minister V.P.

Governing a country involves various such activities. For example, the government is responsible for ensuring security to the citizens and providing facilities for education and health to all. It collects taxes and spends the money thus raised on administration, defence and development programmes. It formulates and implements several welfare schemes. Some persons have to take decisions on how to go about these activities. Others have to implement these decisions. If disputes arise on these decisions or in their implementation, there should be someone to determine what is right and what is wrong. It is important that everyone should know who is responsible for doing what. It is also important that these activities keep taking place even if the persons in key positions change. So, to attend to all these tasks, several arrangements are made in all modern democracies. Such arrangements are called institutions. A democracy works well when these institutions perform functions assigned to them. The Constitution of any country lays down basic rules on the powers and functions of each institution. In the example above, we saw several such institutions at work. < The Prime Minister and the Cabinet are institutions that take all important policy decisions. < The Civil Servants, working together, are responsible for taking steps to implement the ministers’ decisions. < Supreme Court is an institution where disputes between citizens and the government are finally settled. Can you think of some other insti- tutions in this example? What is their role? Working with institutions is not easy. Institutions involve rules and regulations. This can bind the hands of leaders. Institutions involve meetings, committees and routines. This often leads to delays and complications. Therefore dealing with institutions can be frustrating. One might feel that it is much better to have one person take all decisions without any rules, procedures and meetings. But that is not the spirit of democracy.

In all democracies, an assembly of elected representatives exercises supreme political authority on behalf of the people. In India such a national assembly of elected representatives is called Parliament. At the state level this is called Legislature or Legislative Assembly. The name may vary in different countries, but such an assembly exists in every democracy. It exercises political authority on behalf of the people in many ways: 1 Parliament is the final authority for making laws in any country. This task of law making or legislation is so crucial that these assemblies are called legislatures. Parliaments all over the world can make new laws, change existing laws, or abolish existing laws and make new ones in their place. 2 Parliaments all over the world exercise some control over those who run the government. In some countries like India this control is direct and full. Those who run the government can take decisions only so long as they enjoy support of Parliament. 3 Parliaments control all the money that governments have. In most countries the public money can be spent only when Parliament sanctions it. through a bad decision. That is why democratic governments insist on institutions. 4.2 PARLIAMENT In the example of the Office Memorandum, do you remember the role of Parliament? Perhaps not. Since this decision was not taken by Parliament, you might think that Parliament had no role in it. But let us go back to the story and see whether Parliament figures in it. Let us recall the points made earlier by completing the following sentences: < The Report of the Mandal Commission was discussed … < The President of India mentioned this in his … < The Prime Minister made a … The decision was not directly taken in Parliament. But Parliamentary discussions on the Report influenced and shaped the decision of the government. They brought pressure on the government to act on the Mandal recommendation.

Two H o H o H o H o Houses of P ouses of P ouses of P ouses of P ouses of Parararararliamen liamen liamen liamen liament Since Parliament plays a central role in modern democracies, most large countries divide the role and powers of Parliament in two parts. They are called Chambers or Houses. One House is usually directly elected by the people and exercises the real power on behalf of the people. The second House is usually elected indirectly and performs some special functions. The most common work for the second House is to look after the interests of various states, regions or federal units. In our country, Parliament consists of two Houses. The two Houses are known as the Council of States (Rajya Sabha) and the House of the People (Lok Sabha). The President of India is a part of Parliament, although she is not a member of either House. That is why all laws made in the Houses come into force only after they receive the assent of the President. You have read about the Indian Parliament in earlier classes. From the Chapter 3 you know how Lok Sabha elections take place. Let us recall some key differences between the composition of these two Houses of Parliament. Answer the following for the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha: < What is the total number of members? … < Who elects the members? … < What is the length of the term (in years)? … < Can the House be dissolved or is it permanent? … What is the point in having so much debate and discussion in the Parliament when we know that the view of the ruling party is going to prevail? Which of the two Houses is more powerful? It might appear that the Rajya Sabha is more powerful, for sometimes it is called the ‘Upper Chamber’ and the Lok Sabha the ‘Lower Chamber’. But this does not mean that Rajya Sabha is more powerful than Lok Sabha. This is just an old style of speaking and not the language used in our Constitution. Our Constitution does give the Rajya Sabha some special powers over the states. But on most matters, the Lok Sabha exercises supreme power. Let us see how: 1 Any ordinary law needs to be passed by both the Houses. But if there is a difference between the two Houses, the final decision is taken in a joint session in which members of both the Houses sit together. Because of the larger number of members, the view of the Lok Sabha is likely to prevail in such a meeting. 2 Lok Sabha exercises more powers in money matters. Once the Lok Sabha passes the budget of the government or any other money related law, the Rajya Sabha cannot reject it. The Rajya Sabha can only delay it by 14 days or suggest changes in it. The Lok Sabha may or may not accept these changes.

We found out that the person who signed the document did not take this decision. He was only executing the policy decision taken by someone else. We noted the role of the Prime Minister in taking that decision. But we also know that he could not have taken that decision if he did not have support from the Lok Sabha. In that sense he was only executing the wishes of the Parliament. Thus, at different levels of any government we find functionaries who take day-to-day decisions but do not exercise supreme power on behalf of the people. All those functionaries are collectively known as the executive. They are called executive because they are in charge of the ‘execution’ of the policies of the government. Thus, when we talk about ‘the government’ we usually mean the executive. Political and P olitical and P olitical and P olitical and P olitical and Pererererermanen manen manen manen manent Executiv utiv utiv utiv utive In a democratic country, two categories make up the executive. One that is elected by the people for a specific period, is called the political executive. Political leaders who take the big decisions fall in this category. In the second category, people are appointed on a long-term basis. This is called the permanent executive or civil services. Persons working in civil services are called civil servants. They remain in office even when the ruling party changes. These officers work under political executive and assist them in carrying out the day-to-day administration. Can you recall the role of political and non-political executive in the case of the Office Memorandum? You might ask: Why does the political executive have more power than the non-political executive? Why is the minister more powerful than the civil servant? The civil servant is usually more educated and has more expert knowledge of the subject. The advisors working in the Finance Ministry know more about economics than the Finance Minister. Sometimes the ministers may know very little about the technical matters that come under their ministry. This could easily happen in ministries like Defence, Industry, Health, Science and Technology, Mines, etc. Why should the minister have the final say on these matters? The reason is very simple. In a democracy the will of the people is supreme. The minister is an elected representative of the people and thus empowered to exercise the will of the people on their behalf. She is finally answerable to the people for all the consequences of her decision. That is why the minister takes all the final decisions. The minister decides the overall framework and objectives in which decisions on policy should be made. The minister is not, and is not expected to be, an expert in the matters of her ministry. The minister takes the advice of experts on all technical matters. But very often experts hold different opinions or place before her more than one option.

Yet there is no direct election to the post of the Prime Minister. The President appoints the Prime Minister. But the President cannot appoint anyone she likes. The President appoints the leader of the majority party or the coalition of parties that commands a majority in the Lok Sabha, as Prime Minister. In case no single party or alliance gets a majority, the President appoints the person most likely to secure a majority support. The Prime Minister does not have a fixed tenure. He continues in power so long as he remains the leader of the majority party or coalition. After the appointment of the Prime Minister, the President appoints other ministers on the advice of the Prime Minister. The Ministers are usually from the party or the coalition that has the majority in the Lok Sabha. The Prime Minister is free to choose ministers, as long as they are members of Parliament. Sometimes, a person who is not a member of Parliament can also become a minister. But such a person has to get elected to one of the Houses of Parliament within six months of appointment as minister. Council of Ministers is the official name for the body that includes all the Ministers. It usually has 60 to 80 Ministers of different ranks. < Cabinet Ministers are usually top- level leaders of the ruling party or parties who are in charge of the major ministries. Usually the Cabinet Ministers meet to take decisions in the name of the Council of Ministers. Cabinet is thus the inner ring of the Council of Ministers. It comprises about 25 ministers. < Ministers of State with indepen- dent charge are usually in-charge of smaller Ministries. They participate in the Cabinet meet- ings only when specially invited. < Ministers of State are attached to and required to assist Cabinet Ministers. Since it is not practical for all ministers to meet regularly and discuss everything, the decisions are taken in Cabinet meetings. That is why parliamentary democracy in most countries is often known as the Cabinet form of government. The Cabinet works as a team. The ministers may have different views and opinions, but everyone has to own up to every decision of the Cabinet. WORKING OF INSTITUTIONS The race to become minister is not new.

But as head of the government, the Prime Minister has wide ranging powers. He chairs Cabinet meetings. He coordinates the work of different Departments. His decisions are final in case disagreements arise between Departments. He exercises general supervision of different ministries. All ministers work under his leadership. The Prime Minister distributes and redistributes work to the ministers. He also has the power to dismiss ministers. When the Prime Minister quits, the entire ministry quits. Thus, if the Cabinet is the most powerful institution in India, within the Cabinet it is the Prime Minister who is the most powerful. The powers of the Prime Minister in all parliamentary democracies of the world have increased so much in recent decades that parliamentary democracies are some times seen as Prime Ministerial form of government. As political parties have come to play a major role in politics, the Prime Minister controls the Cabinet and Parliament through the party. The media also contributes to this trend by making politics and elections as a competition between top leaders of parties. In India too we have seen such a tendency towards the concentration of powers in the hands of the Prime Minister. Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, exercised enormous authority because he had great influence over the public. Indira Gandhi was also a very powerful leader compared to her colleagues in the Cabinet. Of course, the extent of power wielded by a Prime Minister also depends on the personality of the person holding that position. However, in recent years the rise of coalition politics has imposed certain constraints on the power of the Prime Minister.

The President The President The President The President The President While the Prime Minister is the head of the government, the President is the head of the State. In our political system the head of the State exercises only nominal powers. The President of India is like the Queen of Britain whose functions are to a large extent ceremonial. The President supervises the overall functioning of all the political institutions in the country so that they operate in harmony to achieve the objectives of the State. The President is not elected directly by the people. The elected Members of Parliament (MPs) and the elected Members of the Legislative Assemblies (MLAs) elect her. A candidate standing for President’s post has to get a majority of votes to win the election. This ensures that the President can be seen to represent the entire nation. At the same time the President can never claim the kind of direct popular mandate that the Prime Minister can. This ensures that she remains only a nominal executive. The same is true of the powers of the President. If you casually read the Constitution you would think that there is nothing that she cannot do.

The President is the supreme commander of the defence forces of India. But we should remember that the President exercises all these powers only on the advice of the Council of Ministers. The President can ask the Council of Ministers to reconsider its advice. But if the same advice is given again, she is bound to act according to it. Similarly, a bill passed by the Parliament becomes a law only after the President gives assent to it. If the President wants, she can delay this for some time and send the bill back to Parliament for reconsideration. But if Parliament passes the bill again, she has to sign it. So you may wonder what does the President really do? Can she do anything on her own at all? There is one very important thing she should do on her own: appoint the Prime Minister. When a party or coalition of parties secures a clear majority in the elections, the President, has to appoint the leader of the majority party or the coalition that enjoys majority support in the Lok Sabha. When no party or coalition gets a majority in the Lok Sabha, the President exercises her discretion. The President appoints a leader who in her opinion can muster majority support in the Lok Sabha. In such a case, the President can ask the newly appointed Prime Minister to prove majority support in the Lok Sabha within a specified time. The Presidential System Presidents all over the world are not always nomi- nal executives like the President of India. In many countries of the world, the President is both the head of the state and the head of the government. The President of the United States of America is the most well known example of this kind of Presi- dent. The US President is directly elected by the people. He personally chooses and appoints all Ministers. The law making is still done by the leg- islature (called the Congress in the US), but the president can veto any law. Most importantly, the president does not need the support of the major- ity of members in the Congress and neither is he answerable to them. He has a fixed tenure of four years and completes it even if his party does not have a majority in the Congress. This model is followed in most of the countries of Latin America and many of the ex-Soviet Union countries. Given the centrality of the President, this system of government is called the Presiden- tial form of government. In countries like ours that follow the British model, the parliament is su- preme. Therefore our system is called the parlia- mentary system of government. Eliamma, Annakutti and Marymol read the section on the President. Each of them had a question.

Did the High Court or the Supreme Court change it? What was the reason? This is why an independent and powerful judiciary is considered essential for democracies. All the courts at different levels in a country put together are called the judiciary. The Indian judiciary consists of a Supreme Court for the entire nation, High Courts in the states, District Courts and the courts at local level. India has an integrated judiciary. It means the Supreme Court controls the judicial administration in the country. Its decisions are binding on all other courts of the country. It can take up any dispute < Between citizens of the country; < Between citizens and government; < Between two or more state governments; and < Between governments at the union and state level. It is the highest court of appeal in civil and criminal cases. It can hear appeals against the decisions of the High Courts. Independence of the judiciary means that it is not under the control of the legislature or the executive. The judges do not act on the direction of the government or according to the wishes of the party in power. That is why all modern democracies have courts that are independent of the legislature and the executive. India has achieved this. The judges of the Supreme Court and the High Courts are appointed by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister and in WORKING OF INSTITUTIONS Let us return, one final time, to the story of Office Memorandum that we started with.

Imagine what would have happened in the following situations: < If there was nothing like a Supreme Court in the country. < Even if there was a Supreme Court, if it had no power to judge actions of the government. < Even if it had the power, if no one trusted the Supreme Court to give a fair verdict. < Even if it gave a fair judgement, if those who appealed against the Government Order did not accept the judgement.

In practice it now means that the senior judges of the Supreme Court select the new judges of the Supreme Court and the High Courts. There is very little scope for interference by the political executive. The senior most judge of the Supreme Court is usually appointed the Chief Justice. Once a person is appointed as judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court it is nearly impossible to remove him or her from that position. It is as difficult as removing the President of India. A judge can be removed only by an impeachment motion passed separately by two-thirds members of the two Houses of the Parliament. It has never happened in the history of Indian democracy. The judiciary in India is also one of the most powerful in the world. The Supreme Court and the High Courts have the power to interpret the Constitution of the country. They can declare invalid any law of the legislature or the actions of the executive, whether at the Union level or at the state level, if they find such a law or action is against the Constitution. Thus they can determine the Constitutional validity of any legislation or action of the executive in the country, when it is challenged before them. This is known as the judicial review. The Supreme Court of India has also ruled that the core or basic principles of the Constitution cannot be changed by the Parliament. The powers and the independence of the Indian judiciary allow it to act as the guardian of the Fundamental Rights. We shall see in the next chapter that the citizens have a right to approach the courts to seek remedy in case of any violation of their rights. In recent years the Courts have given several judgments and directives to protect public interest and human rights. Any one can approach the courts if public interest is hurt by the actions of government. This is called public interest litigation. The courts intervene to prevent the misuse of the government’s power to make decisions. They check malpractices on the part of public officials.

In Chapter 3 we saw how a democratic government has to be periodically elected by the people in a free and fair manner. In Chapter 4 we learnt that a democracy must be based on institutions that follow certain rules and procedures. These elements are necessary but not sufficient for a democracy. Elections and institutions need to be combined with a third element – enjoyment of rights – to make a government democratic. Even the most properly elected rulers working through the established institutional process must learn not to cross some limits. Citizens’ democratic rights set those limits in a democracy. This is what we take up in this final chapter of the book. We begin by discussing some real life cases to imagine what it means to live without rights. This leads to a discussion on what we mean by rights and why do we need them. As in the previous chapters, the general discussion is followed by a focus on India.

I know my dad has not done anything, because he is a good man. I hear everybody speak about my dad in a nice way.

Anas’s father, Jamil El-Banna, was among them. The American government said that they were enemies of the US and linked to the attack on New York on 11 September 2001. In most cases the governments of their countries were not asked or even informed about their imprisonment. Like other prisoners, El-Banna’s family got to know that he was in that prison only through the media. Families of prisoners, media or even UN representatives were not allowed to meet them. The US army arrested them, interrogated them and decided whether to keep them there or not. There was no trial before any magistrate in the US. Nor could these prisoners approach courts in their own country. Amnesty International, an international human rights organisation, collected information on the condition of the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay and reported that the prisoners were being tortured in ways that violated the US laws.

Many prisoners had tried protesting against these conditions by going on a hunger strike. Prisoners were not released even after they were officially declared not guilty. An independent inquiry by the UN supported these findings. The UN Secretary General said the prison in Guantanamo Bay should be closed down. The US government refused to accept these pleas.

Let us therefore look at the case of Saudi Arabia and the position of the citizens with regard to their government. Consider these facts: < The country is ruled by a hereditary king and the people have no role in electing or changing their rulers. < The king selects the legislature as well as the executive. He appoints the judges and can change any of their decisions. < Citizens cannot form political par- ties or any political organisations. Media cannot report anything that the monarch does not like. < There is no freedom of religion. Every citizen is required to be Muslim. Non-Muslim residents can follow their religion in private, but not in public. < Women are subjected to many public restrictions. The testimony of one man is considered equal to that of two women. This is true not just of Saudi Arabia. There are many countries in the world where several of these conditions exist. Ethnic massacr thnic massacr thnic massacr thnic massacr thnic massacre in K e in K e in K e in K e in Koso oso oso oso osovo You might think that this is possible in an absolute monarchy but not in countries which choose their rulers. Just consider this story from Kosovo. This was a province of Yugoslavia before its split. In this province the population was overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian. But in the entire country, Serbs were in majority. A narrow minded Serb nationalist Milosevic (pronounced Miloshevich) had won the election. His government was very hostile to the Kosovo Albanians. He wanted the Serbs to dominate the country. Many Serb leaders thought that Ethnic minorities like Albanians should either leave the country or accept the dominance of the Serbs. This is what happened to an Albanian family in a town in Kosovo in April 1999: “74-year-old Batisha Hoxha was sitting in her kitchen with her 77- year–old husband, Izet, staying warm by the stove. They had heard explosions but did not realise that Serbian troops had already entered the town. The next thing she knew, five or six soldiers had burst through the front door and were demanding “Where are your children?” “… they shot Izet three times in the chest” recalled Batisha. With her husband dying before her, the soldiers pulled the wedding ring off her finger and told her to get out. “I was not even outside the gate when they burned the house” … She was standing on the street in the rain with no house, no husband, no possessions but the clothes she was wearing.” This news report was typical of what happened to thousands of Albanians in that period.

This was one of the worst instances of killings based on ethnic prejudices in recent times. Finally several other countries intervened to stop this massacre. Milosevic lost power and was tried by the International Court of Justice for crimes against humanity. For each of the three cases of life without rights, mention an example from India. These could include the following: < Newspaper reports on custodial violence. < Newspaper reports on force-feeding of prisoners who go on hunger strike. < Ethnic massacre in any part of our country. < Reports regarding unequal treatment of women. List the similarities and differences between the earlier case and the Indian example. It is not necessary that for each of these cases you must find an exact Indian parallel.

Think of all the examples that we have discussed so far. Think of the victims in each example: the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, women in Saudi Arabia, Albanians in Kosovo. If you were in their position, what would you have wished? If you could, what would you do to ensure that such things do not happen to anyone? You would perhaps desire a system where security, dignity and fair play are assured to everyone. You might want, for example, that no one should be arrested without proper reason and information. And if someone is arrested, he or she should have a fair chance to defend themselves. You might agree that such assurance cannot apply to everything. One has to be reasonable in what one expects and demands of everyone else, for one has to grant the same to everyone. But you might insist that the assurance does not remain on paper, that there is someone to enforce these assurances, that those who violate these are punished. In other words, you might want a system where at least a minimum is guaranteed to everyone – powerful or weak, rich or poor, majority or minority. This is the spirit behind thinking about rights.

{"id": "class 9__sst__p92__c1", "text": "78 DEMOCRATIC POLITICS want to live happily, without fear and without being subjected to degraded treatment. For this we expect others to behave in such a way that does not harm us or hurt us. Equally, our actions should not also harm or hurt others. So a right is possible when you make a claim that is equally possible for others. You cannot have a right that harms or hurts others. You cannot have a right to play a game in such a way that it breaks the neighbour’s window. The Serbs in Yugoslavia could not have claimed the whole country for themselves. The claims we make should be reasonable. They should be such that can be made available to others in an equal measure. Thus, a right comes with an obligation to respect other rights. Just because we claim some thing it does not become our right. It has to be recognised by the society we live in. Rights acquire meaning only in society. Every society makes certain rules to regulate our conduct. They tell us what is right and what is wrong. What is recognised by the society as rightful becomes the basis of rights. That is why the notion of rights changes from time to time and society to society. Two hundred years ago anyone who said that women should have right to vote would have sounded strange. Today not granting them vote in Saudi Arabia appears strange. When the socially recognised claims are written into law they acquire real force. Otherwise they remain merely as natural or moral rights. The prisoners in Guantanamo Bay had a moral claim not to be tortured or humiliated. But they could not go to anyone to enforce this claim. When law recognises some claims they become enforceable. We can then demand their application. When fellow citizens or the government do not respect these rights we call it violation or infringement of our rights. In such circumstances citizens can approach courts to protect their rights. So, if we want to call any claim a right, it has to have these three qualities. Rights are reasonable claims of persons recognised by society and sanctioned by law.

Rights are necessary for the very sustenance of a democracy. In a democracy every citizen has to have the right to vote and the right to be elected to government. For democratic elections to take place, it is necessary that citizens should have the right to express their opinion, form political parties and take part in political activities. Rights also perform a very special role in a democracy. Rights protect minorities from the oppression of majority. They ensure that the majority cannot do whatever it likes. Rights are guarantees which can be used when things go wrong. Things may go wrong when some citizens may wish to take away the rights of others. This usually happens when those in majority want to dominate those in minority. The government should protect the citizens’ rights in such a situation. But sometimes elected governments may not protect or may even attack the rights of their own citizens. That is why some rights need to be placed higher than the government, so that the government cannot violate them. In most democracies the basic rights of the citizen are written down in the constitution. What are the examples of elected governments not protecting or even attacking the rights of their own citizens? Why do they do that? Reprint 2025-26"}

It means that the laws apply in the same manner to all, regardless of a person’s status. This is called the rule of law. Rule of law is the foundation of any democracy. It means that no person is above the law. There cannot be any distinction between a political leader, government official and an ordinary citizen. Every citizen, from the Prime Minister to a small farmer in a remote village, is subjected to the same laws. No person can legally claim any special treatment or privilege just because he or she happens to be an important person. For example, a few years ago a former Prime Minister of the country faced a court case on charges of cheating. The court finally declared that he was not guilty. But as long as the case continued, he had to go to the court, give evidence and file papers, just like any other citizen. This basic position is further clarified in the Constitution by spelling out some implications of the Right to Equality. The government shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth. Every citizen shall have access to public places like shops, restaurants, hotels, and cinema halls. Similarly, there shall be no restriction with regard to the use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads, playgrounds and places of public resorts maintained by government or dedicated to the use of general public. This might appear very obvious, but it was necessary to DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS In India, like most other democracies in the world, these rights are mentioned in the Constitution. Some rights which are fundamental to our life are given a special status. They are called Fundamental Rights. We have already read in Chapter 2 the preamble to our Constitution. It talks about securing for all its citizens equality, liberty and justice. Fundamental Rights put this promise into effect. They are an important basic feature of India’s Constitution. You already know our Constitution provides for six Fundamental Rights. Can you recall these? What exactly do these rights mean for an ordinary citizen? Let us look at these one by one. Everyone knows that the rich can have better lawyers in the courts. What is the point in talking about equality before law?

{"id": "class 9__sst__p94__c1", "text": "80 DEMOCRATIC POLITICS incorporate these rights in the Constitution of our country where the traditional caste system did not allow people from some communities to access all public places. The same principle applies to public jobs. All citizens have equality of opportunity in matters relating to employment or appointment to any position in the government. No citizen shall be discriminated against or made ineligible for employment on the grounds mentioned above. You have read in Chapter 4 that the Government of India has provided reservations for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes. Various governments have different schemes for giving preference to women, poor or physically handicapped in some kinds of jobs. Are these reservations against the right to equality? They are not. For equality does not mean giving everyone the same treatment, no matter what they need. Equality means giving everyone an equal opportunity to achieve whatever one is capable of. Sometimes it is necessary to give special treatment to someone in order to ensure equal opportunity. This is what job reservations do. Just to clarify this, the Constitution says that reservations of this kind are not a violation of the Right to Equality. The principle of non-discrimination extends to social life as well. The Constitution mentions one extreme form of social discrimination, the practice of untouchability, and clearly directs the government to put an end to it. The practice of untouchability has been forbidden in any form. Untouchability here does not only mean refusal to touch people belonging to certain castes.

In practical life it means absence of interference in our affairs by others – be it other individuals or the government. We want to live in society, but we want to be free. We want to do things in the way we want to do them. Others should not dictate us what we should do. So, under the Indian Constitution all citizens have the right to < Freedom of speech and expression < Assembly in a peaceful manner < Form associations and unions < Move freely throughout the country < Reside in any part of the country, and < Practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business. You should remember that every citizen has the right to all these freedoms. That means you cannot exercise your freedom in such a manner that violates others’ right to freedom. Your freedoms should not cause public nuisance or disorder. You are free to do everything which injures no one else. Freedom is not unlimited licence to do what one wants. Accordingly, the government can impose certain reasonable restrictions on our freedoms in the larger interests of the society. Freedom of speech and expression is one of the essential features of any democracy. Our ideas and personality develop only when we are able to freely communicate with others. You may think differently from others. Even if a hundred people think in one way, you should have the freedom to think differently and express your views accordingly. You may disagree with a policy of government or activities of an association. You are free to criticise the government or the activities of the association in your conversations with parents, friends and relatives. You may publicise your views through a pamphlet, magazine or newspaper. You can do it through paintings, poetry or songs. However, you cannot use this freedom to instigate violence against others. You cannot use it to incite people to rebel against government. Many Forms of Untouchability In 1999, P. Sainath wrote a series of newsreports in The Hindu describing untouchability and caste discrimination that was still being practiced against Dalits or persons belonging to Scheduled Castes. He travelled to various parts of the coun- try and found that in many places: < Tea stalls kept two kinds of cups, one for Dalits one for others; < Barbers refused to serve dalit clients; < Dalit students were made to sit separately in the classroom or drink water from separate picher; < Dalit grooms were not allowed to ride a horse in the wedding procession; and < Dalits were not allowed to use common handpump or if they did, the handpump was washed to purify it. All these fall under the definition of untouchability. Can you think of some examples from your own area?

Citizens have the freedom to hold meetings, processions, rallies and demonstrations on any issue. They may want to discuss a problem, exchange ideas, mobilise public support to a cause, or seek votes for a candidate or party in an election. But such meetings have to be peaceful. They should not lead to public disorder or breach of peace in society. Those who participate in these activities and meetings should not carry weapons with them. Citizens also can form associations. For example workers in a factory can form a workers’ union to promote their interests. Some people in a town may come together to form an association to campaign against corruption or pollution. As citizens we have the freedom to travel to any part of the country. We are free to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India. Let us say a person who belongs to the state of Assam wants to start a business in Hyderabad. He may not have any connection with that city, he may not have even seen it ever. Yet as a citizen of India he has the right to set up base there. This right allows lakhs of people to migrate from villages to towns and from poorer regions of the countries to prosperous regions and big cities. The same freedom extends to choice of occupations. No one can force you to do or not to do a certain job. Women cannot be told that some kinds of occupations are not for them. People from deprived castes cannot be kept to their traditional occupations. The Constitution says that no person can be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law. It means that no person can be killed unless the court has ordered a death sentence. It also means that a government or police officer cannot arrest or detain any citizen unless he has proper legal justification. Even when they do, they have to follow some procedures: < A person who is arrested and detained in custody will have to be informed of the reasons for such arrest and detention. < A person who is arrested and detained shall be produced before the nearest magistrate within a period of 24 hours of arrest. < Such a person has the right to consult a lawyer or engage a lawyer for his defence.

Yet the Constitution makers thought is was necessary to write down certain clear provisions to prevent exploitation of the weaker sections of the society. The Constitution mentions three specific evils and declares these illegal. First, the Constitution prohibits ‘traffic in human beings’. Traffic here means selling and buying of human beings, usually women, for immoral purposes. Second, our Constitution also prohibits forced labour or begar in any form. Begar is a practice where the worker is forced to render service to the ‘master’ free of charge or at a nominal remuneration. When this practice takes place on a life-long basis, it is called the practice of bonded labour. Finally, the Constitution also prohibits child labour. No one can employ a child below the age of fourteen to work in any factory or mine or in any other hazardous work, such as railways and ports. Using this as a basis many laws have been made to prohibit children from working in industries such as beedi making, firecrackers and matches, printing and dyeing. DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS On the basis of these news reports write a letter to the editor or a petition to a court highlighting the violation of right against exploitation: A petition was filed in the Madras High Court. The petitioner said a large number of children aged between seven and 12 were taken from villages in Salem district and sold at auctions at Olur Nagar in Kerala’s Thrissur district. The petitioner requested the courts to order the government to check these facts. (March 2005) Children, from the age of five, were employed in the iron ore mines in the Hospet, Sandur and the Ikal areas in Karnataka. Children were forced to carry out digging, breaking stones, loading, dumping, transporting and processing of iron ore with no safety equipment, fixed wages and working hours. They handled a high-level of toxic wastes and were exposed to mine dust, which was above the permissible level. The school dropout rate in the region was very high. (May 2005) The latest annual survey conducted by the National Sample Survey Organisation found that the number of female child labourers was growing both in rural and urban areas. The survey revealed there were 41 female child labourers per thousand worker population in rural areas as against the previous figure of 34 per thousand. The figure for male child had remained at 31.

In this case too, the Constitution makers were very particular to state it clearly. You have already read in Chapter 2 that India is a secular state. Most people in India, like anywhere else in the world, follow different religions. Some may not believe in any religion. Secularism is based on the idea that the state is concerned only with relations among human beings, and not with the relation between human beings and God. A secular state is one that does not establish any one religion as official religion. Indian secularism practices an attitude of a principled and equal distance from all religions. The state has to be neutral and impartial in dealing with all religions. Every person has a right to profess, practice and propagate the religion he or she believes in. Every religious group or sect is free to manage its religious affairs. A right to propagate one’s religion, however, does not mean that a person has right to compel another person to convert into his religion by means of force, fraud, inducement or allurement. Of course, a person is free to change religion on his or her own will. Freedom to practice religion does not mean that a person can do whatever he wants in the name of religion. For example, one cannot sacrifice animals or human beings as offerings to supernatural forces or gods. Religious practices which treat women as inferior or those that infringe women’s freedom are not allowed. For example, one cannot force a widow to shave head or wear white clothes. A secular state is one that does not confer any privilege or favour on any particular religion. Nor does it pun- ish or discriminate against people on the basis of religion they follow. Thus the government cannot com- pel any person to pay any taxes for the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion or religious institution. There shall be no religious instruction in the govern- ment educational institutions. In educational institutions managed by private bodies no person shall be compelled to take part in any religious instruction or to attend any religious worship.

Why are there no special guarantees for the majority? Well, for the simple reason that the working of democracy gives power to the majority. It is the language, culture and religion of minorities that needs special protection. Otherwise, they may get neglected or undermined under the impact of the language, religion and culture of the majority. That is why the Constitution speci- fies the cultural and educational rights of the minorities: < Any section of citizens with a distinct language or culture have a right to conserve it.

In some places people speaking a particular language are in majority; people speaking a different language are in a minority. For example, Telugu speaking people form a majority in Andhra Pradesh. But they are a minority in the neighbouring State of Karnataka. Sikhs constitute a majority in Punjab. But they are a minority in Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi. Read these news reports and identify the right that is being debated in each of these cases: < An emergency session of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) rejected the proposal to form a separate body to manage the affairs of Sikh shrines in Haryana.

If rights are like guarantees, they are of no use if there is no one to honour them. The fundamental rights in the Constitution are important because they are enforceable. We have a right to seek the enforcement of the above mentioned rights. This is called the Right to Constitutional Remedies. This itself is a Fundamental Right. This right makes other rights effective. It is possible that sometimes our rights may be violated by fellow citizens, private bodies or by the government. When any of our rights are violated we can seek remedy through courts. If it is a Fundamental Right we can directly approach the Supreme Court or the High Court of a state. That is why Dr. Ambedkar called the Right to Constitutional Remedies, ‘the heart and soul’ of our Constitution. Can the President of India stop you from approaching the Supreme Court to secure your fundamental rights? Fundamental Rights are guaranteed against the actions of the Legislatures, the Executive, and any other authorities instituted by the government. There can be no law or action that violates the Fundamental Rights. If any act of the Legislature or the Executive takes away or limits any of the Fundamental Rights it will be invalid. We can challenge such laws of the central and state governments, the policies and actions of the government or the governmental organisations like the nationalised banks or electricity boards.

For more details, visit http:/ /www.nhrc.nic.in Many cases of human rights violations in diverse fields are being brought to the public notice from across India. Human rights organisations and the media often criticise government agencies for not seriously pursuing these cases or catching the culprits. Someone had to intervene on behalf of the victims. This is where the National Human Rights Commission stepped in. This is an independent commission set up by law in 1993. Like judiciary, the Commission is independent of the government. The Commission is appointed by the President and includes retired judges, officers and eminent citizens. Yet it does not have the burden of deciding court cases. So it can focus on helping the victims secure their human rights. These include all the rights granted to the citizens by the Constitution. For NHRC human rights also include the rights mentioned in the UN sponsored international treaties that India has signed. The NHRC cannot by itself punish the guilty. That is the responsibility of courts. The NHRC is there to make independent and credible inquiry Reprint 2025-26"}

In much of the chapter we have focussed only on Fundamental Rights in the Constitution. You might think that Fundamental Rights granted by the Constitution are the only rights citizen have. This is not true. While Fundamental Rights are the source of all rights, our Constitution and law offers a wider range of rights. Over the years the scope of rights has expanded. Sometimes it leads to expansion in the legal rights that the citizen can enjoy. From time to time, the courts gave judgments to expand the scope of rights. Certain rights like right to freedom of press, right to information, and right to education are derived from the Fundamental Rights. Now school education has become a right for Indian citizens. The governments are responsible for providing free and compulsory education to all children up to the age of 14 years. Parliament has enacted a law giving the right to information to the citizens. This Act was made under the Fundamental Right to freedom of thought and expression. We have a right to seek information from government offices. Recently the Supreme Court has expanded the meaning of the right to life to include the right to food. Also, rights are not limited only to Fundamental Rights as enumerated in the Constitution. Constitution provides many more rights, which may not be Fundamental Rights. For example the right to property is not a Fundamental Right but it is a constitutional right. Right to vote in elections is an important constitutional right. Sometimes the expansion takes place in what is called human rights. These are universal moral claims that may or may not have been recognised by law. In that sense these claims are not rights going by the definition that we presented earlier. With the expansion of democracy all over the world, there is greater pressure on governments to accept these claims. Some international covenants have also contributed to the expansion of rights. Thus the scope of rights has been expanding and new rights are evolving over time. They are result of struggle of the people. New rights emerge as societies develop or as new constitutions are made. The Constitution of South Africa guarantees its citizens several kinds of new rights: < Right to privacy, so that citizens or their home cannot be searched, their phones cannot be tapped, their communication cannot be opened. < Right to an environment that is not harmful to their health or well- being; < Right to have access to adequate housing.

This has not yet become an international treaty. But human right activists all over the world see this as a standard of human rights. These include: < right to work: opportunity to everyone to earn livelihood by working < right to safe and healthy working conditions, fair wages that can provide decent standard of living for the workers and their families < right to adequate standard of living including adequate food, clothing and housing < right to social security and insurance < right to health: medical care during illness, special care for women during childbirth and prevention of epidemics < right to education: free and compulsory primary education, equal access to higher education.

K. Banerjee. You are married, so you must give your husband’s name. Your husband’s surname is Rao. So your name should be changed to Madhurima Rao.” She did not agree. She said “If my husband’s name has not changed after marriage, why should mine?” In your opinion who is right in this dispute? And why? 9 Thousands of tribals and other forest dwellers gathered at Piparia in Hoshangabad district in Madhya Pradesh to protest against their proposed displacement from the Satpura National Park, Bori Wildlife Sanctuary and Panchmarhi Wildlife Sanctuary. They argue that such a displacement is an attack on their livelihood and beliefs. Government claims that their displacement is essential for the development of the area and for protection of wildlife. Write a petition on behalf of the forest dwellers to the NHRC, a response from the government and a report of the NHRC on this matter. 10 Draw a web interconnecting different rights discussed in this chapter. For example right to freedom of movement is connected to the freedom of occupation. One reason for this is that freedom of movement enables a person to go to place of work within one’s village or city or to another village, city or state. Similarly this right can be used for pilgrimage, connected with freedom to follow one’s religion. Draw a circle for each right and mark arrows that show connection between or among different rights. For each arrow, give an example that shows the linkage. In every chapter we have done an exercise on reading the newspaper. Let us now try to write for the newspaper. Take any example from the reports discussed in this chapter or any other local example that you are familiar with and write the following: < Letter to the editor highlighting a case of human rights violation. < Press release by a human rights organisation. < A headline and a news item concerning a Supreme Court order related to Fundamental Rights. < Editorial on growing incidents of custodial violence.
